<h2 class="s6">ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
<p>THE Publisher feels great pleasure in presenting to the Church of
Christ this Edition of the reverend and venerable Author's Scripture
Portions for each Morning and Evening, blended in one Volume. It was
long the anxious wish of the Author to do so, but for circumstances
which it is not necessary here to detail, he was, while living, unable
to accomplish it, but anticipated with much pleasure their being so
arranged in this Edition. On the propriety of this arrangement there
needs no remark; it will immediately recommend itself to all.</p>
<p>The Publisher's earnest desire and prayer is, that the great Head of
the church may bless these labors of his highly honored servant, to the
spiritual edification of his redeemed people; and that while he has gone
to receive his reward, and entered into that rest prepared for those who
follow him, even aa he followed Christ, his works may continue to live
in the hearts of all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and in
truth.</p>

<h2 class="s6">PREFACE<br />
TO THE POOR MAN'S MORNING PORTION.</h2>
<p>THE title-page of this humble work sufficiently explains itself. It
is designed as a means, in the divine hand, to promote the Redeemer's
glory, and his people's happiness. 'It hath often struck me, that such a
method, under the blessing of the Lord, might prove eminently useful. By
publishing in this way, in little penny books, some sweet portion of
scripture for every day in the year, it might come within the reach of
all pockets, be within the reach of all hands, and bid fair to be read
when larger books are laid aside and forgotten.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, with the same view, that some few years since I sent
forth a Diary of this kind. But, in that work, the selection was
confined wholly to the promises. Experience hath since shewn, that
reference may be occasionally had, with great advantage, to other parts
of the word of God. In this, therefore, I have enlarged the plan. And
besides making extracts from the whole scripture, I have ventured to
add, under each passage, such thoughts as passed over my own mind in the
perusal, hoping that the Lord might render them profitable to
others.</p>
<p>It will be scarcely necessary to go over the same ground, by way of
preface, as was then done. But it cannot be too often said, by way of
reminding the believer, that the promises of God in Christ are evidently
meant by the gracious Giver of them for the daily comfort of his people.
And what is said of the promises, may be equally applied to the whole
tenor of covenant love which runs through the bible. Indeed, if the
truly awakened soul did but consider the word of God in this point of
view, and make use of it upon every occasion, as his own circumstances
are found to require, it could not fail of opening to his mind a
perpetual source of joy and consolation all the day.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> For what are the promises, but so many bonds and
engagements of a covenant God in Christ ? In them, the Lord hath pledged
himself to his people, as they stand related to Christ; and by the
fulfilment of them, they prove his faithfulness. So that, strictly and
properly speaking, God's promises are our charter</span><span
class="c6">; </span><span class="c5">his word our security ; his verily
and amen the breasts of consolation whence God's little ones are
nourished. And if the Lord's people would seek from the Holy Ghost the
testimony he gives in them concerning Jesus, and from general promises
make application of them to their own particular state and
circumstances, as they may require, they would find, upon numberless
occasions, that the Lord is speaking in them, and by them, to the souls
of his people, and in the sweetest and most endearing language. • I
would rather have God's amen, and his yea, anil verily, (said a tried
soul of old) than the promises or oath of .ill the men upon earth.' And
so would every believer, when from long experience of God's fulfilment
of his word and promises, he could " set to his seal that God is true."
But, if we never make use of God's promises, never exercise faith upon
them, never bring them before the throne for payment, nor make
memorandums when they are paid, how shall we know their value, or God's
love and faithfulness in their accomplishment?</span></p>
<p>Convinced of the importance of the thing itself, and with a view to
direct the minds of God's people to the daily exercise of this grace of
faith upon the word and promises of our covenant God in Christ, I have
here gathered out of the holy treasury some sweet portion for gracious
souls to feed on from day to day. And so fully persuaded am I of the
preciousness of this employment, that I am confident to say, if the
people of God would make it their uniform custom, morning by morning,
with the first return of day, and if possible, before the world hath
power to break in upon the mind, thus to have recourse to God'a word,
and (as David said he did) " to hearken what the Lord God would say
concerning him," they would find, and perhaps frequently before night,
sufficient cause to bless God for his faithfulness in the
accomplishmeut. Nay, sometimes indeed, they would discover the word to
be so immediate and direct to the present moment, as if the Lord had
left for a while the whole world, to draw nigh to them in those visits
of his love. Like the patriarch at Bethel, they would be constrained to
say, " Surely the Lord is in this place, (or in this word) and I knew it
not!"</p>
<p>It was thus holy men of old walked with God. They communed with the
Lord, and the Lord with them through the medium of his word. They made
known their wants, and the Lord made known his grace. Prayers went up,
and answers came down; and he " made all his goodness to pass before
them." In a more special manner they considered all the promises as
their own. And they accepted of them as given of the Lord, with this
express design, us if the Lord pledged himself by them to his people,
that they might bring them before the mercy-seat whenever they needed,
and plead for payment, Hence they kept house, feasted, and lived
joyfully upon them, when they had nothing else to live upon. And from
this cause it was, that after a succession of many generations from
father to son, they could, and did appeal to the uninterrupted
experience of every preceding history, and left it upon record for the
assurance and comfort of all that should come after, that " Not one
thing had failed of all the good things which the Lord had promised, but
all was come to pass as it is this day."</p>
<p>I cannot therefore but earnestly recommend to the gracious souls for
whom this little work is intended, similar conduct, that we may be the
patient " followers of them who now through faith and patience inherit
the promises." And a method so short, so easy, and so' practicable as is
here set forth, and which the most busy life, even among the labouring
poor of our people, cannot find much difficulty in performing, will, I
trust, be abundantly blessed of our gracious God. The labourer who is
straitened for time, and obliged sometimes to hasten to his work without
falling upon his knees in family prayer, may yet, even while putting on
his clothes, look at the Morning Portion; and if unable to run through
the observations which follow the scripture, may yet take with him the
scripture itself, and gather matter from it, under divine teaching, for
prayer and praise as he hastens on. And if this plan be constantly and
invariably followed up, without the omission of a single morning, I
venture to believe his diligence will be abundantly recompensed, upon
numberless occasions through life.</p>
<p>There is one advantage more, from the use of this little work, which
J detain the reader to mention, which will be, I conceive, of no small
importance in making it blessed, if so be the Lord should dispose the
minds of many gracious souls to the daily use of it; I mean the
communion of saints. This privilege of God's people is much spoken of;
but I rather fear, not so much attained to or regarded as it ought. And
yet, next to the rapture arising from communion with our glorious head,
what can open to more enjoyment than communion through him, with the
members of his mystical body ? I cannot help telling, in this short way,
many precious souls, whom I love in the faith, and who I know love me,
that I am looking forward to much spiritual enjoyment on this account,
from our use of this little work, humble as it is; not from my poor
labours in the observations which follow the scripture, but from God's
blessing on the scripture itself. Let it be supposed (what is very
possible) that many a true believer in Jesus, in different places be led
in one and the same moment of the morning, to the perusal of the Morning
Portion. Now, as the scripture is the same; as the Almighty Spirit, who
is the author of that scripture, the quickener in prayer, and the helper
of the infirmities of his people in prayer, is the same; and as he who
leads out the minds of his people at all times and in all places is the
same; and his blessed work in glorifying the Lord Jesus is always the
same; what can be more animating or delightful than the thought, that
all so engaged, in one and the same scripture, being under the same
gracious influence, must necessarily be all looking up to the Lord Jesus
in one and the same moment; and having fellowship with the Father, and
with his Son Jesus Christ, have spiritual union also one with another, "
as members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." Hence, though
far asunder from each other in the body, and in numberless instances
having never seen each other's face in the flesh, yet by virtue of
connection with our spiritual head, we truly participate in one and the
same divine life, and enjoy the very sweet and distinguishing felicity
of the communion of saints.</p>
<p>I stop the reader no longer than just to say, I humbly hope every
truly gracious and awakened soul who makes use of this Morning Portion,
will not fail to connect with the use of it a constant application to,
and dependance upon the Holy Ghost as the glorifier of the Father and of
the Son; without whose work upon the heart, not a promise can we plead;
not an argument can we use; not a grace can we exercise; even to the
knowledge of our wants, or of the fulness of the Lord Jesus to supply
them. But, my brother, let me add, if your soul be warmed under the
influence of the Holy Ghost, and while you read God's promise you find
grace to convert that promise into a prayer, and when you have thus
done, act faith upon it; this will be to realize the mercy, and to make
every promise your own. And Oh ! how truly blessed is it, when the
believer thus proves that " all the promises of God in Christ Jesus are
yea and amen, unto the glory of God by us."</p>

<h2 class="s6">PREFACE<br />
TO THE POOR MAN'S EVENING PORTION.</h2>
<p>A New edition of the Poor Man's Evening Portion being called for, I
beg to introduce it with a short preface.</p>
<p>The smallest attention to the work itself, will, it is hoped, be
sufficient to manifest to every reader, that in this little volume there
is nothing spoken of with an eye to salvation, but Jesus only. Christ is
the all in all. Indeed the very title implies as much. For unless Jesus
be the portion of his people, they can have none.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> The reader is therefore particularly requested to
have this in view through every part of this work; that, as the holding
forth the Lord Jesus, the one glorious portion of the church, is the
only design the author had in writing; so it may be the only expectation
of the reader in the perusal. Christ is here made, what the scriptures
of God every where make him, the Alpha and Omega; the first and the
last; the author and finisher of salvation. That foundation stone which
Jehovah laid in </span><span class="c6">Zion, </span><span class="c5">is
here shewn to be the only bottom on which the believer can rest the
whole spiritual building. Isa. xxviii. 16. That vine the Lord planted in
his vineyard, the only root from whence can be derived life, support,
and fruitfulness to the branches. John xv. 1. That head of his body, the
church, the sole source from whom " all the members having nourishment,
ministered and knit together, increase with the increase of God," Col.
ii. 19. In a word, Jesus is here set forth as substantially the whole of
the believer's portion, to live upon in time and to all
eternity.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the reader is yet further desired to observe, that as in
this little volume the Christ of God is considered as the whole of
salvation in Jehovah's appointment, so the believer, who really and
truly knows and accepts the Lord Jesus in this comprehensive character,
is supposed to be thus using Christ in his whole dependance upon him, to
the divine glory and his own happiness. I make a nice distinction in my
creed (and yet not more nice than important) between the actings of my
faith, and the almighty object of that faith; between what I feel, or
say, or do, and what the Lord Jesus Christ hath done in accomplishing
redemption; between what Jesus is in God the Father's view and what in
mine. Were I to substitute any thing of my own by way of recommendation,
or what is to the same effect, mingle any thing of my own, as a
procuring cause to the divine favour; this were to lessen the infinite
dignity and merit of the Redeemer's person and righteousness, and render
the covenant of grace uncertain and nugatory. In every mingling of this
kind, it might with truth be said, "O thou man of God, there is death in
the pot!" 2 Kings iv. 40. Moral virtues, pious dispositions, holiness of
life and conversation, yea, faith itself, as an act of man, form no part
in the justification of a sinner before God. All these are highly proper
in their place, accompany a work of grace wrought in the heart, and
become precious evidences of the renewed life. But all the while, these
are effects only, not causes; streams, not the fountain. Jesus is the
whole in redemption; for " there is salvation in no other." And the
glorious inscription over the very gate of heaven must be read to this
effect: " To the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made
us accepted in the beloved," Eph. i. 6.</p>
<p>If it were not for swelling this preface beyond the limit, I must
observe, I should humbly beg to add another observation on this
important point, and say, that I am every day more and more convinced
that the want of thus living wholly upon Christ, is the sole cause why
so many of God's children go so lean from day to day. For if he who is
the Father's glory, was made the believer's confidence; and while we
know (as we do know) that " in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge;" from him we seek for all we need; " wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption ;" there would be nothing
fluctuating in our happiness, while there was found nothing wavering and
unsteady in our faith. This would be to enter into the sweet retirings
of Jesus, and to realize that blessed promise, " Thou wilt keep him in
perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in
thee," Isa. xxvi. 4.</p>
<p>I send forth this feeble labour, under an humble hope, that he, with
whom is. the residue of the Spirit, will own it to the comfort of his
people. In the reading of it, may they hear the love-calls of Jesus, and
receive the love-tokens of Jesus, and find that self-invitation of the
Lord in every evening portion of their retirement. " Behold I stand at
the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will
come in to him, and will sup with him and he with me," Rev. iii. 20.</p>

<h3 class="s7"><span

1—Morning—Hebrews 8:8</h3>
<p>"Jesus Christ; <span id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#b1"></span>the
same yesterday, and to-day, and forever."—Heb. viii. 8.</p>
<p>Precious truth to open the year with, and to keep constantly in view
amidst all the fluctuating and changeable circumstances arising both
within and without, and all around! My soul, meditate upon it: fold it
up in thy bosom to have recourse to as may be required. Contemplate thy
Redeemer as he is here described. He is Jesus, thy Jesus; a Saviour, for
he shall save his people from their sins. He is Christ also; God thy
Father's Christ, and thy Christ: the Anointed, the Sent, the Sealed of
Jehovah. He is the same in his glorious Person, the same in his great
salvation:—"Yesterday;" looking back to everlasting: "To-day;" equally
so through all the periods of time: "For ever;" looking forward to the
eternity to come. And, blessed thought, he is the same in his love, in
the efficacy of his redemption; his blood to cleanse, his righteousness
to justify, his fulness to supply grace here and glory hereafter. And
what sums up the precious thought; amidst all thy variableness, thy
frames, thy fears, doubts, and unbelievings, he abideth faithful. He is,
he will be, he must be Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#chapter-4-sh2"></span>January
1—Evening—Revelation 21:5</h3>
<p>"And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new."—Rev. xxi. 5.</p>
<p>My soul! thou hast been engaged in the morning of the new year, with
contemplating the eternal and unchanging glory of thy Jesus, in his
person, work, offices, character, and relations, as in covenant
engagements for thy welfare: and thou hast found him to be an
everlasting and secure foundation to rest upon, and dwell in, for time
and for eternity.—Come now, in the evening of the day, and look up to
thy Redeemer in another precious point of view, and behold him as
creating all things new, while he himself, in the eternity of his
nature, remains for ever and unchangeably the same. Behold him on his
throne; and remember that one and the same throne belongs to God and the
Lamb, to intimate the unity of the Father and the Son in nature and
dignity; in will, worship, and power. When thou hast duly pondered this
view of Jesus, next listen to the important words he proclaims: "Behold,
I make all things new." Pause.-Hath he made thee a new creature? Yes!
if, as the Holy Ghost saith, "old things are passed away, and all things
are become new." The new creature is a thoroughly changed creature. It
is a new nature, not a new name. "A new heart will I give you," is the
blessed promise; "and a new spirit will I put within you." So that "if
any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." When this grand point is
fully and clearly ascertained, then, my soul, let the next consideration
from this scripture be, the blessed assurance here given, that Jesus
himself hath wrought it. This indeed cannot but follow; for surely the
same power that created the world out of nothing, must be necessary to
create a new spirit in the sinner's heart. In the old creation of
nature, though there was nothing to work upon, yet there was nothing to
oppose it: but in the unrenewed heart of a sinner there is every thing
to rise up against it; for "the carnal mind is enmity against God." Mark
it down then, my soul, that no power less than God's could have done
this, and thy Jesus from his throne declares it. Is there any thing more
to be gathered from this proclamation from the throne? Yes! He that
first creates the heart anew, ever lives to send forth the renewings of
the Holy Ghost: for creating grace, and renewing grace, are both alike
his. Hence, therefore, let thy morning and evening visits be to Him that
sitteth upon the throne, and maketh all things new. The same that hath
made new heavens, and the new earth, wherein righteousness dwelleth;
that hath made his tabernacle with men, and dwelleth in them; that
sitteth upon the throne, making all things new; the same is He,
yesterday, to-day, and for ever, that giveth power to the weak, and to
them that have no might he increaseth strength. Hither, my soul, come,
under all thy weakness, fears, doubts, tremblings, and the like: Jesus
can, and will renew thy strength. When I want a heart to pray, to
praise, to love, to believe; yea, when my heart and my flesh faint, and
hope fails: Oh! let me hear thy voice, thou that sittest upon the
throne, and makest all things new: for then wilt thou be the strength of
my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#chapter-4-sh3"></span>January
2—Morning—Luke 13:8-9</h3>
<p>"Lord! let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and
dung it: and if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou
shalt cut it down."—Luke xiii. 8, 9.</p>
<p>Do I not behold the Lord Jesus here represented in his glorious
office of our High Priest and Intercessor? And is it thus that he so
mercifully pleads for the awakened and unprofitable among his people?
Pause, my soul! Was it not from the effects of his intercession, that
the world itself was spared from instant destruction, when Adam first
brake through the fence of God's law? Is it not now by the same rich
grace that thousands are spared from year to year in Christ Jesus,
before that they are called to the knowledge of Christ Jesus? Nay my
soul! pause once more, over the view of this wonderful subject, and ask
thyself was it not from the same almighty interposition that thou was
kept from going down to the pit during the long, long period of thy
unregeneracy, while thou wert wholly unconscious of it? And was it from
thy gracious intercession, blessed Jesus, that I then lived, that I am
now spared, and, after all my barrenness, that another year of grace is
opening before me? Oh, precious, Precious Jesus! suffer me to be no
longer unfruitful in thy garden! Do, Lord, as thou hast said. Dig about
me, and pour upon me all the sweet influences of thy Holy Spirit, which,
like the rain, and the sun, and the dew of heaven, may cause me to bring
forth fruit unto God. And, Lord, if so unworthy a creature may drop a
petition at thy mercy seat for others, let the coming year be productive
of the same blessings to all thy redeemed; even to my poor unawakened
relations among them; and to thousands of those who are yet in nature's
darkness. Oh that this may be to them the acceptable year of the
Lord!</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#chapter-4-sh4"></span>January
2—Evening—Matthew 26:20</h3>
<p>"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."—Matt.
xxvi. 20.</p>
<p>And now the even is again come, will Jesus graciously sit down with
me? Wherefore, my soul, shouldest thou doubt the kindness of thy
condescending Lord? It may be allowed, that in many of the tenderest
incidents which passed between Jesus and his disciples while upon earth,
there were some peculiarly suited, and designed to have a personal
respect to them alone. But in many things they were the representatives
of Jesus's whole family; and hence every child of God may invite Jesus
to sit down with him, and enjoy conimunion with him; that while Jesus
speaks by his word to his people, and they to him; as his whole heart
and soul is theirs, so their whole hearts and souls may go forth, in all
the sweet exercises of love and faitb to him, and a holy familiarity may
take place between them. Come, then, thou gracious Lord, and sit down
with me, after all the toils of the day, and close the evening with some
blessed token of thy favour. I remember somewhat of thy past kindness,
and therefore I feel encouraged to seek a renewal of thy love. Do I not
know thee, O thou dear Lord! as a tried, a sure, an unchanging friend; a
brother born for adversity? And shall not this knowledge make me
confident for all that I have now to ask? Shall I go to the Lamb of God,
who hath died for me, as one under doubts and fears that he will not own
me, nor regard the purchase of his blood? No! precious Jesus, never will
I so dishonour thee, while thou hast given me, not the spirit of
bondage, but the spirit of adoption. Never will I lose sight of thee in
this endearing part of thy character; for thine own love, and not our
desert, is the rule of thy grace to thy people. Come, then, Lord Jesus,
in the stillness of this evening, and manifest thyself to my heart
otherwise than thou dost to the world. If Jesus will but speak, yea,
whisper in the words of his holy scripture, I shall feel all the power,
sweetness, and energy of its saving truths. One view of Jesus's heart,
and the love in it to poor sinners, will bear down all the cries of
unbelief, all the clamours of the world, and all the temptations of the
enemy. Yea, Lord, I shall for a while forget every sorrow, every pain,
every difficulty and trial. And will not the tempter flee, when he
beholds my poor feeble soul upheld in Jesus's arms, and lying in Jesus's
bosom? Blessed be my God and Saviour, I feel a sense of thy
strengthening and refreshing presence. My faith lays hold of thee,
neither will I let thee go, O thou, the hope of Israel, and the Saviour
thereof! "And why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a
wayfaring man that turned aside to tarry but for a night?"</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#chapter-4-sh5"></span>January
3—Morning—Isaiah 63:4</h3>
<p><span class="c5">"The year of my redeemed is come." </span><span
class="c8">Isa. lxiii. 4.</span></p>
<p>Yes! from everlasting the precise period of redemption was
determined, and the appointed time of the vision could not tarry. Every
intermediate event ministered to this one glorious area-redemption by
Jesus. The church was in Egypt four hundred and thirty years, and in
Babylon seventy. But we are told in the former instance, 'the self-same
night' the Lord brougbt, them forth with their armies; and the latter
did not out stay the hour of their promised deliverance. So when the
fulness of time was come, the Son of God came for the redemption of his
people. And observe how graciously Jesus speaks of them; he calls them
his redeemed. They were so in the covenant from everlasting; and when
the time arrives for calling them by his grace, he claims them as the
gift of his Father, and the purchase of his blood. My soul, is this thy
jubilee year? Art thou living as the redeemed of the Lord? If so, plead
with thy Redeemer for the holy renewed visits of his love to thee, and
for the year of redemption to all his unawakened.</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_000.xhtml#chapter-4-sh6"></span>January
3—Evening—John 20:20</h3>
<p>"He shewed unto them his hands and his side",—John xx. 20.</p>
<p>My Lord and my God I would say, while thou openest to me such a view,
and while I would look into and read thine heart in it. And what was
such a display designed for, dearest Lord? I think thou hast taught me
to discover. Was it not as if Jesus had said, See here the marks of your
sure redemption. From hence issued the blood that hath cleansed you from
all sin. And this blood hath a voice. It is a speaking blood, which
speaketh better things than that of Abel. For his blood cried for
vengeance, mine for pardon. It speaketh for thee to my Father of his
covenant promises. And it speaketh to thee from my Father of thy sure
acceptance in my salvation.'- Neither was this all. For surely, dearest
Jesus, when thou shewedst thine hands and thy side, it was also as if
thou hadst said, I see here an opening to my heart. Here put in all you
wish to tell my Father, and I will bear it to him with all my warmest
affections. And let all my disciples, in every age of my church do this.
I will be the bearer of all their suits. And sure they may be both of my
love and of my success for them; for I will carry all that concerns them
in this opening to my heart.' Precious Lord! cause me often to view with
the eye of faith this gracious interview of thine with thy disciples.
And as in the evening of the day the disciples were thus favoured with
thy presence, and so rich a manifestation of thy love; so, Lord, make me
to realize the scene afresh, and very often in the silence of the night
may my soul be going forth in the full enjoyment of this spiritual
blessing! Yea, Jesus! let me behold thine hands and thy side, and learn
day by day to put therein all I would tell my God and Father of thy
great salvation, and my firm reliance upon it; until from a life of
faith I come to enter upon a life of absolute enjoyment, and behold thee
still as the Lamb that hath been slain for the redemption of thy people,
in the midst of the throne, leading the church to the living fountains
of waters, where all tears are wiped away from all eyes.</p>

<p>"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to
Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be
thou perfect."—Gen. xvii. 1.</p>
<p>Our old bibles, in their margin, have retained the original El
Shaddai, which we now read God Almighty, and marked it also God
A11-sufficient, meaning that Jehovah in covenant with Jesus, as the head
of his people, is all-sufficient in himself, and all-sufficient for all
their need in time and to eternity. He is God All-sufficient, or of many
paps, many breasts of consolotion, (as some derive the word) for his
faithful ones to suck at and draw from, in an endless supply. Here then,
my soul, take this sweet title of thy covenant God and Father in Christ
Jesus for thy daily meditation, both at the opening, and through all the
periods of the coming year. And as even at old age the Lord still opened
to Abraham this precious source for his comfort, so look up in Jesus and
behold it as thine. And Oh, my soul! do thou walk before him in the
perfect righteousness of God thy Saviour, and thus daily keep up
fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"And David said, seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?"—1 Sam.
xviii. 23.</p>
<p>Did David indeed set by so high an honour in being allied to the
family of an earthly prince; what then must be the dignity to which
believers are called, in being heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ?
The apostle was so lost in the contemplation of this unspeakable mercy,
that he cried out with holy rapture, " Behold! what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!"
My soul, art thou begotten to this immense privilege? Ponder well thy
vast inheritance. Not a barren title, not an empty name; this
relationship brings with it a rich revenue of all temporal, spiritual,
and eternal blessings. Sons in law and in grace to God in Christ,
believers are born to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and
that fadeth not away. They have the spirit of adoption and of grace; and
" because they are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
their hearts, whereby they cry, Abba, Father." Are they poor in outward
circumstances? Bread shall be given, and water shall be sure; and their
defence Shall be the munitions of rocks. Are they afflicted in body or
in mind? their back shall be proportioned to their burden ; and as their
day is so shall their strength be. Every child shall have his own
portion, and the Father's blessing sanctifying all. Yea, death itself is
in the inventory of the inheritance of a child of God; for so far is
death from separating from God, that it brings to God. What sayest thou,
0 my soul! to these things? Art thou, like David, a poor man and lightly
esteemed? Look up and, enjoy thy relationship in Jesus, and from this
time do thou cry out, in the words of the prophet, and say unto God, "My
Father! thou art the guide of my youth."</p>

thine. I am thine by the gift of GOD the FATHER; by thine own betrothing
me to thyself; by the HOLY GHOST anointing me in thee, and making me one
with thee, and in thee, before the world. And I am thine in the recovery
of the church from Adam's fall and transgression by the sacrifice of
thyself: for thou hast bought me with thy blood, and made me thereby the
conquest of thine HOLY SPIRIT. And now through thy divine teaching I can
and do discover, that from everlasting thy desire was towards thy
redeemed ones, and even when dead in trespasses and sins, it was thy
desire to quicken them into life, and bring them to thyself. And even
now, notwithstanding all my backwardness to thee, thou restest in thy
love, and thou art calling me by thy grace, and seeking continual
fellowship in ordinances, and by thy word and providences; all which
prove that thy desire is towards me. And as to the everlasting enjoyment
of all thy church above, thy prayer to thy Father manifested thy desire,
when thou saidst, "Father, I will that they whom thou, hast given me be
with me to behold, my glory!" Are these then the desires of my God and
Saviour, my Husband, my Brother, my Friend? And shall my heart be thus
cold towards thee? Oh for the reviving influences of thy Spirit, that I
May cry out with, the church, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth; for thy love is better than wine."</p>

<p>“And Melchizedeck, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine: and
he was the priest of the Most High God"—Gen. xiv. 18.</p>
<p>Was it not in the evening of the day, when Abrabam, returning from
the slaughter of the kings, met this illustrious person? And will Jesus,
my Melchizedeck, meet and bless me in, the evening of this day, after my
return from conflicts, trials, and exercises? I would fain indulge the
sweet thought. Surely this Melchizedeck could be no other than Jesus.
And did he love his people then - and doth he not love them now? Did
Jesus witness their battles, and come forth and refresh them? And is, he
not, Jesus still?—Sit down, My soul, and attend to what the Holy Ghost
saith of this Melchizedeck; and see whether, through his teaching, thou
canst make no discoveries of Jesus. Was this Melchizedeck priest of the
Most High God? And who but the Son of God was ever sworn into this
office with an oath? Was Melchizedeck a priest for ever? Who but Jesus
was this? Had Melchizedeck neither beginning of days nor end of life?
And who but Jesus is the first and the last? Was Melchizedeck without
father, without mother? And who of Jesus shall declare his generation?
Did Melchizedeck bless the great father of the faithful? And hath not
God the Father sent his Son to bless us, in turning away every one of us
from our iniquities? Did the king of Salem bring forth bread and wine to
refresh the patriarch and his people? And doth not our King of
righteousness bring forth at his supper the same, as memorials of his
love: yea, his own precious body, which is meat indeed, and his blood,
which is drink indeed? Precious Jesus, thou great Melchizedeck! bring
forth anew, this night, these tokens of thy love. Make thyself known to
me in breaking of bread and prayer. And whilst thou art imparting to me
most blessed views of thyself, give me to apprehend and know thee, and
richly enjoy thy soul-strengthening, soul-comforting presence. And Oh!
for grace from thee, Lord, and the sweet influences of thine Holy
Spirit, that, like the patriarch Abraham, I may give thee tythes of all
I possess! It is true, I have nothing, and am nothing, yea, in myself am
worse than nothing. But of thine own would I give thee. Like the poor
widow in the gospel, I would cast all my living into thy treasury. The
two mites, which make a farthing, my soul and body, do I give unto thee.
And those are both thine, by creation, by gift, by purchase, and by the
conquest of thy grace. Take, therefore, all; and enable me to present my
soul and body a living sacriflce, holy, acceptable unto the Lord, which
is my reasonable service.</p>

<p>"For verily he took not on him the nature of angels."—Heb. ii.
16.</p>
<p>Contemplate, my soul, the peculiar sweetness of that grace which was
in thy Jesus, when, for the accomplishment of thy salvation, he passed
by the nature of angels to take upon him thy nature. There were but two
sorts of transgressors in the creation of God; angels and men. But
angels are left in everlasting chains, under darkness, to the judgment
of the great day. And falled, sinful, rebellious man, finds the grace of
redemption. Had Jesus taken their nature, would not this have been
nearer to his own? Would not their services have been vastly superior to
ours? Would not the redemption of beings so much higher in rank and
intellect, have opened a far larger revenue of praise to our adorable
Redeemer? Pause over these thoughts, my soul, and then consider
therefrom how our Jesus, in his unequalled condescension, hath thereby
the more endeared himself to thy love. And learn hence, that if Jesus
needs not the service of angels, how is it possible that man can be
profitable to God! And the simple act of faith of a poor fellow sinner,
in believing the record that God hath given of his dear Son, gives more
honour to God than all the services of men or angels for ever. Mark this
down as a blessed truth; Jehovah is more glorified by thy faith and
trust in him, than by all thy works. Lord, give me this faith, that I
may cleave to thee, hang upon thee, follow thee, and never give over
looking unto thee, until mine eye-strings break and my heart-strings
fail and then as now, be thou "the strength of mine heart, and my
portion for ever!"</p>

<p>"When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher
than I."—Ps. lxi. 2.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord! I would make this my morning, noon, and evening petition,
that the great glorifier of Jesus would gently lead me to him who is a
rock, and whose work is perfect. I know, dearest Lord, in theory, and
can even reason upon it in seasons of coolness, that thy strength and
thy security never fail; the failure is in me and my unbelief. And it is
only when I lose sight of thee and thy promise, that I am tossed about
with doubts and misgivings. If Jesus be out of sight, and thwarting
dispensations arise, Oh! how soon is my poor forgetful heart ready to
exclaim with the church of Old, "I said, my strength and my hope is
perished from the Lord." Then come on the reasonings of flesh and blood.
And then the question, whether my interest in Jesus and his salvation be
sure? And then my poor heart goes forth, like the dove of Noah from the
ark, having lost sight of Jesus, and can find no resting-place for the
sole of my foot. Oh! Lord the Spirit, in all such seasons, do thou "lead
me to the Rock that is higher than I." If thou, blessed leader of the
Lord's distressed ones, wouldest be my pilot when those storms are
beating upon me, I should soon be blown upon the firm landing-place of
Jesus's security. Oh! how should I ride out the storm even when the
tempest was highest, as long as God the Holy Ghost enabled me to cast
the anchor of faith upon this eternal rock of Jesus. Oh! lead me then,
thou sovereign Lord, continually to my all-precious Jesus. Open the port
of communication, and keep it constantly open, between Christ and my
soul. Faith will find a soft and quiet bed to sleep on, in the arms of
Jesus, and no noise of wars shall break the soul's rest while reposing
on him; for so the promise runs: " Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee." Oh ! then
once again, I send up the earnest cry of my soul, let it be continually
answered in mercy! "When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the Rock
that is higher than I."</p>

<p>Great indeed, and but one! for salvation is in no other; neither is
there any other name under heaven given among men whereby we can be
saved. My soul, hast thou considered Jesus in this precious point of
view? Hast thou beheld him both in his divine and human nature, how
unspeakably glorious in himself, and how enriching to the souls of his
people? Art thou a spiritual merchantman, seeking goodly pearls? And is
Jesus the one, the only one, costly, precious, and so infinitely
desirable in thine eye, that thou art willing to sell all, that thou
wouldest part with millions of worlds, rather, than lose Christ? Hast
thou found him in the field of his scripture, and dost thou ask how
shall I buy? Listen to his own most gracious words: counsel thee to buy
of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich." Yes, thou
generous Lord! I am come to buy of thee without money and without price.
For well I know, through thy teaching, that neither the obedience of men
or angels can purchase the least title to thee, but thine own precious
merits and thine atoning blood. Arid now, Lord, possessing thee, I
possess all things; and will give up all beside, and part with all, and
forget all, since Jesus is mine, and I am his, in time and to all

<p>“Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold and see if there
be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the
Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger."—Lamentations i.
12.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus! I would sit down this evening, and looking up to thee,
ask the instructions of thy blessed Spirit, to unfold some of the many
tender inquiries wrapped up in this question of my Lord's. Whatever the
mournful prophet's views were of the churches sorrow, when he wrote his
book of Lamentations, surely sorrow never had its full potion poured
out, but in the cup of trembling which thou didst drink. And as in all
the afflictions of thy people, thou wert afflicted, added to all thine
own personal sufferings, their's also thou didst sustain. And where
shall I begin, dear Lord, to mark down the amazing history of thy
sorrow? From the manger to the cross, every path was suffering. Indeed
thou art, by way of emphasis, called " the man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief." Thorns and thistles the earth is made to bring forth, to
human nature at large; but as in taking away this curse, thou becamest a
curse for thy people, none but thyself, dearest Jesus, was ever crowned
with thorns; as if to testify the supremacy of thy sufferings. And did
all our curses indeed fall upon thee? Was all the Father's wrath in the
full vials of his anger against sin, made to light upon thee? Didst thou
wade through all and sustain all, and bear all, on purpose that thy
redeemed might be delivered? Did great drops of blood in a cold night
(when a fire of coals became needful to warm thy disciples) fall from
thy sacred body, from the agony of thy soul's suffering? Did the Son of
God, who from all eternity lay in his bosom, the only begotten and
dearly beloved of his affection, indeed die under amazement and
exceeding sorrow, and the cry of his soul issue forth of his Father's
desertion? Were these among the sorrows of Jesus? And is it nothing to
you, all ye that pass by? Is it nothing to you, Oh! ye that by disregard
and indifference would crucify the Son of God afresh and put him to an
open shame? Come hither, ye careless and unconcerned; come hither, ye
fools, that make a mock of sin; come hither, ye drunkards and defiled of
every description and character, whose cups of licentiousness and mirth
have mingled for him the wormwood and the gall; behold Jesus, and say,
"is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?" My soul, bring the question
home to thine own heart, and never give over the solemn meditation. It
is indeed to thee every thing that is momentous and eternally
interesting. Yes! precious Jesus! every wound of thine speaks; every
feature, every groan, every cry pleads for me, and with me. If I forget
thee, O thou bleeding Lamb! let my right hand forget her cunning. If I
do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; yea,
if I prefer not the solemn meditation of Gethsemane and Calvary above my
chief joy.</p>

8—Morning—John 2:10</h3>
<p>"Thou hast kept the good wine until now."—John ii. 10.</p>
<p>The good wine of the gospel must be Jesus himself, for He, and He
alone, trod the wine-press of his Father's wrath, when the Lord bruised
him and put him to grief. This is the wine which, in scripture, is said
to cheer both God and men; for when God's justice took the full draught
of it for the sins of the redeemed, the Lord declared himself well
pleased. And when the poor sinner, by sovereign grace, is first made to
drink of the blood of the Lamb, he feels constrained to say, the Lord
had kept the good wine until now; for never before had his soul been so
satisfied. Oh, precious Jesus' how sweet is the thought! Thy first
miracle converted water into wine. Moses' ministry, under thy
commission, was first manifested in turning water into blood. Yes, dear
Lord! when once thy grace hath wrought upon the heart of a sinner, thou
makest his most common mercies, like water, to become richer than wine.
Whereas the law, which is the ministration of death, as long as the poor
sinner continues under its power, makes all its enjoyments to partake of
the curse. 0 for continued manifestations of thy glory, dearest Lord!
Give me to drink of thy best wine, my beloved, which goeth down sweetly,
causing the lips of those that sleep to speak.</p>

8—Evening—John 5:2</h3>
<p>"A pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda."—John v.
2.</p>
<p>Go down, my soul this evening, to the pool and cloisters of Bethesda,
as the prophet was commanded to go down to the potter's house.
Peradventure thy Lord may do by thee as he graciously did by him; cause
thee to bear his words. The pool of Bethesda was the place or house of
mercy. It was so to the bodies of those whom the Lord healed there. It
becomes so now to the souls of those who behold Jesus in the
representation. In the cloisters around the pool, lay a great multitude
of sick, waiting for a cure. Ponder over the miseries of our fallen
nature. It is always profitable to note distinguishing blessings. Are
hospitals numerous, frequently filled, numbers sick, numbers dying,
numbers dead? Am I in health? And will not the voice of praise go forth
to the bountiful Author in a consciousness of the distinguishing mercy?
The waters of this pool were blessed with a miraculous quality. One poor
creature, and but one, at that season when the waters were moved by the
descent of an angel into the pool, (most probably discovered by the
agitation of the water) was cured of whatsoever disease he had. Sweet
testimony, before the coming of Christ, that the Lord had not left his
people, notwithstanding the very languishing state in which the church
then was. But, my soul, attend to the spiritual beauty of this
interesting record. The pool of Bethesda, no doubt, was intended as a
typical representation of the fountain opened to the house of David, and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. And the
Son of God, by visiting the pool, and healing a poor paralytic by the
sovereign word of his own power, without the means, seemed very plainly
to intimate the inexpediency of the type, when the person signified was
present. Behold in this pool then, the house of mercy always open. In a
world like the present, full of misery because full of sin, multitudes
of folk, impotent in soul, should be found in the cloisters of
ordinances, and under the means of grace. Jesus loves those places.
These are his favourite haunts. Here he comes to heal and to impart
blessings; and that not to one only at a season. In his blood a
sovereign efficacy is found for all who are washed in it. He cures the
guilt of sin, destroys its dominion, roots out its sting, and raises
from the death of sin. And he doth all in so gracious, so condescending,
so sovereign a manner, as cannot but endear him to every heart. Blessed
be the Lord that hath led me to his pool at Bethesda, and hath heated my
soul in his blood. "The Lord is my strength and my song, and he is
become my salvation."</p>

9—Morning—Exodus 34:7</h3>
<p>"That will by no means clear the guilty,"—Exod. xxxiv. 7.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over these solemn words! Will not Jehovah clear the
guilty? And art thou not guilty? How then wilt thou come before God,
either now or hereafter? Hearken, my soul, to what thy God hath also
said; "deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom."
Oh! soul-reviving, soul-comforting words! yes, Jesus became my surety,
took my guilt, and bought me out of the hands of law and justice. God
hath not therefore cleared the guilty, without taking ample satisfaction
on the person of the sinner's surety. Hence now the double claim of
justice and grace demands the sinner's pardon. Here then, my soul, rest
thy present and thine everlasting plea. Keep up a daily and hourly
remembrance of it at the mercy seat. While Jesus lives, and lives there
as thine advocate, never doubt thy acceptance in the beloved: guilty as
thou art in thyself, yet spotless in him. The same God which made thy
Jesus to be sin for thee, who knew no sin, makes thee the righteousness
of God in him.</p>

9—Evening—Matthew 3:9</h3>
<p>"And think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our
Father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham."—Matt. iii. 9.</p>
<p>Precious are the doctrines contained in the bosom of this most
blessed scripture! May the almighty Author of his own holy word, open to
me, this evening, some of the many divine things contained in it. And
first, my soul, remark that the blessing to Abraham and to his seed was
not through the law. He is not a jew that is one outwardly. The blood of
nature which ran through Abrabam's veins, had no respect to the grace
which was planted in Abraham's heart. If ye be Christ's, is the
relationship, for then the Holy Ghost beareth witness ye are Abraham's
seed, and heirs according to the promise. No Ishmaels, no sons of
Keturah, not of the bond-women, but of the free. And what a sweet
thought it is also to consider, that as God called Abraham when an
idolater, so now the gifts and callings of God are the same. And in
every call doth he not say, "look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and
to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged? Look unto Abraham your
father, and unto Sarah that bare you, for I called him alone, and
blessed him, and increased him." Do not overlook this, my soul, it, will
always tend to exalt and endear thy Jesus. But let us not stop here.
Supposing, as some have thought, that the Baptist was standing on the
banks of Jordan, and referring to the twelve stones which Joshua
formerly placed there for a memorial (Josh. iv. 9.) of the twelve tribes
of Israel; the allusion to the creating souls from such unpromising, and
unheard-of means, becomes a most delightful thought to a child of God,
to comfort him concerning the sovereignty of God's grace. Pause, my
soul, and let the thought fill up thine evening's meditation, lie down
with thee, and form thy songs of the night. Had it pleased thy covenant
God in Christ so to have wrought his salvation, no doubt, nothing could
have been more easy to his Omnipotency than to have raised heirs of
glory from the stones. When the human soul, which came out of the
Almighty Maker's hand at first pure and holy, had by apostacy lost all
its beauty and loveliness, how quickly might Jehovah have reduced it to
its orignal nothingness, and from the stones of the earth raised up a
seed to praise him! But here, as in a thousand instances, God's ways are
not our ways, nor his thoughts our thoughts. To glorify his dear Son,
the soul, though polluted and defiled, shall be made infinitely more
precious by redemption, than it was by creation when unpolluted.
Beautiful as it was before it fell, yet it is vastly more beautiful now,
when washed in the Redeemer's blood. Had it continued in its
uprightness, it would have been but the uprightness of the creature,
still liable to fall at any time from its integrity, as Adam did. But
now united to Jesus, the righteousness and purity of the redeemed is the
righteousness and holiness of the Redeemer, and cannot possibly be lost
or forfeited any more. "Thy Maker is thine husband, the Lord of Hosts is
his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole
earth shall he be called." Pause, my soul! Hast thou a part, an interest
in this blessedness? Art thou a poor gentile by nature and practice, an
alien to the commonwealth of Israel, a stranger to the covenants of
promise, and once without hope, without God, and without Christ in the
world, and art thou now brought nigh by the blood of Christ? Surely had
God raised a seed from the stones of the earth to Abraham to bless him,
the act would not have been more sovereign, neither the mercy more
gracious! Hath Jehovah raised thee from death, sin, and hell; washed
thee in the blood of the Lamb; regenerated thee by his blessed Spirit;
made thee a temple for himself, and formed thee for his glory? O then
join the prophet's song, and cry out in his words, " Sing, O ye heavens!
for the Lord hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break
forth into singing, ye mountains: O forest, and every tree therein: for
the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel."</p>

<p>"My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to
feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies."—Song vi. 2.</p>
<p>Wonderful condescension! Jesus, the beloved of all his people, is
indeed come down into his garden, the church; for he loves the sacred
walks of a spot so near and so dear to him, which is at once the gift of
his Father, and the purchase of his own most precious blood. Moreover,
he hath gathered it out of the world's wide wilderness and separated it
as a sacred enclosure by his distinguishing grace. Surely then he will
visit it. Yes, here he constantly walks; here he comes to observe the
souls of his people as trees of his own right-hand planting. He is said
to feed here; for the graces of his Spirit, which he calls forth into
exercise, are more fragrant to him than all the spices of the east. And
all the beauty and whiteness of the lily is not to be compared to the
glory, loveliness, and sweet-smelling savour of the righteousness of
Jesus, in which he beholds the souls of his redeemed as clad. And Oh!
here Jesus is gathering them to himself in all the different degrees of
their growth, from the first moment of planting them in his garden,
until he transplants them into the paradise of God. Art thou, my soul,
in this garden of Jesus? Art thou rejoicing under his gracious hand? Are
the dews of his ordinances, in this enclosure of thy Lord, dropping upon
thee!</p>

10—Evening—Acts 27: 23</h3>
<p>"Whose I am, and whom I serve."—Acts xxvii. 23.</p>
<p>Here is a delightful subject for an evening meditation, if, like the
apostle, who thus expressed himself, a child of God can take up the same
words, and from the same well-grounded authority. Paul was in the midst
of a storm, with not only the prospect, but the certainty of shipwreck
before him, when he thus reposed himself in his covenant relations. An
angel had informed him of what would happen; and had bidden him to be of
good courage. But Paul's chief confidence arose from the consideration
of whose property he was, and whose service he was engaged in. See to
it, my soul, that thy assurance be the same; then thy security in every
dark night will be the same also. For if thou art Jesus' property,
depend upon it, thou wilt be Jesus' care. Hath Jesus bought thee with
his blood; made thee his by grace; and hast thou voluntarily given up
thyself to him in a covenant not to be broken? Hath the Lord spoken to
thee by the sweet voice of his word, brought home to the heart in the
gracious application of his Spirit? Doth he say to thee, as to Jacob of
old; "Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy
name, thou art mine?" Oh! then how sure will be the promise that
follows; "When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee, and
through the rivers they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee: for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
Saviour." If, in a view of covenant relationship, thou canst say with
Paul, concerning Jesus, "whose I am;" do thou next search after the
love-tokens of thine own heart, in covenant engagements also, and, see
whether thou canst adopt Paul's language in the, other particular, and
say as he did, "whom I serve." Is Jesus the one only object of thy love?
Did be give himself for thee; and hath he by his Holy Spirit enabled
thee to give thyself unto him? Hast thou given thyself to him, and given
thyself for him, and art thou willing to part with every thing for the
promotion of his glory? Depend upon it, the real confidence of the soul
can only be found in faith's enjoyment of these things. My soul! drop
not into the arms of sleep before thou hast brought this point to a
decision. No storm of the night, no tempest without, will alarm, while
Jesus, by his Holy Spirit, speaks peace within. If Jesus be thine, then
all is thine; and as thou art his, every promise is made over to thee
with him, whose thou art, and whom thou dost serve. Sweet promise to lie
down with on the bed of night, or the bed of death: "My people shall
dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
resting places." Isa. xxxii. 18.</p>

11—Morning—Revelation 22:16</h3>
<p>"I am the bright and morning Star."—Rev. xxii. 16.</p>
<p>How oft, in some dark wintry morning, like the present, have I bebeld
the morning star shining with loveliness, when all the other lights of
heaven were put out! But how little did I think of thee, thou precious
light and life of men! Thou art indeed the bright and morning Star in
the firmament of thy church, in thy word, and in the souls of thy
redeemed. Henceforth, dearest Jesus, let the morning visit of this sweet
planet to our darkened earth remind me of thee, amidst all the gross
darkness by which in nature we are surrounded. Sure pledge of day as
this beneficial star is, yet not more sure than thou in the day-dawn and
day-star of prophecy, which ministered to thy coming; and in the
twilight of grace upon the soul, the forerunner of a glorious day. Be
thou my morning song, my noontide joy, my evening meditation, and
midnight light. Through all the wintry seasons of my pilgrimage, shine
forth, sweet Jesus, upon my soul. Oh! ye sons of sloth, ye children of
darkness, and of night, rouse from your beds of drowsiness, before the
sleep of death seal up your eyes in everlasting darkness. Jesus, the
Morning Star, now shines; and are long, Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness,
will appear, no more to go down, and all the sons of God will shout for
joy.</p>

11—Evening—Song of Solomon 8:13</h3>
<p>"Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy
voice; cause me to hear it."—Song viii. 13.</p>
<p>Hark, my soul! Is not this Jesus speaking to thee? Listen to thy
Lord, for sweet is his voice, and his countenance is comely. But how
know I that Jesus is speaking to me in these words of the Song? Search,
and see if it be so. What are these gardens, the Lord speaks of? Surely
the special congregations of his churches. Is not Jesus's church, one
universal church, of jew and gentile, made up of the several assemblies
of the faithful throughout the earth? And art thou, my soul, brought
into the church of Jesus, by regeneration, by adoption, by the special
call of God the Father, the purchase of Christ's blood, the conquest of
the Spirit, and the voluntary surrender of thine heart to God? And dost
thou dwell in those gardens? Are Jesus's ordinances thy delight; his
holy days thy beloved days; his presence thy joy; his tabernacles
amiable to thee? And is it the uniform desire of thine heart, to dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of thy life; to behold the beauty
of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple? Oh! the blessedness of such a
dwelling! the felicity of the souls who dwell in it! Is it not to all
such who keep his sabbaths, and join themselves to the Lord to serve
him, that the Lord Jehovah speaketh in that most gracious promise, "Even
unto them will I give in mine house, and within my walls, a place and a
name better than of sons and of daughters, I will give them an
everlasting name that shall not be cut off," Isa. lvi. 5. My soul! when
thou hast answered this inquiry, go on, and make a farther search
concerning "the companions." But what a large door of examination will
open on this ground! The holy Lord himself, in his threefold character
of Persons, has condescended to reveal himself according to the church's
faith in Christ. And every individual believer, even thou, my soul, poor
and worthless, and insignificant as thou art in thyself, yet considered
in relation to Jesus, even thou, in common with all true followers of
Jesus, carriest about with thee evident tokens of the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost. Pause, and determine here again: Are these sacred Persons
companions of thine? Do they walk with thee, and thou with them? Do they
hear thy voice speaking of the love of each, the grace, the mercy, the
goodness of covenant compassion to poor sinners, in and through the rich
salvation of the blood and righteousness of Jesus? But are there not
other companions, even fellow saints and fellow citizens of the
household of God, which may be implied in these words? And do they bear
thy testimony concerning Jesus? Can they witness for thee, that thy lips
drop as the honeycomb concerning thy Lord, and that his name, his love,
his full, free, finished salvation, are the one constant, unceasing
subject of thy whole conversation? Dost thou so speak, so live, and
dwell upon the precious name of thy Lord, and not only talk of Jesus,
but walk with Jesus? And doth Jesus hear thee, and take pleasure in thy
edifying conversation, ministering grace to the bearers? Is a book of
remembrance written before him, concerning those that fear the Lord, and
speak often one to another, and think upon his name? And doth Jesus,
while he graciously looks on and hearkens, bid thee come to him, and
say, "Cause me to hear thy voice?" What! are thy praises of Jesus, and
thy praises to Jesus, pleasant to my Lord? Doth he indeed love to hear
thy poor lisping stammering tongue? If, while I speak to others of my
companions of his blood and righteousness, and of my soul's joy in him,
my adherence to him, my dependence upon him, and my expectation from
him, Jesus not only favours the sweet employment, but bids me come to
him, and tell himself of all that passeth in my heart concerning him;
surely henceforth I will hasten to my Lord, pour out my whole soul
before him, and tell him that he is a thousand times more precious to me
than thousands of gold and silver. Yea, blessed Lord! night and morning,
and seven times a day, will I praise thee, and thou shalt hear my voice.
Witness for me, ye my companions, angels of light, yea, my Lord himself,
if aught but his love and his raise occupy my soul. Thy name, thy love,
thy grace, all, all that belongs to Jesus, shall dwell in my heart, and
wholly fill it; shall hang upon my tongue in endless commendation of his
beauty, and my soul's delight in him. And even in death, may the last
trembling sound the companions gather from my lips be of Jesus, the
altogether lovely, and the chiefest among ten thousand!</p>

12—Morning—Leviticus 25:25</h3>
<p>"If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold."—Levit. xxv. 25.</p>
<p>How poor was I and wretched before I knew Jesus! I had not only sold,
as far as I had power to sell, some of my possession, but all. Indeed,
dear Lord, I could not sell thee, nor my oneness and union with thee;
for that was not saleable, since Christ had from everlasting betrothed
me to himself for ever. But in the Adam nature in which I was born, I
was utterly insolvent, helpless, and ruined: one like the Son of man
redeemed me. But what a double blessedness was it to my soul, when I
discovered that this Redeemer was so very dear of kin to me, that he was
my brother. Hail, thou precious, precious Jesus! thou art indeed, a
"brother born for adversity." Yes, blessed Jesus! thou art he whom thy
brethren shall praise; and all thy Father's children shall bow down to
thee. My soul, see to it that thou make the most of this relationship.
Never, Oh never, will thy brother suffer his poor indigent relation to
want any more, after that he hath thus redeemed both thyself and thy
possession. Now do I see why it was that the church so passionately
longed for Jesus under this tender character. "Oh! (said she) that thou
wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother; when I should
find thee without I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised."</p>

12—Evening—Ruth 4:1</h3>
<p>"Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there. And, behold,
the kinsman of whom Boaz spake, came by; unto whom he said, Ho! such an
one! turn aside; sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."—Ruth
iv. 1.</p>
<p>It is blessed to see, when from general calls in the gospel, the call
becomes personal. The general invitation is, " Ho! every one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters." The personal call is, "Ho! such an
one." Jesus calleth his own sheep by name; how is this done? When at any
time the Lord speaketh by the ministry of his word to their particular
state and circumstances: as for example, when Jesus saith, "I came not
to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Faith saith in
answer, then it is, for me; for I am a sinner. So again when it is said,
" God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us!" Faith replieth, then is that love suited to my case
and circumstances, for I am both by nature and by practice a sinner
before God. So again, when Jesus ascended up on high, he is said to have
received gifts for men: yea, for the rebellious, that the Lord God might
dwell among them. Faith again ends similar encouragement to go upon, in
order to make the thing personal; for the believer saith, I have been a
rebel from the womb. In short, faith always discovers ground to rest for
assurance, when, from general rules, there is found sufficient scope for
special application; and in the suitableness of Christ to the sinner's
necessity, and the suitableness of the sinner for the Redeemer's glory,
the word comes with power to the heart, and with an energy not unlike
the application of the apostle's sermon: "to you is the word of this
salvation sent." For then, like the kinsman of Boaz, the call becomes
personal, changing the appellation from every one, to such an one; and
the believing soul comes at the call, turns aside, and sits down, as the
very one with whom the business is to be transacted. My soul! hast thou
heard the gospel invitation, and found it personal? The answer will not
be far to obtain, if such evidences be discoverable in thyself. Faith is
a precious grace, which never rests until it hath acquired all it stands
in need of as the invitation comes from Christ, so where it is
personally received and accepted, it leads to Christ. Faith is never
satisfied with general views, its whole aim is at personal enjoyments.
There is a selfishness to appropriate and bring home all that is
offered. Salvation is proclaimed from heaven for sinners. God the Father
gives it; God the Son purchaseth it; God the Spirit sends it to the
heart with an "Ho! such an one, turn aside, sit down." See to it, my
soul, that thou hast this personal interest in it, and that Christ is
formed in thy heart the hope of glory.</p>

13—Morning—John 1:38</h3>
<p>"Master! where dwellest thou?"—John i. 38.</p>
<p>Is this the earnest inquiry of my soul? Hear then the answer: "Thus
saith the high and lofty One, whose name is Holy, I dwell in the high
and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones." Pause, my soul. Are these qualities produced by grace in
thine heart? Jesus, Master, make me what thou wouldest have me to be;
and then come, Lord, agreeably to thy promises. Thou hast said, my
Father will come, and I will come, and make our abode with him. And thou
hast said, the Holy Ghost shall come and abide with us for ever. What,
my soul, shall I indeed have such glorious personages for my companions?
Behold, Lord, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain
thee! Oh for grace and a sanctity of thought corresponding to such
mercies, since our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost, which
dwelleth in us!</p>

13—Evening—Genesis 5:24</h3>
<p>"And Enoch walked with God."—Gen. v. 24.</p>
<p>I have often considered, and as often found pleasure in the
consideration of the very honourable testimony which the Holy Ghost hath
given to the faith of the patriarchs, both in the old and new
testaments. What wonders were wrought by faith! "They walked with God!
They endured (saith the sacred writer) as seeing him who is invisible."
They communed with God, and were as conscious of his spiritual presence,
and spiritual society, as we are of sensible objects. Hence, by these
acts of frequent communion, their souls found a growing likeness. The
more they loved God, the more their minds were led by grace into an
increasing confortnity to what they loved. This assimilation is a
natural consequence, even among natural things. He that walketh with
wise men will be wise. We naturary imbibe the manners, the sentiments,
yea, the very habits of those with whom we like to associate. How much
more must a frequent intercourse and communion with the Lord, and under
his spiritual teaching, induce a conformity to the most fair, most
lovely, and most beloved object of the soul! "Beholding (saith the
apostle) as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the
same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." Are
these things so? Then it is explained to thee, my soul, wherefore it is
that thou goest so lean, and art yet so poor in the divine life. Thou
dost not, as Enoch did, keep up a continual communion with Jesus. Pause
this evening, over the subject, and see if this be not the case. All the
days of thine unregeneracy, before thou wert first brought acquainted
with God in Christ, were spent in a total ignorance of God. There was
then no communion with him; yea, not even the desire of communion. But
when God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, shined into
thine heart, then was first given to thee the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. Recollect then, what were
thy feelings when the day-spring from on high first visited thee. Didst
thou not flee to Jesus, as the man-slayer hastening for his life to the
city of refuge? Oh! how feelingly wert thou made to value the very name
of a saviour! How earnestly didst thou seek him above thy necessary
food! And if thou hast since intermitted those visits to Jesus, and lost
a sense of thy daily want of him; can it be a subject of wonder that
this leanness of soul is induced in thee. Will not a distance from, and
a shyness of Jesus produce a poverty in spiritual things, as much as the
want of food to the body will bring on a leanness and a decline in
corporeal things? Learn then, this evening, an unanswerable reply to all
thy complaints, and the complaints of the church at large. Wherefore is
it that believers live so much below their privileges, but because they
live so much below the enjoyment of sweet communion with Jesus? If
worldly concerns swallow up our time, as the earth did Korah and his
company; if we are satisfied with a mere form of prayer in our morning
and evening retirement, and in our family worship before God, while
destitute of the power of godliness; if we are still but little
acquainted with the Lord, and seldom go to court, to behold the King in
his beauty, and to be favoured with his smiles; it is no longer a matter
of surprize, that from keeping so poor an house, we are so poor in
enjoyment. Oh! for grace to walk with God, as Enoch walked! Make me,
thou dear Lord, jealous above all things of my own heart. Let every
morning, with the first dawn of day, call me up to holy communion with
thee. And let every night toll the bell of reflection, to examine what
visits I have had from thee, and what visits I have made to thee; and
let nothing satisfy my soul but the continual walk of faith with thee;
that from an increasing knowledge of thee, increasing communion with
thee, and increasing confidence in thee, my soul may be growing up into
such lively actings of grace upon thy person, blood, and righteousness,
that a daily walk of communion with my Lord, may be gradually preparing
my soul for the everlasting enjoyment of him; and when death comes,
though it make a change of place, yet will it make no change of company;
but "awaking up after thy likeness, I shall be fully satisfied with
it."</p>

14—Morning—I Kings 10:6-7</h3>
<p>"And she said to the king, it was a true report that I heard in mine
own land, of thy acts, and of thy wisdom. Howbeit, I believed not the
words until I Came and mine eyes had seen it: and beheld, the half was
not told me!"—1 Kings x. 6. 7.</p>
<p>If the queen of the South was so astonished in the view of Solomon's
wisdom, what ought to be thy surprize, my soul, in the contemplation of
Jesus, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge! When
thou didst first hear of Jesus, and when constrained by necessity to
come to him, a poor blind ignorant sinner, how little didst thou
conceive either of thyself or him. He told thee indeed, all that was in
thine heart, and made thy very spirit, like her's, to faint within thee,
when he shewed thee thy, sin and his Salvation. Surely then, and often
since, even now, hast thou been constrained to say, as she did, the half
was not told thee by others, of what sweet discoveries he hath made to
thee of himself. Think then, my soul, what holy surprize and joy will
burst in upon thee in the day when, at the fountain-head of glory in his
courts above, he will unfold all his beauty, love, and wisdom; when thou
shalt see him as he is, and know even as thou art known!</p>

14—Evening—Luke 16:20</h3>
<p>"A certain beggar, named Lazarus."—Luke xvi. 20.</p>
<p>What an affecting representation hath the Holy Ghost here made of a
poor, but gracious man! He was not only poor in the mere wants of life,
but exposed in person to great misery; full of bruises, sores, and
griefs. His lot was not to be taken into the house of the rich man, but
to lie at his gate. He had the sorrow to behold every day some pampered
at the tables of the great, caressed and entertained; but for himself,
the crumbs which fell from their over-abundance appear to have been
denied him. At length his sorrows are ended, and death removes him to
the upper world. "The rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he
lifteth up his eyes, being in torments, and beholdeth Abraham afar off,
and Lazarus in his bosom." My soul! this is no parable, but a reality;
and in the general view of it, may serve to teach how very widely we err
in our estimate of men and things. Who that looked on, but would have
concluded that Lazarus was the most miserable of creatures? And who but
would have thought the rich man to have been the most happy? Yet it was
the aggravation of even bell itself, in the torments of the damned, to
behold the felicity of the righteous. Jesus himself hath so marked it:
"There shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth, (saith Christ) when ye
shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the
kingdom of God, and ye yourselves thrust out," Luke xiii. 28. But were
these the principal points our Lord had in view in this representation?
I think not. My soul! turn the whole over again in solemn consideration
this evening, and see whether, in this "certain beggar," there are not
to be discovered features of thy Lord? Though he was rich, yet we know
for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made
rich. Though he was in the form of God, and with him it was no robbery
equal with God, yet he made himself of no reputation, and not merely
humbled himself to the condition of a poor man, and one that had not
where to lay his head, but he humbled himself to the cursed death of the
cross. Was Lazarus poor, full of sores and maladies? And was not Jesus
"the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief?" Who, like the Son of
God, was ever so wounded? Of whom but Jesus could it ever be said, the
Father of mercies, and God of all grace, was pleased to bruise him, and
put him to grief. Did the beggar lie unregarded at the gate? And who can
overlook the neglect and scorn, the cruelty and ill usage exercised upon
the person of Jesus, when he lay at the door of the rich scribes and
pharisees, when arraigned at the bar of Pilate, and when nailed to the
cross? Precious Lord Jesus! thy death closed thy sufferings, and angels
attended thy triumph unto thy kingdom in heaven! Oh! the blessedness of
beholding thee at the right hand of the Majesty on high! Oh! the hell
upon earth in refusing to hear Moses and the prophets, in their
persuasions concerning thee! And what a tremendous, close will it be -
everlasting torments in the hell to come-when thou shalt "come with ten
thousands of thy saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince
all that are ungodly among men, of all their unrighteous deeds which
they have committed, and of all their hard speeches which unregenerate
sinners have spoken against thee!" Then, blessed Lord! every eye shall
see thee, and they also which pierced thee; and all kindreds of the
earth shall wail because of thee. Even so! Amen.</p>

15—Morning—Psalm 116:6</h3>
<p>"I was brought low, and he helped me."—Ps. cxvi. 6.</p>
<p>It is blessed sometimes that the streams of creature comforts should
be dry, in order to compel us to go to the fountain head. When the
fig-tree doth not blossom and the field yields no meat, then a covenant
God is precious to fly to. My soul, say, was not that assault of Satan
sanctified, when it brought Jesus thereby to thy rescue? Was not that
cross sweetly timed, when it tended to wean thee from the world? And
wouldest thou have been without that sickness, when Jesus sat up by
thee, soothed thee in thy languor, and made all thy bed in thy sickness?
Well was it for me that I was brought low, or I should never have known,
in a thousand instances, the help of my God. Oh then, my soul, like
Paul, learn to glory in thy infirmities, that the power of Jesus may
rest upon thee.</p>

15—Evening—Zechariah 16:7</h3>
<p>"At evening-time it shall be light."—Zech. xiv. 7.</p>
<p>Then must it be miraculous; for nothing short of a supernatural work
could produce such an effect. Sunrise at even-tide is contrary to
nature; and the rising of the Sun of righteousness is a work of grace.
Pause then, my soul, over the promise, and see whether such an event
hath taken place in thy circumstances. As every thing in Jesus, and his
salvation, in respect to his church and people, is the sole result of
grace, not nature; so all the Lord's dispensations carry with them the
same evidences. It is even-time in the soul, yea, midnight darkness, ere
first the Lord shines in upon it; it is so in all the after
dispensations, when some more than ordinary manifestation is made; it is
among the blessed methods of grace, when the Lord surprizeth his people
with some rich visits of his love and mercy. "I said, (cried the church,
at a time when the waters of the sanctuary ran low) my way is hidden
from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God." But it is in
creature weakness that Creator strength is manifested; and when we are
most weak in ourselves, then is the time to be most strong in the Lord.
We have a lovely example of this in the case of the patriarch Jacob. His
beloved Joseph was torn in pieces, as the poor patriarch thought, by
wild beasts; a famine compelled him to send his sons into Egypt to buy
corn, and there Simeon, another son was detained; and the governor of
Egypt declared, that until Benjamin, Jacob's youngest son, was sent,
Simeon should not return. Under these discouraging circumstances, the
poor father cried out, "Joseph is not, and Simeon is and will you take
Benjamin also? All these things not, are against me. But the sequel
proved that all these things were for him, and all working out a
deliverance for him and his household, in which the church of Jesus
(which was to be formed from the house of Jacob) should triumph for
ever. "At evening-time it shall be light." The Lord sometimes, and
perhaps not unfrequently, induces darkness, that his light may be more
striking. He hedges up his people's way with thorns, that the almighty
hand, which removes them, may be more plainly seen. Oh! it is blessed to
be brought low, to be surrounded sometimes with difficulties, to see no
way of escape, and all human resources fail, purposely that our
extremity may be the Lord's opportunity, and when we are most low, Jesus
may be most exalted. My soul! is it now even-tide in the soul, as it is
even-tide in the day? Art thou stripped, humbled, convinced of thy
nothingness? Oh! look to all precious, all-suitable Jesus. Hear what the
Lord saith: "When the poor and the needy seek for water, and there is
none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I, the Lord, will hear them;
I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. I will open rivers in dry
places, and fountains in the midst of vallies." "At evening-time it
shall be light."</p>

<p>"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the
people; for the thing was done suddenly."—2 Chron. xxix. 36.</p>
<p>Sweet thought, ever to keep in view, that it is the Lord that
prepares the heart, and gives answers to the tongue. And Oh! how sudden,
how unexpected, how unlooked-for, sometimes, are the visits of his
grace! "Or ever I was aware (saith the church) my soul made me like the
chariots of Amminadab." Is my heart cold, my, mind barren, my frame
lifeless? Do thou, then, dearest Lord, make me to rejoice, in warming my
frozen affection, making fruitful my poor estate, and putting new life
into my soul. All I want is a frame of mind best suited to thy glory.
And what is that? Truly, that when I have nothing, feel nothing, can do
nothing, am worse than nothing, that then, even then, I may be rich in
thee amidst all my own bankruptcy. This, dear Lord, is what I covet. And
if thou withholdest all frames which might melt, or warm, or rejoice my
own feelings; yet if my soul still hangs upon thee notwithstanding all,
as the vessel upon the nail, my God and Jesus will be my rock, that
feels nothing of the ebbings and flowings of the sea around, whatever be
the tide of my fluctuating affections.</p>

16—Evening—Luke 14:16</h3>
<p>"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many."—Luke xiv. 16.</p>
<p>Is not this certain man designed to represent the Father of mercies,
and God of all grace? And is not the great supper intended to set forth
the full, generous, free, and plentiful feast made for poor sinners by
Jesus Christ in his gospel? My soul! thou art invited, for the message
of grace is to the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
Jesus keeps a noble house, and it is an open house. The evening is come
-the hour of supper is arrived: arise then, and accept the invitation.
Behold, Lord, I am come! And now what are the spiritual delicacies of
thy table? First, methinks I hear the generous Lord proclaim a hearty
welcome. And it is a sweet thought for my poor soul to cherish, that in
whatever heart Jesus is welcome, that heart is welcome to Jesus; for as
a poor hungry sinner needs a full Saviour, so a full Saviour needs a
poor empty sinner to give out of his fulness upon, and grace for grace.
Neither is a poor sinner more happy in receiving Jesus, than Jesus is
glorified in receiving a poor sinner. "The Lord waits to be gracious."
And what are the viands at his table? "The kingdom of God is not meat
and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
Here then, I find the whole of the blessed feast. Here is Jesus himself,
the bread of life, and the water of life, whose flesh is meat indeed and
his blood drink indeed. Here are pardon, and mercy, and peace; here is
strength to help in every time of need; all grace treasured up for his
people in himself, and now to be imparted as their several circumstances
require. Moreover, the King himself is to come to his table. I could not
be mistaken in his voice. He saith, "I am come into my garden, my
sister, my spouse. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten
my honeycomb with my honey. I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, 0
friends! drink, yea, drink abundantly, 0 beloved!" What doth our Jesus
mean by "his myrrh with his spices?" Doth he mean the preparing the
souls of his guests for this banquet, by enduing them with the spirit of
repentance and faith? or is it to set before them his own sufferings and
death, "by whose stripes they are healed?" In either sense, blessed be
my bountiful Lord! he is himself the provider; it is his table, and he
himself furnisheth the whole of it. He is the substance, the life, the
ways the means, the end, the first and the last of all; it is all his
own, and of his fulness do we all receive. And, dearest Lord! art thou
pleased with thy guests, when they come at thine invitation, under a
deep sense of want, earnestly desiring to partake of thy bounty,
approaching under the sweet leadings of thy Holy Spirit, and clothed in
the wedding-garment of thine own righteousness? Oh, thou bountiful Lord!
how blessed are they that sit in thine house, they will be continually
praising thee! Now, my soul, thou hast eaten, and art full; arise from
the holy table as one fed and filled with the Spirit; bless the kind
master of the feast, and give thanks, crying out with holy Simeon,
"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."</p>

17—Morning—Song of Solomon 2:9</h3>
<p>"My beloved standeth behind our wall. He looketh, forth at the
windows, shewing himself through the lattice"—Song ii. 9.</p>
<p>It might be truly said, that it was behind the wall of our nature the
Lord Jesus stood, when, by taking a body of flesh, he veiled the glories
of his Godhead, during the days of his humanity. And may it not be as
truly said, that it is still, as from behind a wall, all the gracious
discoveries he now makes of himself are manifested to his people? For
what from the dulness of our perception, the unbelief, and the sins and
infirmities of our nature, the most we see of our Jesus is but as
through a glass darkly. But yet, my soul, how sweet are even these
visits of his love, when we can get though but a glimpse of the King in
his beauty, through the windows of ordinances, or the lattices of his
blessed word. Oh, precious Jesus! let thy visits be frequent,
increasingly lovely, and increasingly glorious, that the souls of thy
people may increasingly delight in thee! Methinks I would lay about the
doors, and windows, and courts of thy house, and be sending in a wish,
and the fervent prayer of a poor beggar who is living on thy bounty,
that thou wouldest come forth to my view and bless me with thy presence,
until that all intervening mediums of wall and windows are thrown down,
and Jesus manifests himself to my longing eyes in all his glory.</p>

17—Evening—Revelation 3:20</h3>
<p>"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice,
and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
with me."—Rev. iii. 20.</p>
<p>See, my soul, what condescension there is in Jesus! It was but on the
last evening that thou wert feasted by his own gracious invitation at
his table; and now the Lord invites himself at thine. So earnest is
Jesus to keep up the closest acquaintance and holy familiarity with his
redeemed, that if they are at any time backward in inviting him, he will
invite himself Jesus is repared for come then this evening, before thou
art prepared for him; yea, not only before thou bast invited him, but
even before thy poor timid and unbelieving heart could, have had the
idea or expectation of such a guest. And hear what the gracious, kind,
affectionate Lord saith. Behold! In which he not only desires to have it
heard and known by thee, but all the church shall know his love in this
particular, and be witnes of his great grace and condescension. And
where is the Lord? "Behold! I stand," he saith, "at the door and knock!"
And wilt thou not, my soul, instantly cry out, as Laban, of old did to
the messenger of Abraham, "Come in thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore
standest thou without?" Oh! the grace that is in the heart of Jesus;
that he, who is the sovereign Lord of all, who hath made us, redeemed
us, bought us with such a price as his blood, should nevertheless stand
without, and beg admittance into the hearts of his people, which he hath
made, and new made, and over whom he hath all power to kill and to make
alive, to heal and to destroy! Precious, precious Jesus! I bless thy
name that I hear thy voice. Thy loud and powerful knocks, by thy word
and by thy Spirit, have made me earnest for thy admission. Put in thine
hand, Lord, by the hole of the door, and open my heart, as thou didst
Lydia's, and give me all-suited grace to receive thee, to embrace thee,
to love thee, to delight in thee, and give thee a most hearty welcome. I
would say, in the warmth and desire of my soul, and in the language of
thine own most sacred words; "Lift up your beads, O ye gates, and be ye
lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in!" And
what hath my Lord promised, when the door of my poor heart is opened?
Yea, thou hast said, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he
with me. Bountiful Lord! wilt thou indeed give me the precious privilege
of an union with thee, and communion with thyself and thy graces? Wilt
thou feed and feast me at my poor house, as on the last night thou didst
at thine own? I have nothing to set before thee; I can bring forth
nothing worthy thy acceptance. But methinks I hear my Lord say, "I am
the bread of life, and the bread of God which cometh down from heaven."
I am all, and provide all, and will give the true relish and enjoyment
for all! Lord, I fall down under a deep sense of my vileness and thy
glory; my emptiness and thine all-sufficiency. Yea, blessed master! be
thou all in all, and let my poor soul feast upon thy fulness; and do
thou "stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick of
love."</p>

18—Morning—John 10:17</h3>
<p>"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life that I
might take it again."—John x. 17.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, the precious cause which thy Jesus here assigns for
the love of his Father. God the Father not only loves God the Son, as
God, one with him in nature and in all divine perfections; but he loves
him peculiarly because he voluntarily undertook and accomplished by his
death the salvation of his people. Now then, my soul, make these two
sweet improvements from what Jesus hath here said. First, think what
must have been, and now is, the love of thy God and Father to thee and
every poor sinner, when he truly love, his dear Son because he became
the Saviour of poor sinners. And, secondly, think what love Jesus hath
shewn to poor sinners in thus manifesting his mercy in such a way, and
how dear they must be to the heart of Jesus, which have made him dear in
the sight of God. My soul, never lose sight of this argument, when thou
goest to the mercy-seat. Tell thy God and Father thou art come to ask
mercies in his name, and for his righteousness' sake, whom the Father
loveth on this very account. And Oh, how very dear should Jesus be to
thee for his blood and righteousness, who is dear to the Father for the
same cause!</p>

18—Evening—Numbers 38: 3-4</h3>
<p>"And thou shalt say unto them, this is the offering made by fire,
which ye shall offer unto the Lord; two lambs of the first year, without
spot, day by day, for a continual burnt-offering. The one lamb shalt
thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at
even."—Numb. xxviii. 3, 4.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over the scriptural account of this solemn
transaction! Think how infinitely important in the sight of Jehovah,
was, and is, that vast sacrifice of the Lamb of God "slain from the
foundation of the world," which every day, morning and evening, the Lord
commanded to be set forth in an offering made by fire. With what
exactness did the church observe this daily rite of oblation! How
scrupulous were all true Israelites in this service! and how fully did
it proclaim to them the doctrine that "without shedding of blood there
was no remission!" Who that reads the solemn precept, and remarks the
strictness of Israel in their obedience to it, but must be struck with
this conviction? And who can for a moment doubt but that the whole was
performed by faith in the Lamb of God, who, in after ages, did away all
the penal effects of sin by the sacrifice of himself? Pause again, my
soul. Hath this daily sacrifice ceased, as the prophet Daniel declared
it should? (Dan. ix. 27.) Are the lamb of the morning and the lamb of
the evening now no more? And wherefore? Because the thing signified
being accomplished, the sign is needed to minister no longer; the
substance being come, the shadow is for ever done away. And shall not
thy morning and thine evening act of faith be expressly exercised upon
this one Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world? Did the
faithful Israelite at nine in the morning, and three in the evening,
(the hours of those daily sacrifices) offer the lamb by faith in the
promised Redeemer; and shall not the believing followers of the blessed
Jesus have their hours of commemoration in spiritual acts of praise and
faith upon the bleeding body of him, who by the one offering of himself,
once offered, hath for ever perfected them that are sanctified? Yes,
thou precious Lamb of God! I would pray for grace to behold thee in
every act of faith, in every offering of prayer, every ordinance, every
means of grace, and all the rites of religious worship. I would see thee
through the whole of the bible as the one thing, the only thing
signified. I would trace the sweet, the blessed, the soul-comforting,
soul-strengthening, soul-transforming subject, until, from the Lamb
Slain from the foundation of the world, I followed the Lamb
whithersoever he went; until I beheld thee, as the beloved apostle saw
thee, "the Lamb as it had been slain, in the midst of the throne," still
wearing on thy glorified body the marks of our redemption. And there,
precious Jesus, should my eyes fix, and my heart centre all her joys,
because also in this exalted state thou art still the Lamb. Thy glory
and thy power have made no change of nature, though of place. Thou art
the Lamb of God, and the brother of thy people still. The eternal
efficacy of thy blood and righteousness, and the everlasting love in
thine heart towards thy redeemed are the same. As in person, so in
office, thou art "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
ever.." Amen.</p>

<p>"As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, destroy it
not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for my servants' sakes, that
I may not destroy them all."—Isa. lxa. 8.</p>
<p>It is blessed to trace our mercies to the fountain head, and to find
them all folded up from everlasting in Jesus. What was it that preserved
our whole nature when blasted and withered by the fall? Was it not
because Jesus, the promised seed, was in it? And what is it that
preserves every individual among the children of God during the dark
season of their unregeneracy, but the same precious cause? He that looks
on (and who is this but Christ himself?) amidst all our perishing
circumstances, by his powerful and all-prevailing intercession, commands
the destroyer not to touch his people; for though in themselves
loathsome, yet in Jesus they are fair and lovely. My soul, learn hence
thy security. The whole cause for which thou wert preserved until
called, and, when called, preserved through grace unto glory, both in
conversion and in every after-act of God's dealings with thee, all
refers itself into this one source. Destroy it not, there is a blessing
in thee, though not from thee: Jesus is in thee, as the new wine is
found in the cluster!</p>

19—Evening—Ephesians 4:30</h3>
<p>"And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption."—Eph. iv. 30.</p>
<p>Methinks I would make this scripture the motto of my daily walk, to
keep in remembrance more than the dearest friend that wears the ring of
love upon his finger, and bears it about with him whithersoever he
goeth. And is the Holy Spirit grieved whenever a child of God forgetteth
Jesus, and by indulgence in any sin, loses sight of those sufferings
which he endured on account of sin? Yes, God the Holy Ghost is grieved,
communion with God the Father is interrupted, and all the agonies and
bloody sweats of Jesus, forgotten, if there be a loose and careless
life. And shall I ever grieve the Holy Ghost by any one allowed
transgression? Would not my soul feel shame at the consciousness of it,
even if no eye but his had seen the foul act? Wouldest thou grieve for
me, 0 Lord, at such a sight? Can it be possible that a poor worm of the
earth, such as I am, should excite such regard and attention? And shall
not the consideration have its constant unceasing influence upon my
soul? Shall I grieve the holy Lord by an unholy conduct? Shall I quench
those sweet influences which first quickened me, and recompense the
kindness, which, had it not been called forth to my spiritual life,
would have left me to this hour as it first found me, dead in trespasses
and sins? Oh! thou holy, blessed, gracious Lord God! withdraw not, I
beseech thee, thy restraining influences; leave me not for a moment to
myself? Thou knowest that I shall grieve thee, if unassisted by thy
grace. Selfwill and confidence, sloth and forgetfulness, pride and
presumption, will afford an opportunity to the great enemy of souls to
betray me into sin, if thou do not keep me; but if thou, Lord, wilt keep
me, I shall be well kept. Thou wilt lead me to the all-precious Jesus,
thou wilt take of his, and so effectually shew it to me, that I shall be
prepared for, guided in, and carried through all acts of holy obedience;
and by thy sweet influences, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, I
shall be enabled to mortify the deeds of the body, so as to live. My
soul! be thou constantly looking to Jesus, seeking communion with the
Holy Ghost, and crying out to God the Father, with David, "Take not
thine Holy Spirit from me;" that I may not grieve that Holy Lord, by
whom I am sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>

<p>"What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to
honour?"—Esther vi. 6.</p>
<p>Nay, my soul, ask thine own heart what shall be done to the God-man
whom Jehovah the King of kings, delighteth to honour? Oh, for the view
of what John saw, and to, hear what John heard, when he beheld the
heaven opened, and heard the innurnerable multitude chanting salvation
to God and the Lamb! Lord, I would say, "let every knee bow before him,
and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father." And Oh, most gracious Father! dost thou take delight that
Jesus should be honoured? Is it thine honour when Jesus is honoured; thy
glory when Jesus is glorified? Oh, what wonderful encouragement is this
to the faith and belief of a poor sinner! that I not only praise my
adorable Redeemer when I come to him for all things, and trust him for
all things; but when also my poverty and emptiness afford occasion to
him to get glory by me, in giving to me all things, and blessing me in
all things. And these exercises of grace are acceptable to God my
Father, as they are honourable to God the Son. And this is the only way,
and a blessed way it is indeed, by which a poor sinner can give glory to
the Father, in believing the record which he hath given of his Son. Here
then, my soul, do thou daily be found in honouring the glory-man, the
God-man, Christ Jesus, whom God the Father delighteth to honour.</p>

20—Evening—Romans 8:23</h3>
<p>"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for
the adoption, to wit the redempton of our body."—Rom. viii. 23.</p>
<p>It is blessed to receive from the Holy Ghost such gracious
interpretations of his own most holy word as bear a correspondence with
what we feel in a life of grace. We know that our adorable Jesus is the
Saviour of the body as well as the soul; but we know also that these
vile bodies of ours are not regenerated, as the souls of his redeemed
are. In this tabernacle, therefore, we groan, being burdened. "I know,"
saith Paul, "that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing."
And I too often know, to my sorrow, the same. Pause, my soul, this
evening, over this solemn scripture, and look up to the great author of
it, to unfold its sacred truth to thy comfort. I hope I can humbly adopt
the language, and say, that I "have the first fruits of the Spirit." I
know what it is to enjoy the first dawnings and readings of grace. I
know what it is to have been once afar off, living without God and
Christ in the world, an enemy to God by wicked works. And I know what it
is to have been brought nigh by the blood of Christ Jesus, by his Holy
Spirit, hath come nigh to me, and brought my soul nigh to God. I know
also what it is at times to have sweet seasons of communion. I am as
sensible of the reviving, comforting, strengthening, refreshing graces
of the Spirit, as the earth is of the falling showers, or the sweet
return of light. I know no less what it is to have an enlargement of
soul, in the, going forth of the exercises of faith and grace upon the
person and work of the Lord Jesus. When the Redeemer is pleased to call
forth into lively actings upon himself the graces he hath planted, I can
then find a blessed season in contemplating his glories, his beauties,
his fulness, his suitableness, and all-sufficiency. I then sit down as
the church of old did, "under his shadow with great delight, and his
fruit is sweet to my taste." The Lord hath then "brought me into his
banqueting house," and my whole soul, under his banner of love, is
delighted in fatness. But amidst these "first fruits of the Spirit,"
these blessed earnests and pledges of the glory that shall be revealed,
I know no less also what it is to groan within myself, waiting for the
adoption, to wit, the redemption of my poor polluted, sinful body. I
find this partner of my heart, this earthly half of myself, at times the
greatest opposer of my better dispositions. "The flesh lusteth against
the Spirit;" the soul is straitened, shut up, so as to say nothing, and
do nothing, when appearing before the Lord. I dare not neglect prayer; I
dare not absent myself from going to court! The king will know and and
mark my neglect. But if I go, I am cold, dead, lifeless: I hear as
though I heard not; I pray as though I prayed not. Can I do otherwise
than groan? Can I help at times being deeply affected, although I have
the first fruits of the Spirit?" Lord Jesus, undertake for me, and let
all the sanctified blessings, intended by thy love and wisdom to be
derived from these painful exercises of the soul, be accomplished. Let
this thorn in the flesh make me humble: root out the very existence of
spiritual pride; reconcile my whole heart to the humiliation of the
grave; and, above all, endear thee, thou precious Immanuel, the Lord our
righteousness, more and more to my affections, since it, is thou, and
thou alone, that canst be our peace here and our salvation for ever!</p>

21—Morning—Genesis 2:20</h3>
<p>"But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."—Gen. ii.
20.</p>
<p>My soul, mark what is here said, for sure it is a sweet scripture.
Amidst all the works of God, "there was not one that could be found an
help meet for man." The inferior creatures could indeed minister to his
bodily comfort, but not to his soul. Eve herself, with all her
loveliness, must have failed in this particular. Both the woman and her
husband alike needed this help to the soul. How refreshing is the
thought, and what a lovely view doth it give us of God's grace and
mercy, that in the seed of the woman an help, in the fullest sense of
the word, was found both for time and eternity. Jesus in our nature
needed the church for his partner: and the church needed Jesus, and he
was, and is, the very Adam of whom our first father in nature, was but
the shadow, and Christ the substance. Yes, blessed Jesus! in thee we
trace this wondrous gift of God. Pause then, my soul, and add this
thought to the vast account: The same love which fitted thee with an
help meet in a Saviour, hath fitted thee, and will continue to fit thee,
with the supply of all thy need. It were to be wished, that every child
of God would never lose sight of this certain truth-that he must have
the fittest station in life, the fittest frame of mind and of body, the
fittest yoke-fellow, the fittest circumstances; in short, the fittest
mercies and the fittest trials; because every thing is made subservient
to the divine glory in Jesus. Sweet thought! "He that spared not his own
Son, will with him also freely give us all things."</p>

21—Evening—2 Corinthians 11:23</h3>
<p>"In deaths oft."—2 Cor. xi. 23.</p>
<p>What did the apostle mean by this expression, but that from living in
Christ, he was always on the lookout for dying in Christ; so that death
could make no change of state, whatever change it made of worlds; for
that living or dying, he was still in Christ? Paul seems to be speaking
out his whole soul in the thought. It seems as if the conscious sense of
his union and interest with Jesus was so inwrought in his very nature,
that he was "in deaths oft," hoping that this providence, or that
appointment, would be found the messenger to call him home to his
Redeemer, to be with him for ever. My soul!, as every night the bed of
sleep to thy wearied body becomes a representation of the night of
death, and the chamber of the grave, sit down this evening, and look
over the memorandums of thine heart, whether there are some of the same
sweet testimonies, and arising out of the same blessed source, as the
apostle's, thou art "in deaths oft," and canst protest, as be did, by
the rejoicing which thou hast in Christ Jesus, that "thou diest daily?"
- If the apostle's state is thine, the habitual frame of thine heart,
from a well-grounded interest in Jesus, must be such as to leave a
constant impression on thy mind, that the change of death, come when it
may, and coming, as it must, from thy Lords own appointment, must be to
thy happy account. It is to die and be with Christ, which is far better.
Here we live, we walk, we enjoy Jesus, but by faith; there we shall ever
be with the Lord; we shall see him as be is, we shall be like him. As
here Jesus imparts all the grace the souls of his redeemed need in life
to carry them on, and bring them home, so there he imparts glory: as he
shines in one glorious fulness as the sun, so they as the stars of
heaven for multitude and brightness. He that is the source and fountain
of all grace in this fife, is the source also of glory and happiness in
the world to come. If then, my soul, thou art "in deaths oft," as one on
the look-out for the coming of thy friend to call thee home to himself,
is not the prospect delightful? Wouldest thou shrink back, if his
chariot-wheels were now at the door? - Pause. Are you daily pleading his
blood and righteousness before God? Are you most firmly, and most
satisfactorily convinced of his conquest over sin, death, hell, and the
grave? Do you heartily, cordially, fully approve of God's rich covenant
mercy in Christ? Can you, do you, will you take God at his word, and
give him the credit due to him, in believing the record which he hath
given of his dear Son? And are you living daily upon these precious,
blessed things, and under his grace, determined to die in the faith of
them? What sayest thou to these solemn, but precious soul-transactions?
Can a throne of grace witness for thee, that thou art constantly
pleading them there, as the only means, the only security thou art
looking to for thy acceptance? If so, and should the messenger of Jesus
come, and find you upon your knees, would you say, not yet, Lord? Would
any thing make you linger here, when Jesus stood above, calling to thee,
'Come up hither?' Oh! dearest Jesus, for more of that grace, for more of
that faith, to overcome all fears, doubts, and misgivings. Oh! for some
sweet increasing manifestations from thyself, dear Lord, day by day,
that the nearer I am drawing to the period of my departure, the closer I
may cling to thy embraces, and the more sensibly I may hang my soul upon
thee; that when death comes thou mayest impart such strength to my poor
dying frame, that like the patriarch I may cry out: "Into thine arms,
Lord Jesus, do I commit my spirit; for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord,
thou God of truth!</p>

22—Morning—Isaiah 14:20</h3>
<p>"They shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he shall
send them a Saviour, and a great one, and he shall, deliver them."—Isa.
xix. 20.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, the sweet encouragement contained in these words. Here
is a cry, and it is the cry of the soul; for it is directed unto the
Lord. There is (as Elihu tells us) a cry of nature under oppression; but
as this is not to God, it is evident that it never came from God; for he
tells us, that none of them saith, "Where is God my Maker, who giveth
songs in the night?" Job xxv. 9. But when the Holy Ghost convinceth of
sin, and puts a cry in the heart by reason of it, he convinceth also of
the righteousness of Jesus. Hence the difference of those cries is as
wide as the east is from the west. Mark, therefore, my soul, this
distinguishing feature of grace, and see whether thy cries are praying
cries, and not complaining ones. And now observe what follows. When poor
sinners thus cry unto the Lord, "he shall send them a Saviour, and a
great one." Who but God the Father, sent his Son to be the Saviour of
poor lost sinners? Was not Jesus a Saviour indeed, and a great one! Who,
but he, could deliver the sinner from destruction? And remark further,
the absolute certainty of the promise; for it is said, "he shall deliver
them." Yes, blessed Jesus, thy deliverance is sure, thy salvation
certain. Thou hast said, thy "sheep shall never perish, neither shall
any pluck them out of thine hand." Pause, now, my soul, over this sweet
verse. Surely in its bosom is folded up the sum and substance of all the
gospel. Here are all the Persons of the Godhead engaged for the
salvation of every poor crying sinner. Here is God the Holy Ghost,
agreeably to his blessed office, causing the sinner to feel the
oppressions of sin, and putting a cry in his heart to the Lord, to be
delivered from them. Here is God the Father, answering that cry in
mercy, and sending his almighty Son to be the Saviour of the poor
sinner. And here is Jesus the Saviour, and a great one, saving the poor
sinner with an everlasting salvation. Shout then, my soul, and begin the
song of salvation to God and the Lamb!</p>

22—Evening—Jeremiah 30:21</h3>
<p>"And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall
proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and
he shall approach unto me; for who is this that engaged his heart to
approach unto me? saith the Lord."—Jer. xxx. 21.</p>
<p>When the patriarch Jacob was dying, he pronounced, under the spirit
of prophecy, that "the sceptre should not depart from Judah, nor a
lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come," Gen. xlix. 10. And
here in the prospect of the Babylonish captivity, now on the eve of its
arrival, the prophet is commissioned by the Lord to tell the church,
that notwithstandidg all present appearances, no foreigners should judge
or rule over them; but one should proceed from the midst of them, to be
their governor, even David their king, whom I (saith Jehovah, verse 9.)
will raise up unto them. One like unto themselves, such as our Jesus
was, like unto his brethren. Sweet confirmation of our faith! And that
no doubt might arise concerning the justness of the application, the
Lord by another prophet (Micah v. 2.) mentioned the place of his birth,
and marked at the same time, the features of his eternal power and
Godbead. "But thou, Bethlehem-Epbratah, though thou be little among the
thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is
to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from
everlasting." But we must not stop here in our views of this precious
scripture. He that is to come forth from among his brethren as their
governor, Jehovah engageth for him, that be will cause him to approach
unto him. Blessed thought! No son or daughter of Adam could ever have
drawn nigh to God, but for this gracious interposition. The holiness of
the divine nature, the holiness of the divine law, and the enmity of the
heart of man by sin, totally precluded it. None but he who is holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the
heavens, could have engaged his heart to this service. And indeed he
graciously undertook it, and as completely accomplished it. Jesus was
peculiarly suited for this vast undertaking. For as God he was one with
the Father, to whom he approached; and as man, he was the person for
whom, and by whom the reconciliation was to be accomplished; and as both
God and Man in one Person, he could (as Job calls it) be a proper
Day's-man, to act between both parties, and restore to God his glory,
and to man his happiness. And what a blessed addition to these
delightful things respecting Jesus, is it to see, that God the Fathers
hand was with Jesus in all! "I will cause him to draw near, and he shall
approach unto me." Pause, my soul over this blessed scripture, and
behold in all the vast work of thy Redeemer's salvation, the name and
authority of God thy Father confirming it. And wilt thou not then, in
all thy approaches to God in Christ, have respect to this sovereign act
of Jehovah? Is it indeed God the Father who hath given his dear Son,
called him, appointed him, solemnly introduced him into his high
priest's office, by an oath, and in all his offices as Mediator, caused
him to draw near in the accomplishment of redemption: and wilt thou not
in an thy approaches, look unto Jesus as the Father hath respect unto
him? Oh! for grace, in all the lively exercises of it, to draw nigh to
the footstool of the mercy-seat, and unceasingly to remind God our
Father of his own gracious appointment and acceptance of the church in
the person of his dear Son. Yea! holy Father, I would say, in every act
of worship, love, and praise, "Behold, O God, our shield, and look upon
the face of thine anointed!"</p>

23—Morning—Romans 5:21</h3>
<p>"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord."—Rom.
v. 21.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, and put forth thy fullest thoughts in the
contemplation of those two united sources of thy felicity, marked in
this verse: the Father's eternal purpose, in the reign of grace; and the
everlasting efficacy and infinite value of thy Jesus's righteousness, to
eternal life. None but God himself can know the fulness and extent of
either. I am persuaded, that angels of light can never entertain
adequate conceptions of either. The eternal purpose of God hath bounded
the reign of sin; it is but unto death. But those purposes give a
further extent to the redemption from death and sin, by Jesus; for the
glory of Christ's person, and the worth of his salvation, possess in
both a vast overplus, a redundancy of merit, which brings the redeemed
into favour and acceptance in Jesus, and with such a title to
everlasting felicity, as eternity itself can never exhaust- no, nor
fully recompense nor pay. Oh for grace to contemplate the love of the
Father, and of the Son, by this standard; and the love of God the Holy
Ghost, through whose gracious influence we enjoy both. Lord, I would be
lost, I would be swallowed up, day by day, in the unceasing meditation!
Dearest, blessed, precious Jesus! give me to think of nothing else, to
speak of nothing else; but by faith to possess in anticipation, the joys
of thy redeemed, until I come, through thee, and in thee, to the
everlasting enjoyment of them, in thy kingdom of glory.</p>

23—Evening—Mark 16:9</h3>
<p>"Now when Jesus was risen early, the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, put of whom he had cast seven
devils."—Mark xvi. 9.</p>
<p>My Lord! I have often found occasion to stand amazed at the wonders
of thy grace, as set forth in thy blessed word. Every thing manifests
that it is altogether free and undeserved; nothing, in the objects of
it, having the least tendency to call it forth into exercise; no, not
even our misery: for though our misery afforded an opportunity for the
greater display of it, yet thy grace was long before our misery,
originating as it did in thine own everlasting love. Every circumstance
connected with the manifestation of thy grace calls forth astonishment.
The greatness, the continuance, the unceasing nature of it,
notwithstanding all the undeservings of the objects of thy rich bounty;
all tend to excite astonishment in my soul. But, Lord! when at an time I
behold abounding grace shewn, where there have been abounding
transgressions ; and, as the apostle expresseth it, "where sin hath
reigned unto death, that there more eminently grace should reign unto
eternal life;" my soul is overwhelmed in the contemplation; for here I
discover, as upon numberless other occasions, that "thy thoughts are not
my thoughts, nor thy ways my ways." Will Jesus, this evening, graciously
tell me, why the poor Mary Magdalene was first blessed, before any of
the disciples, with the sight of her risen Saviour? Was it to teach her,
and all poor:sinners like her, that "where sin hath abounded, grace
shall much more abound?' Was it indeed to encourage every poor
broken-hearted sinner, long exercised with the power and temptations of
Satan, that it is to such more especially that Jesus hath an eye, that
he knows their sorrows, and will assuredly relieve them? Did my honoured
Lord mean, by this wonderful act of grace, to shew that he will take yet
delight to inhabit that I precious soul out of which more he hath cast
seven devils, than where legions of evil spirits have not been, suffered
so long, and so powerfully to triumph? Am I, blessed Lord, authorized by
this gracious act of thine, so to construe thy wonderful love? Shall a
poor Magdalene, who only ventured, while thou wast upon earth, to fall
at thy feet, behind thee, weeping, be first blessed with a sight of thy
Person after redemption-work was finished, before the beloved apostle
who lay in thy bosom at thy table? Oh! thou dear, thou gracious thou
condescending Lord! what am I to interpret of this kind act of thine,
but that the heart of Jesus yearns over poor sinners, and can and will
administer consolation to them in their most desperate circumstances?
Yes! thou dear Lord! such hath been thy mercy, love, and grace, in every
act. Rebellious angels are passed by, and fallen man calls forth thy
pity! And among men, thy grace is shewn, not to the wise, and noble, and
self-sufficient; but to the poor, the needy, the maimed, the, halt, the
blind. Yea, Lord! thy grace is frequently manifested to tempers the most
unpromising, to stubborn and rebellious persons; whilst those who are
wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own conceit, starched in
the ceremonies and forms of religion, live, and it is to be feared die,
without the knowledge of salvation by Jesus. Hence the young man in the
gospel, who thought himself from his own goodness just ripe for heaven,
shall go from thee sorrowful, while Jesus will take up his abode in the
heart of a Magdalene, which had before been occupied by seven devils!
Oh! for grace "to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth and
length, and depth and height; and to know the love of Christ, which
passeth knowledge, that I may be filled with all the fulness of
God."</p>

24—Morning—Zechariah 3:1-2</h3>
<p>"And he shewed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel
of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the
Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that
hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee. Is not this a brand plucked out of
the fire?"—Zech. iii. 1, 2.</p>
<p>Who shall say, how many such transactions as these are continually
going on, for and against the people of God, in the court of heaven,
while we upon earth are unconscious either of our misery or mercy? The
Holy Ghost was graciously pleased to have this made known to the church.
And John was again directed to tell the church, that a song in heaven
was sung at the expulsion of the devil from heaven, because the accuser
of the brethren was cast down. My soul, doth he that first tempts thee,
then become thine accuser? Is he carrying on this practice day and night
before God? And while Satan is thine accuser, is Jesus thine advocate?
Oh precious, precious Lord! how little hath my poor ignorant and
unthinking soul been meditating on thee, in this thy merciful, sweet,
and gracious office. Oh glorious thought! Now I see a blessedness in
that scripture which I have often read with indifference in times past;
"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous; and he is (for God my Father hath set him forth so) the
propitiation for our sins." Hail, holy, wonderful Counsellor!
condescend, thou mighty Pleader, still to take up my cause! Oh may I
behold thee often in this high office! Oh may I often hear thee with the
ear of faith, and my whole soul going forth in love towards thee, while
thou art pointing to my poor soul, and saying, "Hath not God the Father
chosen this brand plucked from the fire? Take away the filthy garments
from him. I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee."</p>

24—Evening—Colossians 1:24</h3>
<p>"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake,
which is the church."—Col. i. 24.</p>
<p>What can the apostle mean from these expressions? Not, surely, that
the sufferings of Jesus were incomplete, or that the sufferings of his
people were to make up a deficiency: for in treading the wine-press of
the wrath of God against sin, Jesus trod it alone, and of the people
there was none with him. And so perfectly finished and complete was the
whole work of redemption by Jesus, that by the one offering of himself,
once offered, "he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." But
what a sweet scripture is this of the apostle's, when it is interpreted
with reference to Jesus, that in all the sufferings of his people Jesus
takes a part! Jesus suffered in his own person fully and completely,
when as an expiatory sacrifice for sin he died, the just for the unjust,
to bring his people to God. These sufferings as a sacrifice were full,
and have fully satisfied: they cease for ever, and can be known no more.
But the sympathy of Jesus with his people gives him to bear a part in
all their concern. And the consciousness of this made the apostle tell
the church that he rejoiced in all his exercises, because Jesus took
part, and thereby endeared the affliction. My soul! cherish the thought
also. Thy Jesus knows all, measures out all, bears part with thee in
all, and will carry thee through all, and finally crown all with his
love and blessing. The same interest that Jesus felt in the persecution
of Saul over his afflicted ones, when he called from heaven to restrain
Saul's rage, and said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"—the same
interest he feels in every minute event, with which his redeemed are
exercised now. "Whosoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye."
Blessed Lord! may my soul keep in remembrance those endearing views of
thy love. Give me to keep alive the recollection of the oneness between
the glorious head, and all his exercised members. I see that a child of
thine cannot mourn, but Jesus marks it down, and puts the tears in his
bottle. He notes his sorrows in his book. So that by this
fellow-feeling, Lord! our interest in thee is most fully proved. And
while thy people partake in thy righteousness, thou takest part in their
sorrows. As it was in the days of thy flesh, so is it now in the fulness
of thy glory: "in all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel
of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
them, and he bare them and carried them all the days of old."</p>

25—Morning—1 Timothy 1:15</h3>
<p>"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."—1 Tim. i, 15.</p>
<p>Hearken, my soul, to the proclamation from heaven! Is this the
faithful saying of a faithful God? Surely, then, thou mayest well regard
it, for it is for thy life. And if it be worthy of all acceptation, it
must be eminently so of thine; for thou hast been a transgressor from
the womb. But did Jesus indeed come to save sinners? Yes, so the
proclamation runs. Sinners, enemies to God. Jesus, it is said, "received
gifts for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them;" and
with that tenderness which distinguished his character, he said himself,
that he "came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Well, then, my soul, up on this warrant of the faithful word of a
faithful God, wilt thou not so fully rely as to believe unto salvation?
If any inquiries arise contrary to this belief, let this be thine
answer: - Christ came to save sinners; that is enough for me; for I am
one. God's salvation is said to be for enemies; that is my name by
nature. Jesus received gifts for the rebellious; to this character I
plead also guilty. If men or devils would endeavour to work unbelief in
my heart, this is my answer: - Christ came to save sinners." Let those
that never felt sin, and consequently know not the need of a Saviour,
stay and argue the point as they may; my souls eternal welfare is
concerned, and I will not lose a moment to close with the heavenly
proposal. Lord Jesus, thou waitest to be gracious! The faithful saying
of my God I accept on my bended knees. It is indeed worthy of all
acceptation, and above all, of mine. Here while upon earth will I
proclaim thy praise; and in heaven, the loudest of all voices must be
mine, that Christ came to save Sinners, of whom I am chief."</p>

25—Evening—Song of Solomon 2:3</h3>
<p>"As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
among the sons."—Song ii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul! if the church found so much blessedness in making
comparisons between her Lord and any of the beautiful objects of nature
around her; see if thou canst raise a subject for thy meditation, this
evening, from the statement she hath made in this lovely verse. Why
should not Jesus be in thy view as in her's? Doth he not infinitely
transcend all sons, of whatever description or character that can be
found? Angels, no doubt, by creation may be called "the sons of God;"
and when God had finished the works of his hands, we are told that "the
morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy."
But Jesus as far excels all angels of light, as the apple-tree the trees
of the Wood: for "he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name
than they." Neither did God at any time say unto the angels, "Sit thou
on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool." But to our
Jesus he said, "Thy throne, O God I is for ever and ever, a sceptre of
righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom." And to shew at once the
infinite superiority of the Lord Jesus, when he bringeth in the first
begotten into the would, he saith, "And let all the angels of God
worship him." Therefore if by the term sons, it could be supposed that
angels are meant, well might the church declare Jesus her beloved, to be
above them. And if by sons, the sons of men be meant, what is the whole
church of saints compared to Jesus? Though the church, by the comeliness
her Lord hath put upon her, shines like a beautiful constellation among
the heavenly bodies, yet all her glory and lustre are derived from
Jesus, the Sun of righteousness. Pause, my soul, over this view of thy
Lord. And when thou hast feasted thyself with the sweet subject, go on,
and mark some of the many beauties contained in this comparison between
the apple-tree and the trees of the wood. In our cold country, the
apple-tree, in its best appearance, affords but a poor resemblance, to
what naturalists relate of the pomecitron, as it is called, of the warm
eastern climates. It is said of the appletree of those countries, that
it is a lofty, majestic, stately tree, abundantly fruitful, and yielding
both shade and fruit to the traveller. Some assert that it continues
bearing fruit the whole year, and is never without blossom. If so,
without going farther, we may discover enough by which to understand the
beautiful allusion the church hath made of it in this verse to her Lord.
Jesus is all this, and infinitely more. He is indeed the tree of life in
the midst of the paradise of God, and he bears fruit every month, and
the leaves of this tree are for the healing of the nations. Precious
Jesus! thou art the fairest and the chiefest among ten thousand! Be thou
to me, Lord, as the fruitful bough which the dying patriarch blessed by
the well, whose branches ran over the wall. And Oh! do thou give
strength to my poor feeble faith, to gather all the rich fruits of thy
righteousness for the healing of my soul, that I may daily sit down
under thy shadow with great delight, and thy fruit be sweet to my
taste!</p>

<p>"And they said one to another, did not our heart burn within us,
while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?"—Luke xxiv. 32.</p>
<p>Ought not the disciples of Jesus to do now, as the disciples of Jesus
did then? What but of Jesus should we speak of by the way? Methinks the
Lord's people, and especially when coming from the Lord's house, should
be distinguished from the frothy conversation of mere carnal
worshippers. I would, by talking of Jesus, invite him to mingle with us,
and open to our understandings the scriptures. I would therefore
sometimes ask one and another, when returning from the house or the
table of the Lord, how went the matter with your soul to-day? I pray you
tell me; was the King at court? Did he receive petitions? Did he answer
prayers? Were you refreshed? were any healed? any comforted? any made
joyful in his house of prayer? Surely we might hope, by such edifying
inquiries, each would help his fellow. And he of whom it is said the
Lord hearkened and heard, when of old the people of God were often
talking one to another, would again draw nigh, and make the heart burn
with the sweet manifestations of his love. But chiefly, blessed master!
if I meet with none to ask whether they have seen the King in his
beauty, give me to taste of the sweet savour of thy grace myself. Come
to me, Lord, in the refreshing, strengthening, heartwarming,
soul-rejoicing manifestations of thy presence; for thy love is better
than wine, and the very crumb from under thy table is more delicious
than the honey and the honeycomb.</p>

26—Evening—Acts 4:13</h3>
<p>"And they took knowledge of them, that they had been with
Jesus."—Acts iv. 13.</p>
<p>Oh! for the same grace to rest upon me, as upon those faithful
servants of my Lord; that, like them, I may manifest the sweet savour of
Jesus's name in every place; wherever I am, with whomsoever I converse,
in every state, and upon every occasion, that all may witness for me,
and every thing bear witness to me, that I have been with Jesus! I would
entreat thee, my honoured Lord, that I may honour thee so before men,
that after my morning visits to thy throne of grace, my mid-day
communion, my evening and nightly fellowship, my return to the society
of men might so be distinguished as one that had just been with Jesus.
And as it might be supposed, if an angel was to come from heaven that
had seen thy face, and heard thy voice, and been an eye witness of thy
glory; so, Lord, having by faith enjoyed such views, I might delight to
tell, as He would relate to the inhabitants of the earth, the grace, and
beauty; and love of Jesus. And surely, Lord, if I have been with thee,
and thou with me; if I know any thing of thy grace and salvation; will
not, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speak? Shall I not
delight to tell every one I meet what my Lord is in himself, and what he
is to his people? Shall I not speak with rapture of the glories of thy
Person, and the infinite value and worth of thy blood and righteousness?
Surely in the circle of my acquaintance, I shall be daily speaking of
thy grace and salvation, for I know no end thereof. And especially in a
day like the present, where the name of my Lord and his cross are
banished from all conversation. Oh! that it may be shewn that I have
been with Jesus, in speaking for Jesus. Yes! thou dear Lord! thy truths
I would espouse, thy doctrines profess, salvation alone by thy
righteousness and cross would I bear before a whole world, with
earnestness and with zeal; and if this brought upon me the laugh and
derision, yea, the persecution of the proud; like thy servants of old,
"I would rejoice in being counted worthy to suffer shame for thy name."
And chiefly, and above all, let it not only be noticed that I have been
with Jesus, in speaking of Christ and for Christ; but let the sweet
unction of thy Holy Spirit be so abiding upon me, from continual
intercourse and communion with thee, that my whole life and conversation
may be such as becometh the gospel of Christ. Oh! for the same blessed
effect as Moses, whose face shone when he came down from the holy mount,
that every one with whom I have to do may see the light of thy grace, in
all my transactions with the world, so shine before men, that they may
glorify my Father which is in heaven. Precious Lord! grant me these
unanswerable testimonies of vital godliness; then will it be proved
indeed and in truth, that, like thy servants of old, I have been with
Jesus.</p>

27—Morning—John 16:14</h3>
<p>"He shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it
unto you."—John xvi. 14.</p>
<p>Some precious souls are at a loss to apprehend how the Holy Ghost
makes application of Jesus and his benefits to his people. Hence they
ask, how am I to know that the righteousness of Jesus, and the blood of
Jesus, are applied to me. But be not thou, my soul, ignorant of so
important a matter, on the clear apprehension of which thy daily comfort
depends. Attend, my soul, to what thy Jesus saith in those precious
words; and, under the blessed Spirit's teaching, the matter will appear
abundantly plain. He shall glorify me, saith Jesus. And doth not the
Holy Ghost do this in every believer's view, when he gives the soul to
see that all that vast extent of redemption-blessings which the Father
treasured up in his dear Son for poor sinners, flow immediately from
Jesus? And observe, the Holy Ghost doth not at first shew the sinner
that all result from the everlasting love, and grace, and purpose of God
the Father; but he leads the sinner to view them, and receive them, as
the blessed fruits and effects of Jesus mediation; and then opens more
fully the glory of the Father in the original design of them, in this
precious way, from everlasting. This is needed to glorify Jesus, and to
glorify the Father in him. And how are these blessings applied? The
scriptural answer is the best answer:—"He shall receive of mine," saith
Jesus, "and shew it unto you." And doth not that almighty Teacher do all
this most sweetly and effectually, when at any time he so holds up the
Lord Jesus, in all the glories of his person, and in all the beauties of
his finished work, as to incline the sinner's heart so to behold the
Saviour as to believe in him, and firmly to rely upon him? Is not the
righteousness of Jesus received, and his precious blood applied, when
the soul is led to the hearty and cordial assurance that that
righteousness is effectual to justify, and that blood to cleanse from
all sin? Yes, precious Jesus! I praise thee for these blessings in thee.
I adore thee, thou Holy Spirit, for thy divine teaching concerning them;
and I glorify thee, thou Almighty Father, for thine abundant grace and
mercy in the gift of thy dear Son.</p>

27—Evening—Revelation 19:12</h3>
<p>"And on his head were many crowns."—Rev. xix. 12.</p>
<p>Every view of Jesus is blessed. But there are some views which the
heart of a believer finds a peculiar gratification in contemplating. The
Holy Ghost hath in this scripture given a very interesting
representation of Jesus. Heaven is opened; Jesus appears in his
well-known characters, "faithful and true." A "white horse" he rides on,
to manifest his equity and justice. His vesture is "dipped in blood," to
intimate that by blood he hath purchased his kingdom. And his glorious
name, "the Word of God," is also mentioned to testify the greatness and
almightiness of his person. But amidst these distinguishing
characteristics, the coronation of the Lord Jesus is particularly
striking. "On his head were many crowns." The crown of Godhead is his by
right, in common with the Father. And the crown of God-man mediator is
his also, being his by gift, by purchase, and by conquest. Having
conquered death, hell, and the grave, God the Father hath set "a crown
of pure gold upon his head." "For his honour is great in his salvation;
glory and majesty hath he laid upon him." But there is another crown put
upon the head of our Jesus, and which every poor believing soul
delighteth to see, amidst the many crowns on the head of Jesus; namely,
the very crown which that poor precious believer puts by faith upon the
glorious head of Jesus, I when ascribing his own personal salvation to
the alone merits of his blood and righteousness. This is a coronation
day indeed of the Lord Jesus; and ever after, most blessed to the review
of every believer. And as the Son of God was crowned "Lord of all," in
the day when he ascended to the right hand of his Father in heaven,
having finished redemption's work, when the whole assembly of heaven
cast their crowns at his feet; so is the adorable Redeemer again
crowned, when, descending in the power of his Spirit, he takes the
throne of a poor sinners heart, and rules and reigns there, the Lord of
life and glory. My soul! pause and ask thine heart what knowest thou of
this coronation? Amidst the many crowns discoverable upon the head of
the blessed Jesus, canst thou with rapture discern the one, the very
one, he wears as thy Redeemer and Lord? It is very easy to discover it,
if thine hand of faith hath placed it there. Art thou his subject? "Know
ye not," saith the apostle, "to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or
of obedience unto righteousness Hast thou been translated out of
darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son? Is Jesus thy King, as the
acknowledged and adored head of the church, which is his body? And art
thou living upon him, and from him, as this glorious head, from whence
is conveyed to thee, in common with all his members, life, light, grace,
strength, and every thing in a way of communion, by which thou provest
that thou art among the members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
bones; and be the glorious source and fulness that filleth all in all?
These are precious views and soul-comforting evidences to this grand
truth. And if these be found in thy experience, then art thou so
beholding him, on whose head are, many crowns, as to venture all thy
salvation wholly upon him, and every renewed act of faith is but a
renewal of thy coronation of the Lord Jesus: for in every one thou
bowest the knee of thine heart before him, and confessest that "Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."</p>

28—Morning—2 Corinthians 6:10</h3>
<p>"As having nothing, and yet possessing all things."—2 Cor. vi.
10.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou learnt this holy science? There are three blessed
lessons the Holy Ghost teacheth on this ground. As, first, the believer
is thoroughly emptied of himself. Art thou thus taught of God? Hast thou
been led to see, to feel, to know, to be convinced that, after all thine
attainments, after all thy long standing in the school of Jesus, thou
hast nothing, canst do nothing, art worse than nothing, and, literally,
hast no more in thyself now to recommend thee to Jesus, than the first
moment thou didst hear of his name? This is to have nothing; this is to
be poor in spirit. Secondly , dost thou possess all things in Jesus?
Yes, if so be thou art living out of thyself wholly upon him; and how is
this known? Nothing more evident. When a sense of my emptiness endears
to me his fulness; my poverty, his riches; my weakness, his strength; my
sins, his righteousness; my guilt, his blood; I truly possess all
things, as far as I improve what Jesus is to his people, and rest upon
him and the blessed fruits of his salvation, as God the Father designed
him, who hath made him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
redemption to his people. And there is a third precious lesson the Holy
Ghost teacheth to the poor that have nothing, and yet possess all
things; namely, so to possess Jesus himself that he may not only make
his poor ones rich in his riches, but be himself their treasure; so to
supply them not only with what they need, but to be himself their
fulness; not on to open to them light and life, but to be himself both
their light and life; so to impart to them salvation as to shew them
that he is himself their salvation; and, in short, so to give them
present peace, and the assurance of everlasting happiness in his blood
and righteousness, as to give them the perfect enjoyment that he is
himself both their present and everlasting happiness and their portion
for ever. My soul, hast thou learnt, and art thou ever day more and more
learning, these precious truths? Oh, then, look up to thy Jesus, and say
with one of old, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon
earth I desire besides thee. My flesh and my heart faileth; but thou art
the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever."</p>

28—Evening—Isaiah 47:8</h3>
<p>"I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
transgressor from the womb."—Isa. xlviii. 8.</p>
<p>Humbling as the view is, it is profitable to look back, and trace all
the way the Lord our God hath brought us, through many a year in the
wilderness, to humble us, and to prove us, and to shew us what is in our
heart; and this perhaps is the sweetest of all subjects, when the Holy
Ghost takes us by the hand, and leads the heart back. Even from the
first moment of conversion, to the very moment when taking the review,
every step serves to prove what this scripture sets forth, that the Lord
knew that his people would deal very treacherously, and be transgressors
from the womb. My soul! let thy meditation, this evening, as it concerns
thyself be to this amount: Where wert thou, when in a state of
unawakened nature, and as all other carnal persons, intent only upon the
best means of fulfilling to the desires of the flesh; living without
God, and without Christ in, the world; a child of wrath, deserving wrath
even as others? The Lord, who knew this, and also what undeservings
would follow, still was pleased to visit thee with his great salvation.
He manifested the riches of his grace in calling thee, justifying thee,
adopting thee into his family, and putting thee among his sons: and he
gave thee the Spirit of his Son in thine heart, whereby thou wert
enabled to cry, "Abba, Father." And what hath it been since, but the
same rich display of free and unmerited mercy? Doth he not know, that
thou art still a transgressor? Doth he not continually wait to be
gracious, when thy unthinking wandering heart is forgetful of him? Doth
Jesus withhold or suspend his grace, and the manifestations of his
favour, because thou art forgetful of him? Oh! not so. He deals by thee,
as he did by Israel of old! When Israel remembered not the multitude of
his mercies, but were disobedient at the sea, yea, even at the Red Sea,
nevertheless, it is said, "he saved them for his name's sake," that he
might make his mighty power to be known. So doth thy Jesus deal by thee.
Though thou art a transgressor from the womb;" yet Jesus is Jesus still.
The covenant promises of God the Father are the same; and the efficacy
of Jesus's blood and righteousness the same: therefore Jesus deals by
thee, not according to thy deserts, but according to his own free and
sovereign grace. His love, and not thy merit, becomes the standard of
his dealings with his people. Oh! how blessed is it to trace mercies to
their fountain-head, and to behold God in Christ, dispensing pardon,
love, and favour, from his own free and sovereign will and pleasure; and
every renewed mercy carrying with it this divine signature: "Not for
your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be
ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel."</p>

29—Morning—Exodus 21:5-6</h3>
<p>"If the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my
children, I will not go out free. Then his master shall bring him unto
the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door posts;
and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall
serve him for ever."—Exod. xxi. 5, 6.</p>
<p>How sweet is scripture explained by scripture! Jesus saith, when
sacrifice and offering under the law were both unprofitable, "Mine ears
hast thou opened;" or, as it might have been rendered, "Mine ears hast
thou digged." Ps. xl. 6. And elsewhere, "The Lord God hath opened mine
ear, and I was not rebellious." Isa. l, 5. The apostle to the Hebrews
decidedly explains this in reference to Christ, Heb. x. 5. And what was
all this but to shew the voluntary service of Jesus to the office and
work of the Redeemer. Was not Jesus, in all that high work, the servant
of Jehovah? Though he was in the form of God, and with him it was no
robbery to be equal with God, yet he made himself of no reputation, and
took upon him the form of a servant. And for whom did he this? Was it
not, in effect, saying, like the jewish servant, which was typical of
him, "I love my master, my father, in the work of redemption?" John xiv.
31. "I love my wife, my church, my spouse." Song iv. 10. "I love my
children: behold I, and the children thou hast given me." Isa. viii. 18.
"I will not go out free." Oh, precious Lord Jesus! well might the
apostle say, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the
church, and gave himself for it!" Surely it was thy love, dearest Lord,
to thy church, that moved thee to serve Jehovah, "as Israel served for a
wife, and for a wife kept sheep." Hosea xii. 12. Oh for grace to love
thee, and to serve thee for ever!</p>

29—Evening—John 16:13</h3>
<p>"He shall not speak of himself."—John xvi. 13.</p>
<p>I have found, in time past, a very great blessedness in this short
but sweet account, which Jesus gives of the gracious office of the Holy
Ghost; and therefore I would make it the subject of my present evening
meditation. I find what the Lord Jesus said concerning the blessed
Spirit, in this most delightful part of his divine ministry, to be true.
For look wherever I may, through the bible, it is of Jesus only the Holy
Ghost is continually speaking, and not of himself. And hence, by the
way, I learn how to form a most decided testimony of the faithful
preachers of the word. For, if God the Holy Ghost, in his glorifying the
Lord Jesus, is never found to be speaking but of Jesus; surely all his
faithful servants, who act by his authority, and are commissioned and
ordained by him to the work, will never preach themselves, but Christ
Jesus the Lord. And how blessed is it to be taught of Jesus, by the Holy
Ghost! It is astonishing, when we take into one mass of particulars the
agency of the Holy Ghost in his glorifying the Lord Jesus, to observe
the patience, the compassion, the tenderness, and love, which that
blessed Spirit manifests to the church of Jesus, in holding up to their
view, and in bringing home to their heart, the person, work, character
and relations of Jesus! How sweetly and effectually doth he speak of
him, plead for him, and win over the affections to him, by his saving
light, his illuminating grace, and persuasive arguments in the heart! It
is the Holy Ghost that takes of Christ, and the things of Christ, and
makes both appear lovely and desirable in our eyes. It is his blessed
work to bring about the gracious union, when, as the bridegroom of his
church, God the Spirit represents him in his beauty, and persuades the
soul of the sinner to receive him and accept him as her Maker and her
husband, to whom she is betrothed for ever! And from whom, but the Holy
Ghost, do those sweet influences arise from day to day, and from one
degree of grace to another, by which the life of the believer in Christ
is kept up, maintained, and carried on in the soul, from the first
beginning of the spiritual life, until grace is consummated in eternal
glory. Oh! Lord the Spirit! I beseech thee, glorify my adorable Redeemer
in my poor cold and lifeless heart, and sweetly lead over the whole of
my affections to all-precious Jesus, that I may live upon his glorious
person, and feel my interest in his great salvation increasingly
precious. And Oh, thou holy Lord! keep alive, I beseech thee, thine own
saving and powerful influences in my heart, that I may never, never by
sin, quench thy divine flame, nor "grieve the Holy Spirit, whereby I am
sealed unto the day of redemption."</p>

30—Morning—Ephesians 2:7</h3>
<p>"That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
grace, in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus."—Eph. ii 7.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, and gather in all the powers of arithmetic, and try
if thou art able to count what the exceeding riches of God's grace
amount to. Think how great, how free, how sovereign, how inexhaustible,
how everlasting! All that a poor sinner hath in time, all that we can
enjoy to all eternity, all is of grace. And what a title hath thy God
chosen to be known by among his people, when, to make himself known more
fully in Jesus, he styles himself "the God of all grace!" All grace?
Yes, all grace, and all sorts and degrees of grace: pardoning grace,
renewing grace, quickening grace, strengthening grace, comforting grace;
in short, all grace. And is all this treasured up in Jesus? Oh then, my
soul, see that Jesus be thine, and all is thine. And mark this down as a
sure unerring rule-as grace hath no source but in the Father's love, so
the exalting that grace, in Jesus is the Father's design in salvation.
The brightest pearl in the Redeemer's crown is that which shines with
this inscription: "To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he
hath made us accepted in the beloved. "Here, my soul, seek thy daily
grace more earnestly than thy daily bread.</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

30—Evening—Psalm 45:2</h3>
<p>"Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy
lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.—"Ps. xlv. 2.</p>
<p>I admire this blessed portion, as well as the method in which the
sacred writer hath introduced it. He opens the psalm, professing his
design of speaking of the King: but in a moment, as if bebolding him, he
breaks off, and speaks to him. The verse now quoted contains but three
short sentences: but indeed within its bosom, there are folded up as
many volumes. For who so fair, so lovely, so engaging, as Jesus? "He is
the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his
person:' and if all the accomplishments and perfections which can
constitute excellency, be among the recommendations of beauty and
loveliness; then it will be found, that in the person of Jesus they all
centre and shine in one full constellation. Well might the prophet
therefore speak of him in this character: for he is a perfection of
loveliness. Every thing in him is lovely, nor can there be, any
loveliness but what is derived from him. "Thou art comely, (saith Jesus
to the church), from the comeliness that I have put upon thee." My soul!
never lose sight of this view of thy Jesus. And let it be everlastingly
impressed upon thy mind, that whatever is fair, or amiable, or lovely,
in the church of Jesus, or in, any individual member of it, ordinances,
or means,of grace, all are so only as beheld in him. Nothing can endear
or recommend them to God, but as they are accepted in Him, the beloved.
This is the first volume of beauty contained in the bosom of this verse
of scripture. And the second is like onto it. For, next to the glory of
Christ's person, we are called upon to admire the glories of his work
and office. "Grace is poured into grace in his heart only, his lips."
Not a fulness of or in the purity and holiness of his nature: but it is
"poured into his lips," to give out to his people. And no wonder,
therefore, that the church, under this view of her Lord, cried out with
an earnestness of holy longings and desires, "Let him kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth," as if conscious, that by those means, grace would
be communicated in fulness and abundance. Let those who know the
blessedness of these communications, explain the justness of the
church's breathings for those tokens of the love of Christ; for such
only can fully explain their meaning. But, my soul, do thou judge for
thyself, whether thou hast so tasted of the Lord's graciousness, from
the fulness "poured into his lips," as to have received those frequent
manifestations of his love. There is one word more in this delightful
verse to be noticed, and which indeed gives a finishing beauty to the
whole, namely, "God hath blessed him for ever." Yes, Jesus, as the
glorious Head and Mediator, is blessed for ever, and is Jehovah's
salvation to the ends of the earth. "Men shall be blessed in him," is
the sovereign decree, and "all nations shall call him blessed." My soul!
behold what a blessed subject for endless delight, the Holy Ghost hath
opened to thee, in this one short verse of scripture. Take it with thee
to thy bed; let it lie down with thee, and arise with thee; for it will
give thee songs in the night, and under the Holy Spirit's teaching, it
will so open to thy view the glories of thy Jesus, as to make thy
constant "meditation of him sweet."</p>

31—Morning—John 11:56</h3>
<p>"What, think ye that he will not come to the feast?"—John xi. 56.</p>
<p>Is this thy inquiry, my soul, when at any time thou art seeking Jesus
in his word, in his ordinances, at his table? Will be not come? Will
Jesus not be there? Think how, he hath dealt in times past. Did not
Jesus rejoice when the hour arrived for coming into the world for
salvation? Doth he not rejoice, when coming to the heart of the poor
sinner for conversion? and will he not come with joy in all the renewed
visits of his love? Besides, doth not Jesus know that it is a time of
need to thee? And hath he not opened a way to the throne of grace, on
purpose that his poor helpless children might come boldly to a throne of
grace to obtain help, and find grace in every time of need? Oh then,
mark it down as a sure thing, thy Jesus will be there. He spreads the
feast, and he will be present, He waits to be gracious; waits to be kind
to thee. Love is in his heart, and salvation in his hands. Hasten then
to his house, to his table, to his bosom, to his heart; and say, with
the church, "Come, my beloved, and be thou like a roe, or a young hart,
upon the mountains of Bether."</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

31—Evening—Ezekiel 1:26</h3>
<p>And above the firmament, that was over their heads, was the likeness
of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stones and upon the
likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above
upon it."—Ezek. i, 26.</p>
<p>It forms the most satisfying consideration to the breast of the
faithful that every event and every providence concerning the people of
God is as much directed, arranged, and determined, as the purpose of
redemption themselves. The covenant is "a covenant ordered in all things
and sure." He who hath undertaken and completed salvation for them, hath
no less secured the means that shall infallibly accomplish the end; and
all things, how unpromising soever on the first view, shall work
together for good to them that love God. When the Holy Ghost would
graciously lead the church into the proper apprehension of this great
truth, the prophet is directed to the contemplation of a vision by the
river Chebar, which opened before him. There were living creatures
moving in a straight direction upon wheel, wheels within wheel, attended
with a noise and a voice; hereby intimating, as it should seem, that the
government of every thing, in the kingdom of providence and grace, was
regulated by an unerring standard; in the kingdom and that the prophet's
mind might farther understand the vision, he was led to see above the
whole, "the likeness of a throne, and the appearance of the likeness of
a man upon it." Nothing could be more gracious, by way of teaching the
church that the government of all things is in the hand of Jesus, and
the most minute circumstance of his people subject to his controul.
Amidst numberless improvements to be made of this doctrine, there is
one, my soul, which, in the exercises of thy warfare, thou wilt find
perpetual occasion to apply; for what can be more blessed than to
contemplate this government of thy Jesus, as continually exercised in
his sin-preventing providences, whereby the Lord keeps back his people
from presumptuous transgressions? How often, how very often, might a
child of God discover those sweet restraints of the Lord, when he is at
any time hedging up his way with thorns, that he may not find his paths?
How often hath some outward affliction, or inward sorrow sickness in
ourselves, or death in our houses, acted in a way of prevention to this
end? There are a great variety of ways, by which the remains of
indwelling corruption would manifest themselves, and break forth in
their several disorders, but for restraining grace. What a beautiful
instance was that of David, in the case of Nabal, and what a gracious
sentitnent to this amount the psalmist expressed upon it! When Abigail
came, in the seasonable moment to check his anger, David discerned the
divine hand in the appointment, and brake out in a devout
acknowledgment: "Blessed be the Lord, and blessed be thy advice, and
blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from shedding blood," I Sam.
xxv. 32. And who shall say, amidst the ten thousand occurrences of life,
what multitudes of instances to the same purport are going on, to
restrain the children of God from the commission of evil? Oh! how
blessed it is to view Jesus as well in providence as grace, and, like
the prophet, to keep an eye to that throne, and to see one like the Son
of man sitting upon it, regulating and ordering all things for his own
glory, and the salvation of his people. Precious Jesus! keep me in the
hour, and from the power of temptation. Do thou order my steps by thy
word, so shall no iniquity have dominion over me.</p>

1—Morning—Matthew 1:23</h3>
<p>"And they shall call his name Emanuel, which, being interpreted, is
God with us."—Matt. i. 23.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou never remarked what a peculiar beauty and
sweetness there is in every name by which thy God and Saviour is made
known to thee in his holy word? Surely, if nothing more had been
intended by it, than to identify and prove his sacred person, one name
would have answered this purpose: evidently, therefore, somewhat of
great importance is designed from his many names. And depend upon it, my
soul, so much loveliness is there in every individual name of thy Jesus;
and at one time or other, in thy walk of faith, so very much wilt thou
need every one, and find the preciousnes of every one, that thou
wouldest not part with one of thy Redeemer's names—no, not for the
world. This of Emanuel, by which thou art commanded to call him, is a
sweet one to endear him to thee. Had he not been Emanuel, he could not
have been Jesus, for none but God can save a sinner: and therefore he is
called Emanuel, which signifies, "God with us." Hence, therefore, he is
God. Put this down as a glorious truth in thy esteem. God in our nature:
God tabernacling in our flesh. God in us; and God in our hearts, the
hope of glory. It is the Godhead of thy Jesus which gives efficacy and
value to every act of redemption. As God, his righteousness is the
righteousness of God to justify thee. Mark that! his sacrifice to
atone—his blood to cleanse—his grace to bless. All these blessed acts of
thy Jesus derive efficacy to answer all their glorious purposes, because
they are the acts of God. And remark, my soul, yet further, that all
that yet remains to be fulfilled, in what he hath in now pleading thy
promised concerning salvation, in now pleading thy cause, and hereafter
taking thee to glory; these cannot fail—because he who hath promised is
Emauel. Go on, my soul, one step futher, and remember that He, whom thou
art to call Emanuel, is also God in thy nature. Hense he is so very near
and dear, in all tender alliances, as to be bone of thy bone, and flesh
of thy flesh. My soul, never, never lose sight of this most sweet and
precious name of thy Jesus. Call him as thou art commanded, call his
name Emanuel.</p>

1—Evening—Zechariah 12:8</h3>
<p>In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
he that is feeble among them at that day, shall be as David; and the
house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before
them."—Zech. xii. 8.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! in the calculation of times and seasons,
thou art entering this day upon a new month; stand still and consider
what progress thou art making in the spiritual path. Here is a sweet
promise for the gospel dispensation. It is an old testament promise to
be fulfilled in a new testament day. The weak and feeble, in our
spiritual David, being really and truly </span><span class="c6">in
David, </span><span class="c5">shall be as David, that is, strong in the
grace and strength that are in Christ Jesus. And the whole house of
David, every true believer in Jesus, shall be as Jesus; that is, so
accounted before God, as one in Christ, and accepted in him the beloved;
for in the eye of God, and of his holy law, they are one and the same.
But what a sad consideration is it, that the progress in the divine
life, here set forth, is so seldom sought after by the people of God! We
are, for the most part, satisfied to have made our calling and election
sure, and do not seem to feel it much at heart, that frequently the soul
goes lean, and is feeble in spiritual attainments. My soul! let me
impress it upon thy most serious consideration, this evening, how
needful it is to have this sweet promise brought home, and proved in thy
daily experience. Is not Jesus, in his person, work, and righteousness
to be continually improved in soul-acquaintance and communion? Should I
not seek to preserve a constant communication with my Lord? Whenever I
consider his fulness, which is all for his people, surely I ought to
send forth a desire for a renewed token of his love. And yet when I come
to sit down in the evening, and to look back upon what hath passed
between my Lord and me, through the day, alas! how little hath my soul
been going forth in desires after him, and in enjoying communion with
him! Come, blessed Jesus! come I pray thee, and let my awakened
faculties be exercised upon thy person, blood, and righteousness, until
this sweet promise be mine, and I find my feebleness becoming strength
in my Lord. Let the growing acquaintance with thee, of one day, be made
the step for desiring greater knowledge, and greater enjoyment of thee,
for the next day; and let my earnest soul be pressing after fresh
discoveries of thee, and for sweet manifestations from thee every day,
in greater frequency, and in more enlarged views of thy glory. Oh! for
grace from my Lord, for the liveliest actings of faith, and love, and
praise, and every longing desire upon and towards him whose name is;
"the Lord our righteousnes;" that the grace and good-will, the mercy and
kindness of God my Saviour, may be my daily song, and evening delight,
in this house of my pilgrimage!</span></p>

2—Morning—Luke 7:44</h3>
<p>"Seest thou this woman?"—Luke vii. 44.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, look at this woman at the feet of Jesus;
for thy Jesus bids thee look, and gather instruction from the view, as
well as the pharisee. Behold how she wept, how she washed the feet of
Jesus, and anointed them with ointment. These were sweet tokens of her
love and adoration. But were these the causes for which she obtained
forgivings? Oh, no. Read what the Lord said to her: "Thy faith hath
saved thee." Learn, then, my, soul, in what salvation lies. Love may
bring ointment to Jesus. Sorrow for sin, when grace is in the heart,
will cause tears to fall. But faith brings nothing, for it hath nothing:
it casts itself wholly upon Jesus. Amidst all its guilt, and fears, and
tears, it is Jesus only to whom faith looks; it is Jesus upon whom alone
it depends. It hath nothing to do with self; neither our own feelings,
nor the exercise of our graces. These are blessed </span><span
class="c6">evidences</span><span class="c5"> of the work of the Lord
upon the heart; but they are not, salvation. It is Jesus, all precious,
all glorious, all suitable Jesus! He is the One blessed object of
faith's joy and hope, and pursuit and desire. And, depend upon it, thy
God and Father in Christ Jesus, is more pleased, more honoured, by this
simple act of faith upon Jesus glorious person and righteousness, than
by all the tears in the world; when those tears lead us to place a
stress upon the </span><span class="c6">effects</span><span class="c5">
of faith, instead of hanging wholly upon the </span><span
class="c6">cause,</span><span class="c5"> in the glorious object, Jesus.
Pause, my soul, over this nice but proper distinction; and this will be
to find comfort always in Jesus, "Seest thou this woman?"</span></p>

2—Evening—John 3:12</h3>
<p>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
believe if I tell you of heavenly things?"—John iii. 12.</p>
<p>Was there ever condescension like that of Jesus, to accommodate
himself to the dull and senseless capacities of his people? Kind,
compassionate, indulgent Teacher, I would say, how shall I sufficiently
admire or adore thy love? Oh! that a consciousness of my ignorance would
endear to me thy wisdom! And Oh! that a sense of the deep things of God
would induce in me a temper and frame of mind suited to the docility and
humbleness of a weaned child! Now, my soul! mark from these words of thy
Jesus to that master in Israel, Nicodemus, that so sublime are the
wonders of redemption, even in that part of it which is connected with
earthly things, that our capacities, until opened and fitted for the
apprehension of divine truths by grace, cannot enter into the enjoyment
or belief of them. And how then shall the glories of eternity, which are
reserved for unfolding on the other side of Jordan, be brought within
the grasp of our intellect? And yet there are some, yea, many, who with
the incredulity of Thomas, refuse conviction, unless they receive what,
in the present state of things, cannot be granted. Blessed Master, I
desire to praise thee for that proportion of faith thou bast given me,
to "believe the things which are freely given to me of God;" and I
beseech thee, Lord, to grant me increasing proportions of faith and
grace, that I may both believe the earthly things of salvation, and the
heavenly things to be revealed. I would pray for grace and faith in
lively exercise, to connect and bring into the same view, both worlds,
as they concern thee and thy great salvation. Yea, Lord, I would pray
for increasing knowledge of, and delight in all the great things of
salvation, among the transactions of earth here below; such as the
momentous truths of regeneration, justification by thy blood and
righteousness, and the eternal acceptance of thy people in thee, and in
thee only, the beloved. And I would pray also for the most enlarged and
enlarging views of faith, concerning the glories which shall be
revealed, which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered
into the heart of man to conceive." Lord, increase my faith, and prepare
me for the everlasting enjoyment of thyself in glory, when faith "shall
be swallowed up in sight; when I shall see thee as thou art, and know
even as I am known."</p>

<p>"Who loved me, and gave himself for me."—Gal. ii. 20.</p>
<p>See, my soul, how Paul is for ever using Jesus, and feasting for ever
upon him. Oh! seek grace to do the same. He saith, Jesus loved him;
Jesus, the Son of God, loved Paul. Now love from any object is valuable,
but from the first, and best, and greatest of all Beings, what
invaluable love is this? And who did Christ love? "Why me," saith Paul:
"who was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious." And how do you
know, Paul, that Jesus loved you? " He gave himself for me," saith Paul.
"Gave himself?" Yes, himself. Not his gifts only, not his grace, not his
mercies, though all creation is his. And whatever he gave must have been
an undeserved mercy; for I merited hell, when he bestowed upon me
heaven. But even heaven, with all its glories, is nothing, saith Paul,
to what Jesus gave me; for he gave "himself for me." Oh! my soul, wilt
thou not look up, wilt thou not be encouraged to hope, to believe, to
hang upon Jesus, for the same. Oh! for faith to believe. Precious Jesus!
thou author and finisher of faith, grant me this mercy! And while I read
these sweet words concerning thee, who loved and who gave thyself for
poor lost sinners-Oh! like Paul, and with the same assurance of faith,
cause me to add—me, me: Jesus "loved me, and gave himself for me."</p>

3—Evening—Psalm 49:7-8</h3>
<p>"None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a
ransom for him. (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it
ceaseth for ever.)"—Psalm xlix. 7,8.</p>
<p>How very striking is the former of these verses! And Oh! how justly
true! If it were possible for the rich worldling to keep back from the
grave, by purchase, his worldly friend, would he do it? Yes,indeed, it
is possible he might, under the presumption, that when it came to his
turn, he should himself be redeemed. It is, however, of little
consequence to estimate human friendship, when they are altogether
helpless in the most important of all concerns. But, my soul, doth not
this scripture point to him, and tend to endear him to thy warmest
affections, who was indeed "a brother born for adversity;" and who,
"though rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that through his poverty we
might be made rich?" Jesus was, and is, the brother (mentioned in that
scripture, Lev. xxv. 25.) who, when our whole nature was waxen poor, and
we had sold our possession, and had no power to redeem it, came and
proved his—relationship by ransoming our lost inheritance.</p>
<p><span class="c5">But mark, my soul, what is said in the latter of
these verses; "the redemption of their soul is precious." Precious
indeed! since none but Christ could redeem it; and he only by his blood;
yea, not his blood only, but his soul. For it was expressly agreed upon,
and so the tenor of the everlasting covenant ran when thou shalt make
his soul an offering for sin," (Isa. liii. 10.) then "he should see his
seed." But remark yet further, that this latter verse is enclosed in
parenthesis. I have often thought wherefore the Holy Ghost was pleased
so to enclose it? Not surely, that, like other parenthesis, it might be
read or left out; not so, I venture to believe. But rather, I should
conceive, that hereby its total unconnection with what was said before
of the rich worldling having no power to redeem his brother, the
preciousness of Christ's redemption might be more strikingly
conspicuous. And so it doth indeed. And how precious, blessed Jesus,
was' and is, thy redemption! Not purchased with corruptible things, as
of silver and gold, and therefore not liable to perish and become
corruptible like them. And being so richly purchased, and so fully and
completely bought with a full value, and infinitely more than value,
even with the soul of Christ, it ceaseth for ever. It is impossible ever
to need again redemption, for it is impossible ever more to be lost. Oh!
precious salvation! Oh! precious, precious, Redeemer!</span></p>

4—Morning—Lamentations 1:16</h3>
<p>"The Comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me."—Lam. i.
16.</p>
<p>Whence is it, my soul, that those distressing thoughts arise? Pause,
and inquire. Is the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, indeed withdrawn, when
Jesus, thy Jesus, sweetly and graciously promised that he should abide
for ever? This cannot be. Is the righteousness of Jesus less; or hath
his blood to atone and cleanse, lost its efficacy? Oh no! Jesus'
righteousness, and Jesus' all-atoning propitiation, like the almighty
Author of both, must be eternally and everlastingly the same;
"yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." Hath God thy Father forgotten to
be gracious? Oh no! God thy Father proclaimed from heaven that he is
well pleased for his dear Son's righteousness' sake; and never, never,
shall a word gone out of the Lord's mouth be altered. From whence then,
my soul, is thy leanness, thy fears, and despondency? Canst thou not
discover? Oh yes! It is all in thyself, and thy unbelieving frame; thou
art looking to thyself, and not to all-precious Jesus! Thou wantest to
feel some new frame of thy own; some melting of heart, or the like; and
if thou couldest be gratified in this, then thou wouldest go to Jesus
with confidence, and then plead as thou thinkest, Jesus' name, and
blood, and righteousness for acceptance. And doth the want of these
feelings keep thee back? Oh, fie! my soul, is this thy love, thy
kindness to thy friend? Can any thing be more plain, than that thou art
making a part saviour of thy feelings, and not a whole Saviour of thy
Jesus? No wonder thou criest out, "the Comforter is far from me;" for
the Holy Ghost will teach thee, that all comfort is only in Jesus. And
mark this, my soul, for all future occasions. - If thou wilt seek
comfort in any thing out of Jesus, though it be in the sweetest frames,
as thou mayest think of thine, Jesus, in mercy and love, will put thy
comforts out of thy reach. Oh then, come to Jesus, poor and needy, with
or without frames. Make him all, and in all; and be will be thy joy, thy
comfort, and thy portion for ever!</p>

4—Evening—Luke 3:23</h3>
<p>"And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age."—Luke iii.
23.</p>
<p>How marvellous in all things are the ways of God to us! Was Jesus
indeed in the world, and the world made by him, and the world knew him
not? And did he remain hid away, and unknown for the first thirty years
of his life? Did the Son of God come on earth to do away sin by the
sacrifice of himself, and yet enter not upon the full purpose of his
mission until so large a portion of his life upon earth had passed away?
Oh! wonder-working God! how true it is, that thy ways are not our ways,
nor thy thoughts our thoughts! Yet,my soul, though thy Jesus did not
engage in his public ministry, in the more open display of it by his
miracles and preaching, yet surely those thirty years were of vast
importance on the score of redemption. No doubt Jesus spent them in
obedience to his Father's law, manifesting a life of holiness and
purity, suited and corresponding to the immaculate perfection of his
nature, "who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth."
Convinced as I am, my honoured Lord, that the body which thy Father gave
thee, and the human nature which thou didst assume for the purpose of
salvation, was not produced in the ordinary method of generation, but by
the miraculous influence of the Holy Ghost, so am I equally convinced
that during the whole of thy life, from the manger to the cross, every
act, hnd word, and thought of thine, manifested that thou wast holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
heavens. And shall I not also believe, that these thirty years were of
some sweet, though to us secret importance, in thy covenant engagements
as our surety? Can I suppose, that the thirty years of my Redeemer's
life, before his being publicly made known to Israel, were spent in
doing nothing with relation to the great work which he came purposely to
do? Did not those seasons minister also to the cancelling the sin of his
people, taking away the curse by bearing it, and by dying for it; and
may we not suppose that God the Father had an eye to every minute act in
the life of his dear Son, whom he had called to the work of salvation;
and given as a covenant to his people, to be their head and mediator;
their law-fulfiler and sin offering? Precious Lord! silent as the
scriptures are on this great portion of thy life, yet is not their
silence a call upon thy people to meditate on the subject? Give me
grace, then, my honoured Lord, to be often contemplating the infinite
condescension of Jesus in this part, as well as in others, in which thou
must have endured such a contradiction of sinners against thyself." And
let not this be the smallest improvement of this sweet and interesting
view of my Lord, that when I call to mind how thy holy soul must have
felt, during the thirty years, from the open displays of sin, in the
blasphemies and daring defiances of God, the reproaches of the ungodly,
and the torrent of evil all around; yet nothing stopped the gracious
purposes of thine heart, in executing the errand on which thy whole mind
was bent, "in dying, the just for the unjust, to bring sinners unto
God!"</p>

5—Morning—Galatians 3:19</h3>
<p>"In the hand of a Mediator."—Gal. iii. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> The hand of a Mediator was the great blessing
every, enlightened son of Adam, from the fall, sighed after, and looked
for, in every approach to God. Hence the first transgressor, for the
want of it, bid himself from the presence of God, amidst the trees of
the garden. Hence Israel cried out to Moses, "Go thou near, and hear all
that the Lord our God shall say; but let not God speak with us, lest we
die." And Job longed for a day's man, that is, a Mediator, that might
lay his hand upon both parties. See then, my soul, thy privileges; for
thou hast a Mediator, and a glorious one indeed, in whose almighty hand
all thy concerns are eternally secured. "Ye are come," saith the
apostle; he doth not say, ye are </span><span
class="c6">coming.</span><span class="c5"> but, ye are </span><span
class="c6">come,</span><span class="c5"> to Jesus, the Mediator of the
new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling." Oh then, in all thy
approaches, have an eye to Jesus. Put all thine affairs into this
glorious, Mediator's hand. Remember, he wears thy nature, pleads thy
cause, takes up all thy concerns, and ever liveth to make intercession
for sinners; and therefore, cast all thy care upon him, for he careth
for thee. And look to this one grand thing that all thy confidence, and
all thy joy, ariseth wholly from Jesus' person and righteousness; not
from any supposed graces, tears, repentance—nor even from faith itself,
if viewed as an act of thine. Cast aside, as filthy rags, all that is
thine; and never, no not for a moment, look at any thing as a procuring
cause; but let Jesus have all thy confidence, all the glory, and thou
wilt have all the comfort. Though Satan accuse, though conscience pleads
guilty, God's broken law pronounceth condemnation, and justice demands
the penalty, Jesus hath answered all, and is on the throne to see the
issue. Oh, the blessedness of having all in the bands of a
Mediator!</span></p>

<p>"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son. And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
be is the Son of Man."—John v. 22, 27.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Here, my soul! here is a sweet and blessed portion
to take with thee, night by night, as a sleeping draught, to lie down
with in holy composure; or if thou lie watchful, to give thee songs in
the night. Everynight is a new watchword of the night of death; and none
can tell thee when thou droppest asleep, whether, in the next opening of
thine eyes, thou mayest not open them in eternity, and find thyself
standing before the judgrnent-seat of Christ! Dost thou not wish to be
prepared for such an event, and not to leave so infinitely momentous a
concern to a peradventure? Read then, again and again, this sweet
scripture. I take for granted, that thou knowest Jesus; and art
acquainted, yea, savingly acquainted with his glorious person, as thy
surety; and the merits of his blood and righteousness, as thy salvation
I see then what this blessed scripture saith, that all judgment is
committed unto thy Jesus, because he is the Son of man. Mark that, my
soul! not because he is the Son of God; for in that case, judgment could
not have been </span><span class="c6">committed </span><span
class="c5">to him; for it was his before, in common with the Father and
the Holy Ghost; the whole Three Persons constituting the one eternal
Jehovah. But judgment is committed to Christ, and is peculiarly his,
because he is the Son of man." Cherish the sweet, the soul-transporting,
the soul-supporting truth. Thy Jesus, who is now thy surety, is then to
be thy Judge. He that hath died for thy sins, is then to be thy
advocate. And he that hath paid the ransom with his blood in this life,
is then to see the reward of it in another. Now then behold where alone
thy confidence is to be found. Bring forward to thy view the solenin,
the awful day. Realize it, as if the archangel's trumpet were now
sounding, and thou beheld Jesus coming to be glorified in his saints,
and admired in all that believe. Let others, who now boast of their good
works, and hope allowance will be made for human frailty, and the like;
or all that troop of half disciples, who partly to Christ, and partly to
themselves, look for salvation; let such do as they will; there is but
this one thing left for thee to do, and this one thing well done, will
do for all; remember, Jesus is thy Judge; and all judgment is committed
unto him, "because he is the Son of man." Humbly, my soul, but with the
boldness of faith through his blood, draw near to his gracious seat; and
against all law charges, and the divine demands of justice, hold up the
blessed testament of Jesus's blood. Here, Lord, I would say, are the
Father's promises of redemption, in thy name and righteousness; and this
is the record God hath given of his dear Son. And here, Lord, is the new
testament of thy blood, which thou hast given for sinners. Thou, blessed
Lord, wilt know thine hand, and own thy word. Thou therefore shalt
answer for me, O Lord my God!</span></p>

<p>"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than
half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an
atonement for your souls."—Exod. xxx. 15.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this sweet scripture, and mark the graciousness
of thy God and Father in the blessed truth conveyed in it. What, were
all the souls of the redeemed charged equally alike in the account of
God? Did God thy Father rate them thus? And did Jesus, thy precious
Jesus, purchase all his redeemed with an equal price, when he bought
them with his blood? If this be so, my soul, it must follow, that thou,
a poor unworthy creature as thou art, overlooked as thou art by the
great ones of the earth, and too frequently overlooked in thyself how
precious every redeemed soul must be in Jesus's sight, cost as much to
Jesus as the soul of Peter, or of Paul, or of any of the patriarchs,
apostles, or prophets. Oh, think of this; write it down in the tablets
of thy remembrance. Will not this tend to endear Jesus yet more to thee,
and bring home thy Father's love in the strongest affection? Add one
thought more to this precious relation. If to Jesus thy redemption cost
as much as any one of the redeemed in glory, think, my soul, after such
a purchase, such a price, will he lose his property? will he forego what
cost him so dear, and suffer one pearl of his mediatorial crown to be
wanting? Add another sweet thought, my soul, to this delightful
meditation. If, amidst the various inequalities of life, some poor and
some rich, yet whatever difference was allowed, or even expected in
other offerings, according to the abilities of God's people; yet here,
as a representation of the offering of the soul in Jesus' purchase, no
one distinction was to be made. Is it not plain that the redemption by
Jesus is in him, and him only; and "his righteousness is unto all, and
upon all, that believe; for there is no difference." Dearest Lord may my
soul never lose sight of this blessed equality. Here thou art, indeed,
no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>"And he, bearing his cross."—John xix. 17.</p>
<p>Were grace always in lively exercise, how would every incident in the
life of Jesus lead out the souls of his redeemed in endless
contemplation Alas! my honoured Lord! how little do I think of thee, and
of thy sufferings! Will Jesus, this evening, awaken me to the solemn
subject? The bell of the neighbouring church is now tolling the curfew
of the day. I hear it from my window. Ali! why should I want such a call
to think on my Lord! Awake, awake my soul, and let thy meditation take
wing, and flee to Gethsemane, and from the garden, and the hall, behold
the Lamb of God bearing his cross towards the place of execution. Oh!
Pilate! thou unjust judge! is this thy pretended innocency, to suffer
him whom thou didst declare to be innocent, in the moment thou didst
pass sentence for his death, to bear his cross also? See what long
furrows the ploughers have ploughed upon his sacred back; and wilt thou
compel him to bear the heavy weight upon a part so tender? See! Jesus
faints under it! Will none of those whose souls he hath redeemed, and
whose bodies be hath healed, help the Lord of life and glory? Where are
his disciples? Are there none to aid? Not one to be found that dares
assist him? Pause, my soul, over the sad contemplation! Christ is here,
as his type represents him, the gospel Isaac, carrying the wood for his
own burnt-offering. "In all things it behoved him to be made like unto
his brethren." It was his office to be as a sheep before led as a lamb
to the slaughter, and his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth."
"It pleased the Father to bruise him, and to put him to grief." The
cross was ponderous. The body fainted under its pressure. But the sins
of his redeemed made it heavier to his soul; and the weight of the
Father's wrath against sin, aggravated the dreadful load. Precious
Redeemer, dying Lamb of God! were my sins adding to thy sorrow? Have I
been reproaching Pilate, and all the while forgetting that every
trasgression of mine became more painful to thy soul than the cross, or
the thorns, or the soldier's spear that pierced thine heart? Oh! for
grace to crucify those sins which nailed thee to the cursed tree! Oh!
for grace to take up the cross and follow thee, day by day. Lord Jesus,
I would pray thee to give me grace, to go forth unto thee, "without the
camp, bearing thy reproach."</p>

<p>"Behold the Lamb of God!"—John i. 36.</p>
<p>Who is it calls upon thee, my soul, to this most gratifying and
enriching of all employments? Is it not God the Holy Ghost, by the
ministry of his servant John? And doth not God thy Father do the same by
the ministry of his servant Isaiah, when be bids thee behold him in whom
his soul delighteth? And is not Jesus himself calling, again and again,
in the ministry of his word and ordinances upon thy poor forgetful
heart, when he saith, "Behold me! behold me! look unto me, and be ye
saved!" And wilt thou not obey the sweet and gracious calls, on which
all thy present peace and everlasting happiness depend? Precious,
precious Jesus! Yes, my Lord! I would, methinks, so look unto thee, and
so behold thee, until my whole heart, and all its affections, followed
my eyes, and left not a thought behind for a single object besides thee.
I would eye thee, thou dear Redeemer, as the Lamb of God; both where
thou once wast, and where thou now art, and follow thee whithersoever
thou goest. I would behold thee, as the Lamb of God, set up in the
decrees of eternity, from everlasting; for thou art "the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world." I would behold thee, set forth in all the
representations of thy redeeming blood, in the innumerable sacrifices of
the law, and in the lamb of the morning, and the lamb of the evening,
through the intermediate ages, to thy coming. I would behold thee, Oh
thou unequalled pattern of excelling meekness! when, in the days of thy
flesh, thou walkedst through the streets of Jerusalem; and when, as a
lamb, thou wast led to the slaughter. I would eye thee, Oh thou Lamb of
God, until my eye-strings could hold no longer, when as the Lamb of God,
and my soul's surety, thou didst hang upon the tree, putting away sin,
and satisfying divine justice by, the sacrifice of thyself. And never
would I take off my eyes from thy cross, until called by thee to behold
thee as a Lamb in the midst of the throne, where thou art feeding thy
church above, and dispensing blessings to all thy church below. Yes,
yes, blessed triumphant Lamb of God, thou art the Lamb still. Change of
place hath made no change in thy nature, or thy love, or the efficacy of
thy redemption. Thou still appearest as a Lamb that hath been slain. And
still thou bearest on thy glorified body, the marks of my redemption.
Shall I not behold thee, then, dearest Jesus? Shall I not unceasingly
behold thee, thus called upon by the Father, Son, and Spirit, and thus
finding every thing that can satisfy my most unbounded desires for time
and for eternity? Help me, blessed Jesus, so to look, and so to live
upon thee; and Oh, do thou behold me, and bid me live, and make me thine
for ever."</p>

<p>"And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
father; and said, this have we found; know now, whether it be thy son's
coat, or no. And he knew it, and said, it is my son's coat."—Gen.
xxxvii. 32, 33.</p>
<p>The life of the patriarch Joseph is very beautiful and interesting,
as an history only; and the several incidents arising out of it are such
as cannot but more or less affect every heart. But when we have gone
through the whole relation, in the mere letter of the word, we are
constrained to believe, that in the spiritual sense and meaning of it,
almost every thing in the life of Joseph was typical of Jesus! I would
not strain scripture upon any account. Neither would I to myself any
thing fanciful of Jesus and his frame blessed offices; so as to see him
where he is not. Yet I cannot but think, that since in so many
instances, as is universally allowed, Joseph is a lively type of Christ,
the Holy Ghost, in his glorifying the Lord Jesus, was, in many cases,
pleased to shadow forth, somewhat of the Redeemer, where he is not at
first so immediately discovered. Whether in the passage I have just
read, for the present evening's meditation, there be any thing typical
of Jesus, I know not; but to those who, like Philip, have "found him of
whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth;"
the coat of the patriarch, dipped in the blood of the kid, may minister
in leading the heart to the contemplation of Jesus, who appeareth
unceasingly in his priestly garments, in the presence of God our Father,
for us. And may not a believer humbly take up the language of faith,
when drawing nigh to our God and Father in Christ Jesus; and when we
enter, as it were, into his retirings, with earnest prayer, and earnest
pleadings, seeking favour in and through Jesus; may we not, in the arms
of our faith, bring the vesture of Jesus dipped in blood, and say, this
have we found; know now, whether it be Jesus's, thy dear and ever
beloved Son's vesture, or no? Oh! for faith to behold Christ, as the
Father beheld him, when he set him forth to the church, and to love him
as God our Father loved him. And how surely will God confirm his own
gracious testimony concerning him, and say with the patriarch, or in
words to the same effect; "This is my beloved Sons in whom I am well
pleased!"</p>

justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea,
rather, that is risen again; who is even at the right hand of God, who
also maketh intercession for us."—Rom, viii. 33, 34.</p>
<p>See, my soul, what a blessed security thou hast. Here is God
justifying; Christ dying; the Holy Ghost raising the sinner's surety
from the grave, as an evidence that the debt of sin is cancelled; and
Jesus ever living to see the travail of his soul, and be satisfied in
the redemption of his people. What, then, shall rob thee of thy comfort,
while thou art triumphing in thy Jesus? Sin shall not; for Jesus hath
put it away by the sacrifice of himself. The law cannot; for thy Jesus
hath answered all its just demands. Divine justice cannot; for God
himself justifieth. Death and hell cannot; for Jesus hath conquered
both. In short, all that stood in thy way, the Son of God hath removed.
And wilt thou not, my soul, triumph in the great salvation of thy Jesus?
Surely the poor debtor may walk as boldly before the prison door, as the
king in his palace, when his debts are paid. No bailiff can touch him;
no mittimus again confine him. "If the Son shall make you free, you
shall be free indeed." Triumph then, my soul, in the liberty wherewith
thy Jesus hath made thee free; only be sure that all thy triumphs are in
him. Let him have all the glory, who hath wrought the whole redemption.
Make thy Jesus all; for he hath done all for thee; and then sweetly
repose thyself upon the person and work of thy beloved, Let the
adversary accuse, or opposition arise from without or within, yet, saith
an apostle, here is the answer:—"God justifieth; for Christ died." Oh,
how precious it is, after all the storms, and widds, and boisterous
tossings, of law and conscience, to enter into that harbour, which is,
Jesus. "We which have believed," saith the apostle, "do enter into
rest." He is indeed the rest, wherewith he causeth the weary to rest;
and he is the refreshing.</p>

<p>Yes! dearest Lord Jesus, thou art all this, and infinitely more to my
soul; more fragrant than both, and more precious than all the flowers of
the field. Help me, this evening, to contemplate my Lord under those
sweet similitudes. Do I not, and shall I not henceforth, in the red
blushing beauty of the rose, behold thy human nature, which thou hast
assumed for the redemption of thy people? Are not thy bloody sufferings,
and thy red apparel, strikingly set forth by the image of the rose; as
thy spotless purity is shewn under the loveliness of the white lily? Can
the sweet-scented rose, even of Sharon, vie with the perfume of the
incense of thy righteousness, to a poor sinner's soul? Or can the beauty
of the lily be as grateful to the eye, as the purity of Jesus to a mind
conscious of its own pollution, and beholding itself complete in his
salvation, who is "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and
made higher than the heavens?" But wherefore Sharon's rose, and the
valley's lily, unless it be to speak thine infinite greatness in the
excellency of Sharon, and thine infinite humbleness, in the lowest part
of the earth, as the valley. And indeed, Lord, in thine own wonderful
person, thou comprehendest all things, in the length, and breadth, and
depth, and heighth! Thou art both "Alpha and Omega; the first and the
last." And though Lord of all, thou didst condescend to become servant
of all; be thou to me, my Lord, every thing that is precious and lovely,
as the rose of Sharon, and as the lily of the valley. And Oh! give a
sweet conformity to thyself, and thy loveliness. And though my sins be
red as scarlet, do thou make them whiter than the snow; though they be
as the crimson, do thou make them as the wool! Cause me to be washed in
that fountain, which thou hast opened for sin and for uncleanness; and
bring me to join that happy multitude, before thy throne, "who have
washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb!"</p>

<p>My soul thou hast not forgotten what thou wert so lately engaged in,
a day or two since, at the call of God the Holy Ghost, to behold the
Lamb of God. And art thou not still looking at him, gazing upon him,
feasting thine eyes, thine heart, all thy affections, upon him, and
following him, in the sweet contemplation, from his cross to his crown.
Come then, my soul, harp again and again upon this blessed string; for
sure it is most blessed. And remember, my soul, as thou lookest, thy
Jesus is in the midst of the throne - that is, the very centre of it.
"In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." For what is the
Lamb of God, but God revealing himself in him, to thee, my soul, and all
his people? And remember also, that the throne, in the midst of which
thy Jesus is, in scripture, is called" the throne of God and the Lamb,"
on purpose to shew thee that it is one and the same. And what is that
throne, my soul, but a throne of grace - a mercy-seat, a place for the
poor and the needy to approach, "to obtain mercy, and find grace to help
in time of need?" Flee to it, my soul; haste! stay not; and remember, as
Jesus is in the midst of it, it is accessible every way, and all around.
The poor timid believer, that fears to go in front, may, like the woman
in the gospel, who came behind, touch but Jeslis' garment: efficacy from
the Lamb is in every direction. If Jesus was not there, it might be
alarming to approach; but, remember the Lamb is there—and he is tile
Lamb of God. Sweet encouraging thought! Come then, my soul, look to the
Lamb. See, by faith, how he feeds the church which is above. And will he
not feed the church below? Oh, yes. "His flesh is meat indeed, and his
blood is drink indeed." He is the heavenly pelican, that feeds his young
with his blood. And Oh, what spiritual food, what divine food, what
suitable food, what soul-satisfying, soul. ravishing, soul-strengthening
food! Precious Lamb of God! every thing in thee is food. Feed my hungry
soul, Oh thou that art in the midst of the throne, and send me not empty
away.</p>

<p>My soul! whether or not the decree be as yet gone forth for an early
day for thy removal, as here to Hezekiah, it must shortly arrive; and as
thou knowest not how soon, it is good to set both thine house and thine
heart in order; for he that is best fitted to live, is best prepared to
die. How stands thy great account? This body of thine must go down to
the chambers of the grave. And surely if the soul be safe in union with
Jesus, such an event as the dissolution of the body, is more to be
desired than dreaded. If the pearl be safe, no matter though the casket
be broken. Pause over the view; for though it be solemn, it is
profitable. If a voice from heaven declared the dead to be blessed, who
die in the Lord; then will thy death be blessed, if thou art living in
union with Christ. See to it this night, this very night, whether this
be thy case; all is well if this be well. Hath not the Holy Ghost, in
times long since passed, led thee to all-precious Jesus? And from his
sweet teachings, and constraining influences, hast thou not ventured
thyself upon him? Convinced that there is salvation in no other,"
neither any other name under heaven given among men, whereby thou
mightest be saved;" didst thou not cast thyself upon his blood and
righteousness, and at a time when under the deepest sense of thy sin,
and his all-sufficiency to save? And hast thou not many a time since,
when the false reasoning of men, the temptations of hell, and a host of
foes, from within and without, would have turned thee aside from thy
Lord; hast thou not, by this sweet, constraining, and supporting grace,
been kept leaning upon Jesus? Yea, moreover, hath not that dear
Redeemer, the Lord God of the Hebrews, who first met thee by the way,
brought thee acquainted with himself, and caused thee to believe in him;
hath he not since, in a thousand,, and ten thousand renewed
manifestations of his love, comforted thee, strengthened thee, and made
thee sensible of his gracious presence? Surely then, if he saith to
thee, "Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live!" it
is but the call of Jesus to the exercise of the last act of faith, and
indeed to die to this world only, that thou mayest live with him in
glory in a better. And wouldest thou now draw back? Didst thou first
venture upon Christ, when thou hadst known but little of his
faithful-ness;and shall it be said now, that the shadow of a doubt
remains, when multitudes of evidences upon evidences have been given
thee, that he is, he must, he will ever be Jesus? Precious, precious
Redeemer! Oh! for a full tide of thy grace to be poured in upon my soul,
when thou shalt be pleased to send forth a messenger with," Set thine
house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live ;" that I may then
gather all into one, of the many tokens of thy redeeming love to a poor
worthless worm, such as I am; and all the many goings forth of my soul
after thee, through a life of grace, since thou wast pleased to quicken
me to the knowledge and desire after thee; that finally, fully, and
completely, I may, once for all, cast my soul into thy blessed arms,
with a "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."</p>

10—Morning—I Peter 2:7</h3>
<p>"Unto you, therefore, which believe, he is precious."—1 Pet. ii.
7.</p>
<p>My soul, art thou anxious to know whether thou art a true believer in
Jesus? Try it, then, by this mark, which the Holy Ghost hath given by
his servant the apostle. Do you believe in Jesus for life and salvation?
Yes, truly; if so be he is precious. Look at him, then. Is Jesus
precious in his person, precious in his work, precious in his offices,
precious in his relations, precious in his whole character? Do you know
him, so as to love him, to live to him, to rejoice in him, and to cast
your whole soul upon him, for life and salvation? Do you accept him as
the Father's gift, the Sent, the Sealed, the Anointed, the Christ, of
the Father? Is he so precious, that there is nothing in him but what you
love—nothing that you would part with? His cross is dear, as well as his
crown! Afflictions with Jesus, sweeter than prosperity without him!
Pause over these questions. Recollect that there is nothing out of Jesus
that can be truly satisfying. Thy dearest earthly friend, however sweet,
hath yet some tinge, some alloy of what is not sweet. But there is no
mixture in thy Jesus; all is pure, and lovely, and transcendantly
glorious. He is, as one of old described him, a sea of sweetness,
without a single drop of gall. And now, my soul, what sayest thou
concerning Jesus? Is he precious to thee under all these, and a thousand
more distinguishing excelleneies? Say, if Jesus were to be bought,
wouldest thou not sell all thou hast to buy? Were he to be sold,
wouldest thou not rather lose thy life than part with him? Surely, then,
he must be precious to thee: and, as such, thou art a believer; for the
apostle has commanded us to say, that "unto them which believe he is
precious." Take comfort then, my soul: he that is precious now, will be
so for ever. Yes, precious Lord, there is none in heaven or earth I
desire besides thee!</p>

10—Evening—2 Samuel 24:17</h3>
<p>"And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the
people, and said, lo! I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these
sheep, what have they done?"—2 Sam. xxiv. 17.</p>
<p>My soul! here is a subject of an heart-searching nature opened to
thee this evening, in those expostulating words of the man after God's
own heart. Summon up all thy faculties to the meditation; and yet,
infinitely more than this, seek the teaching of the Holy Ghost, that
thou mayest profit by them. The apostle was commissioned by the Holy
Ghost to tell the church, that for man's sin the whole creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain together until now. The slaughter of every beast,
the sacrifice of every lamb, proclaimeth with a louder voice than words
can declare, the baleful malignity of human transgression. And if David,
when he saw the destroying angel brandishing his dreadful sword over
Jerusalem, felt remorse in the recollection of his own sin, and the
punishment falling on the harmless sheep; what views ought the
contemplation of the unequalled sorrows and sufferings of the Lamb of
God to occasion, when it is recollected that "he died the just for the
unjust, to bring us to God?" To see sin as exceeding sinful, we may get
some idea, from beholding apostate spirits cast out of heaven; or from
the curse of Jehovah upon the earth, and all the children of Adam
involved in it; the destruction of the old world by water; or the
burning of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire; and the everlasting torments of
the damned in hell: these form awful views of the dreadful nature of
sin, as it appears in the sight of God. But all these are nothing, in
comparison to one remaining to be mentioned. Wouldest thou see sin in
all its tremendous consequences, thou must go to Golgotha. There behold
the Lamb of God, taking away sin by the sacrifice of himself. Here take
up the words of David, and ask thine own heart, while confessing that
thou hast sinned, and done wickedly, what had this Lamb of God done?—But
do not stop here. Go on in the contemplation. If "he who knew no sin
became sin"—if he who in his sacred person "was holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heaven, yet
became both sin and a curse for his redeemed, that they might be made
the righteousness of God in him;" wilt thou not think it the first, the
last, the highest, the best, the most momentous of all points, to know
whether thou, even thou thyself, art made the righteousness of God in
him? Oh! thou holy, blessed, and eternal Spirit! give me to see in the
Lord Jesus, my almighty Surety, that in all he did, in all he sustained,
and all he suffered, he bore my sins in his own body on the tree, and
that not a single sin of omission or commission was left out. Oh! for
grace to believe, and to plead, now and for ever, before the throne,
that then all mine iniquities and all my trans. gressions, in all my
sins, the Lord Jehovah laid (as Aaron typified on the great day of
atonement, Lev. xvi. 21.) upon the person of his dear Son! Help me,
Lord, with increasing confidence of faith, and holy hope, and ardent
joy, thus to view Jesus as my Surety, and thus to answer the account
given of it in that blessed scripture: "Surely shall one say, in the
Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come, and
all that are incensed aginst him shall be ashamed. In the Lord shall all
the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory."</p>

11—Morning—Isaiah 16:4</h3>
<p>"Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them
from the face of the spoiler."—Isa, xvi. 4.</p>
<p>"When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be
at peace with him." Moab was the sworn foe of Israel, but yet Moab shall
be overruled to shelter and feed Israel. The world, like Moab, dislikes
God's people: but as God's people must sojourn in the world, until the
time comes for God to take them home, they shall be taken care of. "Let
mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab;" house them as travellers in an
inn. See that they have a lodging. Let their bread be given, and their
water sure. "They are poor; but they are my poor," saith our God. "They
are outcasts; but they are mine outcasts." Oh! precious Jesus, I see
thou wilt still own thy people. And wherefore is it, dearest Lord? Not
for their worth, not for their deservings, not for their adherence to
thee; but because thou hast loved them; because the Father hath given
them to thee, and thou hast purchased their persons, redeemed them, and
washed them, and made them thine. Grant, dearest Lord, that though we
are constrained to dwell with Mesech, and to have our habitation among
the tents of Kedar; though we "are made as the filth of the earth, and
the offscouring of all things," yet never, never may we forget our
relationship to thee. Though outcasts, yet Jesus's outcasts. Be thou,
Lord, our hiding-place, our covert, in the midst of Moab; and so shall
we be free from every spoiler; thou wilt be to us all we need—"rivers of
water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
land."</p>

11—Evening—Jude 6</h3>
<p>"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto
the judgment of the great day."—Jude 6.</p>
<p>This scripture, concerning the rebellion, and consequent punishment
of apostate spirits, will form a solemn meditation, my soul, for thy
evening thoughts to be exercised upon. And perhaps, under grace, it may
lead thee to some sweet improvements in the contemplation of the
distinguishing grace manifested to our rebellious nature; while judgment
the most awful, and everlasting, overtook the higher nature of angels.
If we humbly inquire what was the nature of their sin, all we can gather
of information concerning it, was, that it was rebellion against God.
One part of scripture indeed tells us, that "there was war in heaven:
Michael (by which we understand, Michael our Prince, the Lord Jesus
Christ, Dan. x. 2l.) and his angels fought against the dragon; and the
dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not, neither was their place
found any more in heaven," Rev. xil 7, &amp;c. By which it should seem,
that the cause of this contest of the devil with Christ, was personal,
and on account of the kingdom which Jehovah gave him as God-Mediator
over angels and men. And hence, when these apostate spirits left their
own habitation, and were cast out, they set up a kingdom in opposition
to the Lord's. And from their bitter hatred to Christ and his kingdom,
they wreaked all their malice in corrupting and seducing our nature to
join in rebellion against God, Hence "that old serpent, called the
devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world," beguiled our first
parents, and introduced sin and death into this our world; which hath
passed, and must pass upon all their posterity, because "all have
sinned, and come short of God's glory."—Pause, my soul, over the solemn
account. Think, duly think, of the fallen state, into which, by nature
and by practics, thou art brought by this apostacy. And when thou hast
had thy mind thoroughly impressed with the awfulness of such a
situation, turn thy thoughts to the due contemplation also of the love,
and grace, and mercy of God, in thy recovery. Sweetly dwell on the love
of God thy Father, in the gift of his dear Son, for the purposes of
redemption. Mark well the blessed features of the Son in his work of
mercy, in this great accomplishment. And do not overlook, but delight
evermore to contemplate the love of God the Holy Ghost, in condescending
both to bring thee acquainted with the grace of the Father, and of the
Son, and to incline thine heart to the thankful belief of it, and love
of both! And that the whole subject may have its full influence upon
thee, to induce in thee all the suitable and becoming affections of
love, thanksgiving, holy obedience, and praise to the Author of such
mercy; mark well the distinguishing nature of that grace, which hath
left fallen angels in their ruin and misery, reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day, while
bestowing pardon, reconciliation, and favour, upon fallen men, amidst
all our unworthiness, sin, and rebellion. And, Oh, Lamb of God! give me
the continued grace to reedirate for ever on the unequalled love of
thine heart, who passedst by "the nature of angels, to take on thee the
seed of Abraham; that in all things thou mightest be made like unto thy
brethren, in being a merciful and faithful High Priest in things
pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of thy
people!"</p>

12—Morning—Genesis 7:16</h3>
<p>"And the Lord shut him in."—Gen. vii. 16.</p>
<p>It was a sweet invitation to the patriarch Noah, when the Lord called
him to the ark. Jehovah did not say, go thou into the ark; but, "Come."
So saith Jesus to his people: "Come with me, from Lebanon, my spouse;
with me, from Lebanon." Yes, precious Jesus, to be with thee is heaven;
for thou thyself art the heaven of the soul. But observe further, my
soul: when Noah had entered the ark, what kept him there? "The Lord shut
him in." Yes, neither bolts nor bars were his security; but God himself,
in his covenant engagements, kept him. The patriarch could no more get
out, than the unbelieving carnal throng (who perhaps hung about the ark
when they saw the flood arise, and felt its power) could get in.
Precious Jesus! and what is it keeps thy people now? Is it not thyself?
Are not thy redeemed eternally secure in thee, and thy blood and
righteousness, as Noah in the ark? Yes, thou who hast the key of all
things;" thou openest, and none shutteth; thou shuttest, and none
openeth." In thee my soul is kept secure; for the Lord Jehovah hath shut
me in: and I shall ride out all the storms, and floods, of sin and
Satan; and, Noah-like, rise above the fountains of the greatest deeps,
being shut in in the ark Christ Jesus.</p>

12—Evening—Judges 15:18</h3>
<p>"And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, thou hast
given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall
I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised."—Judges
xv. 18.</p>
<p>Here is a sweet thought, my soul, suggested in these words of Samson,
and wilt thou not hope that the Holy Ghost may make it blessed to thy
evening: meditation? The Lord had wrought a great deliverance for
Samson, in the discomfiture of his enemies: and now on a renewed
pressing occasion, he makes this the plea of looking up for being again
delivered. "Thou hast given," saith he, "this great deliverance into the
hand of thy servant, and shall I now die for thirst, and fall into the
hand of the uncircumcised?" As if he had said, "Shall my God cease to be
God; or shall I now want his help, who hath always helped me in what has
passed? Hath he begun to deliver; and will he now cease to do
so?"—Pause, my soul!—And when thou hast duly made thine observations
upon the blessedness of faith, which, when in lively exercise, always
finds unanswerable arguments for future blessings, in the recollection
of those that are passed, take the same plea to thy Jesus for every
event which thou meetest with in thine exercises. Hath one like the Son
of Man redeemed thee, brought thee out of the hands of infinite justice;
given thee this great deliverance, from both the guilt and dominion of
sin; taken thee into covenant relations with himself; opened a new and
living way for thee in his blood; and doth he ever live to keep it open
by his intercession? Hath Jesus indeed saved thee, loved thee, blessed
thee, given himself for thee, and treasured up for thee a fulness of all
needed supplies of grace for thy sojourning here; and is he gone before,
to prepare an everlasting fulness of glory for thy enjoyment of himself
to all eternity hereafter? And shall any circumstance now befal thee in
the way, to cast down thy hopes, and to lessen thy faith in such a
Saviour? Shall any thing arise to frustrate his designs, or ruin thy
cause? Is it possible, that any new evil, for which Jesus hath made no
provision, can happen; or any unthought of, unexpected calamity arise,
which shall counteract the covenant of redemption, "ordered in all
things and sure?" Precious Lord Jesus! help me ever to keep thee in
view, and then all the springs of dependence on thee will be sure to
flow.</p>

13—Morning—Galatians 3:13</h3>
<p>"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us."—Gal, iii. 13.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Pause, my soul, and contemplate the unspeakable
mercies contained in those precious words. However little thou hast
regarded them, yet they contain in their bosom the whole blessings of
the gospel. It is to Jesus in this one glorious act of his faith, should
the sinner be continually looking. There, the believer should say, there
hangs my hope, my joy, my confidence. "Christ hath redeemed me from the
curse of the law, being made a curse for me." Now, my soul, observe how
Jesus accomplished this great mercy for thee. Whatever Christ redeemed
the sinner from, he became </span><span class="c6">that</span><span
class="c5"> for him. In the act of redemption, by substituting himself
in the sinner's place and room, he redeemed him from that place and
room, by standing there himself. Hence, as the sinner stood before God,
accursed by reason of sin; so Christ, by taking the sinner's sin upon
himself, and standing in his stead to answer for it, was made a curse
also. If, therefore, Christ will come under the law for sinners, that
law will have as much to demand of him, as of sinners. If Jesus, from
his boundless love and mercy, will take the sinner's curse upon himself,
the law will speak as harsh to him as the sinner that is under the
curse: and not only speak, but exact from him all that could be demanded
from the sinner. Pause, my soul! And did Jesus, thy Jesus, thus stand;
thus be considered, and was he made a curse for thee? Did he really,
truly, suffer the cursed sinner's punishment, "and die, the just for the
unjust, to bring sinners to God?" Look to it then, my soul; he hath
bought thee out, paid the full ransom, and taken away both sin and the
curse of sin, by the sacrifice of himself. Shout, my soul, shout
salvation to God and the Lamb! Say, as Paul, "Christ hath redeemed us
from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us."</span></p>

<p>"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth:
if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy"—Ps. cxxxvii. 5, 6.</p>
<p>My soul! sit down this evening, and contemplate the languishing state
of Zion. Did ever the church of Christ lie in more desolate
circumstances than now? Amidst a great profession of zeal for religion,
how little possession of the divine life is to be met with among men!
And who is there that seriously lays it to heart? For whom doth a throne
of grace witness, that they are holy mourners for Zion, and are
earnestly wrestling, night and day, with the Lord, that he would visit
Zion, and make his glory to appear? Where is the priest, the minister of
the Lord, that is weeping between the porch and the altar, and saying,"
Spare thy people, O Lord! and give not thine heritage to reproach?" Joel
ii. 17. And where are the people that seriously lay it to heart? My
soul! what sayest thou of these things, personally considered? Dost thou
really love Jesus? Surely then, thou canst not be indifferent to his
interests? Is not Zion the purchase of his blood? Are not her walls, in
all her ruined state, constantly before him? Yea, is not her name
engraven on the palms of his hands? And shall her name be on Jesus's
hand, and no concern for Zion in thy heart? Moreover, look and see, in
the tribulations of the present day; are not God's judgments abroad in
the earth? And is not his jealousy for his church the sole cause? And if
the nations of the earth are under the frowns of thy God, canst thou
rejoice in aught but the church's prosperity? Are thousands dying in
sin, and shall not the children of God mourn? Where are the trophies of
the Redeemer's precious death and salvation? When shall Jesus see,
agreeably to the promise, the travail of his soul, and be satisfied? Oh!
for a portion of that holy zeal with which the Lord inspired the
prophet, when he cried out, "Oh! that my head were waters, and mine eyes
a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of
the daughter of my people!" Oh! holy Lord! give my soul from henceforth
a more earnest concern for the prosperity of thy Zion! Oh! for grace to
enter, through the blood of Jesus, into the retirings of the Lord, and
to plead with him, as the patriarch did, with an: importunity not to be
resisted, that he would turn the captivity of his people. Oh! take away
the rebuke of thy chosen, and let it be no longer said, of any of thine,
who know Jesus, and have been made partakers of salvation by him: "There
is none to guide her, among all the sons whom she hath brought forth;
neither is there any that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons that
she hath brought up." Isa. li. 18.</p>

14—Morning—Matthew 28:20</h3>
<p>"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I
in the midst of them."—Matt. xviii. 20.</p>
<p>What an encouraging declaration is this of our Jesus, to prompt the
faithful to meet together on the Lord's day; or in short, any day, at
all times, and all places. Observe, my soul, how sweet the Lord speaks;
'There am I in the midst of my people; not by my word only, not as
represented in ordinances, not by the ministry of my servants, but I
myself spiritually. The calls, the motions of grace felt in the heart,
the tender tokens, the manifestations of my suitableness, fulness, and
all-sufficiency; these are all truly mine, which, by the influences of
my Spirit, I communicate among you.' Oh, precious, condescending Lord,
now we see what it is that constitutes a true gospel church—even thy
presence. Thou art the beauty and glory of it; and from thee alone all
power and efficacy is derived. Thy churches are, indeed, as thou hast
taught, the golden candlesticks; and thy ministers are as stars in thy
right hand. But the candlesticks have no light, until thou, by thy
presence, enlighten them; neither do thy servants, the ministers, hold
forth the light of thy word profitably, until thou openest the heart, as
thou didst poor Lydia's, to receive the things delivered, to the
salvation of the soul. Ye ministers of my God! draw all your comfort and
encouragement, amidst all the difficulties you meet with, both from
within and without, in your: sacred service, from this sweet assurance
of Jesus. Whenever you go up to the assemblies of God's people, hear the
footsteps of your Master behind you. And ye, who pant after sweet
fellowship and communion with Jesus, seek it by the footsteps of the
flock, beside the shepherd's tents, where Jesus feeds his sheep. Who
would be absent from that blessed place where Jesus comes to bless? And
Oh, what encouragement to the faithful to bring with them their
unawakened friends and relations to the assemblies which Jesus honours
with his presence. Surely he who wrought salvation in our hearts, can
work the same in theirs. No wonder, when such mercies Jesus brings with
him to his people, that the heart of David fainted to go up to the house
of the Lord, that he might see the power and glory of Jesus, as he had
seen it in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>"Unto the pure, all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving, is nothing pure."—Titus i. 15.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> An union with Christ brings with it the sweet and
sanctified use and enjoyment of all things. My soul, ponder, this
evening, what the apostle here saith, with an eye to this, and behold
thy blessedness in Jesus. Every thing which comes into the account of
what may be called </span><span class="c6">real good,</span><span
class="c5"> can be so no farther than as it is found and enjoyed in
Christ. Creature comforts have nothing in them of good, but what is
derived from the blessedness of the covenant in them. To the pure in
Christ, all things are pure. His gracious leaven in them, leaveneth the
whole lump. And wherefore is it, that to them that are in a state of
unrenewed nature, being defiled and unbelieving, there is nothing pure;
but because there is nothing of Christ in them? They, and all they have,
are under the curse; for every thing is so out of Christ. It is Jesus
which must put a blessing and a relish into even the most common
providences; or, instead of mercy, they will bring forth evil. See to it
then, my soul, that Christ be the foundation of all thine enjoyments. Be
very jealous over thyself, and thine own heart, when thou art most
happy, that it be on Christ's account; or that when exercised with
difficulties, thou still see Jesus in them, and receive them as coming
from his appointment. And learn never to put a value upon any thing but
on his account, and from their connexion with him. This will confirm
what the apostle saith, to thy experience; "To the pure, all things are
pure." For Jesus seen in all, will be enjoyed in all; and will sweeten,
sanctify, bless, and render profitable all. For as there is infinitely
more blessedness in the most common of our mercies, from their
relationship to Jesus, and their coming from him than we are aware of;
so we ought to have the greater regard to him, in all that we enjoy. And
if we consider nothing as a blessing, but what is received </span><span
class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> Jesus, we shall learn to set a
value upon nothing but what is brought home to the heart </span><span

<p>"With purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord."—Acts xi.
23.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, art thou cleaving to thy Jesus? It is a
grand thing so to do; and it must be from continued supplies of grace in
Jesus, if thou art really doing it. A few points will shew. Is Jesus thy
all? Is he uppermost in all things? Faith hath for its one object,
Jesus. Let a true believer be wheresoever he may—at home, or abroad;
alone, or in company; the closet, or the churchreit is all the same, if
he really, truly, cleaves to the Lord with purpose of heart; there is a
looking unto Jesus </span><span class="c6">for</span><span class="c5">
all thinks, and in all things. Again; if I cleave to the Lord, I shall
do no one thing but in his strength, and deliberately desire nothing but
for his glory. The graces of the Holy Spirit, implanted in the souls of
the faithful, are fed and kept alive, and brought forth into exercise by
the communications of Jesus. My joy then is in Jesus; not in myself, not
in what I feel. These feelings of mine may languish, but while I cleave
to the Lord, my spiritual joy will always be the same. "From me," saith
that sweet Lord, "from me is thy fruit found." Once more - if I cleave
unto Jesus, shall I not find an increasing love for him, an increasing
desire for him, and an increasing communion with him, from increasing
knowledge of him, and of his love and preciousness? To be sure I shall.
Well then, my soul, art thou indeed cleaving to him? Think how precious
Jesus was, when first thou wast brought so savingly acquainted with him
as to see thy need of him, and his suitableness and disposition to save
thee. Dost thou think of these blessings less now? Oh no! You love him
more because you know your need of him more, and therefore cleave to him
the closer. Lastly, to add no more, doth my soul truly cleave to Jesus?
Why then, I am loosening more and more from every thing beside. If Jesus
hath my whole heart, then is the world and all creature idols thrown
down. One Lord Jesus Christ is portion enough for a whole ransomed
church of God to live upon to all eternity. In him there is portion
enough for me. Oh! then, precious Lamb of God, be thou my portion; for
in thee I have all things.</span></p>

hither," and by faith behold the glories which shall be revealed; and
immediately I shall be in the spirit as he was, and so substantiate and
realize, in present enjoyment, those felicities in Jesus, that this
evening my soul will be, by happy faith, in the very suburbs of that
blessed city, "which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God!"
Is it not true, Lord, that all thy possessions are mine? And shall I not
take the map of them from scripture, and look over them with holy
rapture and delight? Do men of the earth take pride in their lands and
manors; the very holding of which is precarious, even in the moment of
possession, and which begin to slide from under their feet, as soon as
they enter upon them; and shall not an heir of God, a joint-heir with
Christ, rejoice in having a kingdom which cannot be moved? Come, my
soul, look within the veil, whither thy fore-runner is for thee entered,
and now that God the Holy Ghost hath opened a door in heaven, behold
what felicities are presenting themselves to thy view. Behold, amidst
all the glories of the palace, how eminently Jesus, even thy Jesus,
appears as a Lamb in the midst of the throne; and still as a Lamb that
hath been slain; as if to testify the eternal unceasing efficacy of his
blood and righteousness. But what an innumerable host are these, which
stand around the throne, and encircle the Redeemer! "These are they
which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
made them white in the blood of the Lamb!" Mark that, my soul! They were
once in the tribulated path that thou art now in; they were once sinners
here below, as thou art now; and they owe all their advancement, not to
their merit, but to divine bounty; not to works of righteousness which
they have done, but to the same source as thou art now seeking
acceptance from—the blood of the Lamb. Oh! precious soul-satisfying
testimony, on a point of such infinite importance! Blessed, for ever
blessed, be God the Holy Ghost, for first opening to the beloved
apostle, this door in heaven, and for all the after-revelations of Jesus
made by this condescending discovery to the church in all ages. Often,
my soul, look up, and behold the door still open; and often by faith
look in, and behold thy Redeemer, and his redeemed, in "the spirits of
just men made perfect." Realize these blessed things, and seek from thy
Jesus, a strength of faith (for such a faith hath been given to some,
and why not to thee?) as shall absolutely bring down the present
enjoyment of heaven into thy soul, before the Lord shall finally and
fully call thee up to the everlasting enjoyment of him in glory. Blessed
be God (my soul, do thou cry out with the apostle) "who hath blessed us
with all spiritual blessings, and hath raised us up together, and made
us sit together in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus!"</p>

<p>"Help, Lord! for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
among the children of men."—Ps. xii. 1.</p>
<p>My soul, art thou sometimes distressed in the recollection of the
languishing state of Zion - are faithful men, faithful ministers, taken
away from the evil to come! And dost thou sometimes, at a mercy-seat,
feel thyself drawn out in fervent prayer, that the Lord would fill up
the vacancies he is making by death, and raise up pastors after his own
heart, and believers who love Zion, to supply their place? Take comfort,
my soul; thy Jesus loves Zion; and she is still engraven on the palms of
his hands, and her walls are continually before him. Jesus must have a
church in the earth as long as the sun and moon endure. Remember, the
reins of government are in Jesus' hands; and however the enemies of
Zion, like wild horses, would ride over the children of Zion, Jesus puts
his bridle in their jaws, and will turn them back by the way they came.
Remember, also, that the care of the church is with Jesus. He saith
himself concerning it, "I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every
moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." Blessed Jesus,
I would say then, Zion is, and must be safe. Die who may, Jesus lives;
and to his church he saith," Because I live, ye shall live also." Here
then is enough for me, for the church, and for every child of God. My
seed, saith Jesus, shall serve him. Hallelujah.</p>

16—Evening—John 13:16</h3>
<p>"And Peter said unto him, Lord! dost thou wash my feet?"—John xiii.
6.</p>
<p>My soul! dost thou want some sweet, some tender, some more than
ordinarily interesting view of thy Jesus, this evening, to draw out all
the finer feelings in love and adoration of thy Redeemer? Look at him
then in the moment in which this scripture represents him, in his
lowliness and meekness, washing the disciples' feet. Had I the power of
drawing the most endearing portrait, Jesus should be my one and only
object; and for a subject of the most finished kind, the humbleness and
tenderness of Jesus, the Lord of life and glory, washing poor
fishermen's feet, should be the picture. And what, my soul, tends if
possible, infinitely more to endear and bring home to the heart this
unparalleled condescension and grace of Jesus, is, that it was, as the
evangelist relates it, at a time when Jesus knew that all things were
given by his Father into his hands: that is, all things relating to his
mediatorial kingdom; that he should give eternal llfe to as many as the
Father had given him; and in due time take out of his kingdom all things
that did offend. Was there ever a more lovely, a more engaging instance
shewn, than by the great Redeemer of the world, in this condescending
act? Well might the astonished apostle cry out, in the contemplation of
it, "Lord! dost thou wash my feet?"—My soul! pause over the subject, and
consider it well; and when thou hast duly weighed the matter, let it be
asked, what condescension, what grace, what love, what mercy, will Jesus
think too great for the salvation of poor sinners? Oh! that I had the
power of persuasion, with any poor broken-hearted transgressor, to
convince him that there is nothing to keep a soul from Jesus but
unbelief. I would say to such an one, my brother, Oh! make trial only of
Jesus's love. The greater your unworthiness, the greater will be the
grace of Jesus, in his mercy towards you. And the lower the Son of God
bends down to wash a sinner, the higher surely will he be in the
sinner's love and esteem. Let it be asked, through the whole church of
Christ upon earth, who loves Jesus most, but the sinner to whom Jesus
hath forgiven most? Let it be inquired, through the realms of heaven,
whose song of redemption is the loudest and the best? and the reply must
be, the song of those who were most low upon earth when Jesus first
stooped to wash them. Oh! thou blessed Immanuel! thou, the Lord our
righteousness! never let me forget this instance of thy grace to poor
sinners, but do thou cause it to be my daily encouragement to come to
thee, and under the same conviction as the apostle, to cry out, "Lord,
wash not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."</p>

<p>"Knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from
the Lord: we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
the body, and to he present with the Lord."—2 Cor. v. 6—8.</p>
<p>My soul, is this thy real language? Pause, while thou art at home in
the body, how dark and dim, how few and short, are all the glimpses thou
hast by faith of Jesus. What from the workings of corruption, the claims
of the body, the concerns of the world, and the numberless, nameless,
obstructions which surround thee, how little dost thou know of Jesus J
And wouldest thou desire for ever to live at this distance? Think what
the first view only of Jesus will be, when thou art once absent from the
body, and present with the Lord!—What holy transports will break in upon
the soul, when all the lines of love meet in one centre, to manifest the
Lord Jesus to thy view in his redeeming fulness! If here below a single
hour's enjoyment of thy Jesus, through the medium of his word or
ordinances, be so precious that no felicity on earth are equal; what
must a whole eternity be, in the full uninterrupted vision of God and
the Lamb! If, through the influences of thy blessed Spirit, dearest
Jesus, the tear of joy, and love, and praise, will fall in the
contemplation of thy person and work; surely all the flood gates of the
soul will open, when I see thee as thou art, and come to dwell with thee
for ever. Oh! for grace, then, to long for that blessed hour, when,
absent from the body, I shall be present with the Lord;—"when I shall
be-hold thy face in righteousness, and shall be satisfied when I awake
with thy likeness."</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch! Thou
didst say, woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow; I
fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. Thus shalt thou say unto him:
the Lord saith thus: behold, that which I have built, will I break down;
and that which I have planted, I will pluck up, even this whole land.
And seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not."—Jer, xlv.
2—5.</p>
<p>Here, my soul! take an instruction, and a blessed one it is, when
applied by the Holy Ghost, suited for God's people in all ages of the
church, and in all generations, At all seasons, it is unbecoming in a
believer in Jesus to have a mind hankering after things of the world,
which the carnal seek; but the evil is increased in times of general
calamity. Baruch, though the Lord's servant, yet felt too much desire of
the world's ease. My soul, learn to avoid every thing which may lead to
an attachment to things below; that when thou art called upon to leave
them, their hold may be too little to be felt. And in a day like the
present, doth not thy Lord speak to thee, in the same language as to the
prophet:" Seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not. If I
have been with Jesus, and given in my name to him, "what have! to do any
more with idols?" It is remarkable, that after the Lord Jesus had
instituted his holy supper, and put the cup into his disciples' hands,
he observed, "I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine,
until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom;"
hereby teaching us, that in the dedication of the soul to him, an
exchange is then made of earth for heaven. And as from that hour,
Jesus's cup was the cup of trembling, and of wormwood and the gall; so
the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
And they that are Christ's, are said to have "crucified the flesh, with
its affections and lusts."</p>

<p>"And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not

hearts, that they shall not depart from me."—Jer. xxxii. 40.</p>
<p>Precious consideration to a poor exercised soul, that a covenant God
in Christ, hath not only engaged for himself, but undertaken for his
people also. God will not, and his people shall not. My soul, take a
short view of the foundation of this precious, precious promise. It is
God's everlasting love, everlasting grace, everlasting covenant. And
remember, the Author of it is not changeable as thou art: "with Him is
no variableness, neither shadow of turning." Moreover, it is purchased
by the blood, sealed in the blood, and made eternally firm and sure in
the blood and righteousness of Christ; the everlasting efficacy of which
is as eternal as the Author of it. Neither is this all. There is an
union with the person of thy Jesus. The head without a body would be
incomplete; and, united to his Person, the believer is interested in all
his graces, fulness, suitableness, all-sufficiency: so that this
preserves grace from perishing, because it is an everlasting spring. And
Jesus lives to see it all complete. His intercession answers every want,
and supplies every necessity. Neither is this all; for God the Holy
Ghost sets to his seal, in the heart, that God is true. His quickening,
convincing, converting, manifesting grace in the soul, in taking of the
things of Jesus, and shewing to the heart, becomes an earnest and pledge
in assurance; and all tending to confirm, that God will not, and his
redeemed ones, shall not turn away, but his covenant remain
everlasting.</p>

18—Evening—Acts 21:39</h3>
<p>"A citizen of no mean city."—Acts xxi. 39.</p>
<p>It certainly was very laudable in Paul, in a moment of danger, to
avail himself of the common privileges of his freedom, in the common
rights of men. But it would have been a sad thing for the apostle, had
he not, at the same time, been also "a fellow citizen with the saints,
and of the household of God." He, like the patriarchs, knew his right in
that city "which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." My
soul! see to it, this evening, that thy name is enrolled among the
citizens of those who are built upon the" foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone." And if
thou canst find evidences of this high calling, thou wilt know also, as
well as Paul, that thou art "a citizen of no mean city." Now a city that
hath "foundations, and whose builder and maker is God," differs totally
from all the cities founded among men. All these have their rise, their
increase, and fall. Where are the vast monarchies of past generations?
Alas! time hath passed over them as a flood, and swept them all away.
And what the sacred writer hath said of one, may be equally applied to
all: "Babylon, the great, is fallen, is fallen; in one hour is thy
judgment come!" But the citizenship of a believer is firm, eternal, and
secure. God the Father is the founder of it: he hath laid the
foundation-stone in Zion. God the Son is the Rock on which it is built.
And God the Holy Ghost is the eternal source of life and strength, and
all the immutable privileges of it. This city is everlastingly and
eternally secure, for "salvation hath the Lord appointed for walls and
bulwarks." And the peace and happiness of its inhabitants must ever
remain the same; for the citizens are of one body, and one spirit, even
as they are called, in one hope of their calling. For the Son of God
hath made them free by his blood and righteousness, and they are free
indeed. Such, my soul, among numberless other distinguishing characters,
are the outlines of the history of that city which hath foundations, and
of which we may say, with the psalmist, "Glorious things are spoken of
thee, O city of God!" If thou art a citizen of it, the enrolment of thy
name among the free-men may be easily seen, for Jesus, the King of Zion,
must have signed it with his blood. And then art thou come, as the
apostle describes, not to the mount that might be touched, and that
burned with fire: not unto blackness and darkness, and tempest; but unto
Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company of angels; to the general assembly and
church of the first-born, which are written in heaven; and to God, the
Judge of all; and to the "spirits of just men made perfect;" and to
Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling.
Then, have you found also the blessedness of the place, and the immense
privileges of its inhabitants? In the freedom of this city is found
peace with God, through the blood of the cross; and access at all times,
through him, by one Spirit, unto the Father. And as among other citizens
there are certain marks and characters, by which the privileges of one
city are distinguished from another; so in this, the language, the
dress, the manners, and customs, are wholly foreign to all the rest of
the world. A citizen of God's house, talks the language of God; he is
dressed in the garment of salvation, and the robes of Jesus's
righteousness. His manners and customs are altogether peculiar to a
child of God and art heir of heaven; for all is in conformity to the
gospel of Christ. My soul! what sayest thou to these characters? Are
they thine? If so, thou mayest assume Paul's account of himself; for,
like him, thou art "a citizen of no mean city."</p>

<p><span class="c5"> My soul! art thou a prisoner of Jesus Christ? See
to it, if so, that, like the apostle, thou art bound with Jesu's chains
for "the hope of Israel." They are golden chains. When Paul and Silas

for joy. Men have </span><span class="c6">their</span><span class="c5">

the closest prisons of men, can shut God out from comforting his
prisoners; and, on the contrary, nothing can come in to afflict Jesu's
prisoners, when he keeps them by the sovereignty of his grace, and love,
and power. Blessed Lord! look upon thy poor prisoner; and come in, dear
Lord, with thy wonderful condescension, and do as thou hast said: sup
with him, and cause him to sup with thee.</span></p>

<p>"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows."—Isa.
liii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul! call up, this evening, all thy most earnest and most solemn
thoughts, to the meditation of a subject, which the Holy Ghost opens to
thy view in these words. And if the Lord the Spirit, that proposeth to
thy soul the solemn consideration, will graciously instruct thee through
it, perhaps it will lead to such views of Jesus as may not before so
fully have struck thine attention. Oh, Lord! guide thy servant in it!
Now here it is said, "He hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows." By which, it may be supposed, is meant, both the curse and the
punishment. And certain it is, that unless Christ bore both, the sinner
is not freed. From the sinner, or his surety, God's justice must exact
full payment. But if it be found that in the surety that exaction hath
been made, and fully paid, then is the sinner free; for from both it
would be unjust to exact. Now behold, my soul, in the person of thy
surety, how in the most minute points, even as the sinner himself, thy
Jesus stood for thee. And then see, from beholding thy Redeemer in this
most endearing point of view, whether thou art not constrained to cry
out, with the prophet, "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows!" A few of the most prominent features in the griefs and sorrows
of Jesus, will be sufficient in point, by way of illustration. And
first, every sinner, by virtue of being a transgressor, is exposed to
the curse of God; and that curse is upon every thing belonging to him,
as Moses told Israel; "Thou art cursed in thy basket, and in thy store;
in lying down and rising up; in going out and coming home." Deut.
xxviii. 16, &amp;c. Now Jesus, as the sinner's surety, is, by way of
peculiar emphasis, called "the man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief." He endured, in his person, the very curse denounced upon the
sinner. All was poured upon Jesus, through every part of his life: and
as the curse, but for Jesus's interposition, would follow the sinner in
death; so Christ was followed by it to the cross. The sinner's dying
chamber would open to him the horrors of divine wrath on sin; such as
Jesus, for the sinner, sustained in the garden of Gethsemane. And as no
by-standers, no earthly friends, could mitigate the horrors of the
sinner's soul in such a season; so we find Christ, when going through
these conflicts for the sinner, could gain no help from any of his
disciples—"they all forsook him and fled." And doth the sinner's
conscience then betray and aggravate the load of woe? And did not Judas,
Christ's bosom friend, come boldly forward to aggravate the Redeemer's
sorrow? And as every sinner, out of Christ, for whom he, as the surety,
hath paid no ransom, would in the moment of death, be seized, bound hand
and foot, and carried away by an armed band to utter darkness, where
there is weeping and gnashing of teeth; so Christ was taken, as the
sinher's surety, by an armed band, from the high priest to the
judgment-hall, where he lay all night, suffering the punishment of
stripes and mocking. And as, in the morning of the resurrection, sinners
out of Christ, must arise to all the horrors of judgment; and the
irreversible sentence be pronounced in the presence of all beholders,
which consigns them to everlasting punishment; so Christ, the surety for
his sinful people, in the morning was brought from the hall of Pilate to
the hill of Calvary, and there received the sentence of death, executed
upon his sacred person, in the view of all that passed by.—Pause, my
soul, over the representation of truths so awful! Surely thou mayest
say, if Jesus had not sustained the curse and punishment, then must I
have borne it for ever. But if, as the prophet hath marked it in this
most blessed scripture, "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried
our sorrows," then is the principal debtor free, when the surety hath
paid the debt! Oh! the preciousness, the suitableness, the completeness
of Jesus, in the whole purpose Of his redemption. Blessed, blessed,
blessed for ever, be Jehovah, for Jesus Christ!</p>

Are his providences afflicting? Art thou brought under bereaving
visitations? Is thy earthly tabernacle shaken by sickness? Are the pins
of it loosening? Are thy worldly circumstances pinching? Is prayer
restrained? Oh, refer thy state, my soul, be it what it may, to Jesus.
Tell thy Lord, that of all things, thy greatest dread and fear is, lest
thou shouldest be mistaken concerning his love to thee. Say, as Job did,
"Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me." There is an Achan in the
heart. Thy Jesus doth not withdraw for nothing. Love is in his lips.
Salvation fills the whole soul of Jesus. Fly to him, then, my soul! Say
to him, Lord, make me what thou wouldest have me to be. Oh! for a word,
a whisper of Jesus. I cannot live without it. I dare not let thee go,
except thou bless me. Not all the past enjoyments, experiences,
manifestations, will do me good, until thou again shine in upon my soul.

exaltation at the right hand of Pharaoh, have had upon the mind of the

But what are all these feelings of nature, compared to the triumphs of

redemption, wrought out and accomplished by one that is his brother,

exalted Saviour! by faith I behold thee on the right hand of the Majesty
on high; and all power is thine in heaven and on earth. I hear thee
giving commandment to thy servants, to take the ordinances, and the
several means of grace, in thy sacred word, and, like the conveyances of
the waggons of Egypt, to bring all thy kindred, thy redeemed ones, to
thee. Yea, Lord! I would do as thou hast said, "regard not the stuff,"
for gladly would I leave it all behind; for it hath already too long and
too powerfully occupied my poor heart, and robbed my soul of thee. I
would hasten to thy presence; for sure I am, the good of all the land of
heaven itself is thy brethren's, and, what is infinitely more than even
heaven, thou, even thou thyself, blessed Jesus, art thy people's. But,
Lord! how shall I look thee in the face? How shall I dare to draw nigh,
conscious of my having, like the sons of Jacob, sold thee, parted with
thee, denied thee, left thee, and as the Jews of old, preferred every
Barabbas, every robber before thee? And wilt thou, dearest Lord, still
own me, still love me, and still speak kindly to me? Oh! what praises
will the realms of heaven resound with, when Jesus shall have brought
home all his brethren, into his Father's house, around himself in glory!
How will then every knee (and my poor soul among the glorious number)
bow before thee, and every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
the glory of God the Father. Amen and Amen!</p>

person,—his pardoning love,—the renewals of his grace. Jesus knoweth it
all before you tell him, and he will send his gifts and mercies—nay, he
will come himself; for he hath assured me of this. He hath said, "If a
man love me, my Father will love him, and we will come and make our

well-known voice: he saith, "I am come into my garden." Now will I hold

<p>"Being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ."—I Cor.
ix, 21.</p>
<p>Sit down my soul, this evening, and ponder over this blessed
distinction which the apostle makes between the lawless conduct of
those, who, from a mere conviction of the truth in the head, but who
never felt the influences of it in their heart, hold the truth in
unrighteousness; and those who, while conscious of being under the law
to Christ, are not without law to God. To thee, my soul, who hast been
brought under the condemnation of God's holy law, and hast been enabled,
through sovereign grace, to take refuge in the person, blood, and
righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ; to thee, justification by faith,
so far from relaxing thine obedience to the law of God, has proved the
best of all motives to the practice of it. Thou knowest thyself to be
bought with a price; and therefore, as the Lord's property, both by his
purchase, and thy voluntary surrender, it is thy desire above all
things, "to glorify God in thy body and in thy spirit, which are his."
It is thy glory, thy delight, thy joy, that thy God and Father hath
accepted a righteousness for thee in Jesus, thy Surety; and to him, and
him only, the Lord hath respect for thy acceptation. But while thou art
taught, and thy heart delights in the soul-reviving truth, that thou art
never to seek justification by the deeds of the law; thy heart delights
also, that thou art "not without law to God, but under the law to
Christ." For though the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
made thee free from the law of sin and death; yet while through the law,
thou art dead to the law, the blessedness of it is, that thou mightest
live unto Christ. And it is by the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus
from the dead dwelling in thee, that the deeds of the body are
mortified, and the soul lives. Sweet consideration, my soul, to cherish,
and ever to keep in view. Thou art not working for life, but from life.
Not seeking to be justified by the deeds of the law; but from Christ's
justification, daily shewing forth that "thou art not without law to
God, but under the law to Christ."</p>

the family of God in Christ? Not from the assaults of sin; for thou
still carriest about with thee a body of sin, under which thou groanest.
Not from the temptations of Satan; for he is still levelling at thee
many a fiery dart. Not from outward troubles; for the world thou art
still in, thou findest it a wilderness state. Not from inward fears; for
thine unbelief begets many. Not from the chastisement of thy wise and

thee the glory of Jesus, and thy interest in him, brought thee into? Oh,
who shall write down the vast, the extensive account of thy freedom?
Say, my soul, hath not the sight of God's glory in Christ freed thee
from the curse of the law,—from the guilt of the law,—from the dominion
of sin,—from the power of Satan,—from the evil of unbelief in thine own
heart,—from the terrors of justice,—from the alarms of conscience, from
the second death? Say, my soul, doth not the sight of Jesus dying for
thee, rising for thee, pleading for thee, enlarge thine heart, and lose
thy bonds, and shake off all thy fetters and all thy fears? Doth not
Jesus in the throne give thee liberty to come to him, to call upon him,
to unbosom thyself unto him, to tell him all thy wants, all thy
necessities, and to lean upon his kind arm in every hour of need? Shout,
my soul! and echo to the apostle's words,—"Where the Spirit of the Lord
is there is liberty:" liberty to approach, liberty to plead, liberty to
pray, liberty to praise and to adore the whole persons of the Godhead,
for having opened the prison-doors, and given thee freedom in Christ
Jesus!</p>

22—Evening—2 Kings 4:13</h3>
<p>"And he said unto them, say now unto her, behold; thou hast been
careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest
thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she
answered, I dwell among mine own people."—2 Kings iv. 13.</p>
<p>What an interesting account, though short, is here given of the
Shunamite. The sacred historian calls her "a great woman," and
certainly, she here manifests that she had a great mind. What she had
done for the prophet, she sought no recompence for. Neither the favours
of the king, nor the captain of his host, were of any value to her and
her husband. Dwelling with content in what she had, and "among her own
people," was in her view enough of earthly enjoyment. But is there not a
spiritual improvement to be made of the passage? Do not the people of
our God "dwell alone?" And have they not been from everlasting so
appointed, in the purposes of God their Father, and chosen in Christ,
and called? They may, and indeed they ought to desire to be spoken for
to the King, the Captain of the Lord's host, as a people near to
himself. Yes! I would say, let me be spoken for, that I may always live
under an abiding sense of my Lord's presence and his love; and that my
constant views of him, and his gracious tokens of kindness to me, may be
my daily enjoyment. Methinks I would always be spoken for to him, in
this point of view, and always myself be speaking to him; and tell my
Lord that one smile of his, one whisper to assure me of my interest in
him, and my love for him, and his love for me, will be more grateful
than all the revenues of the earth. Here, like the Shunamite, would I
centre all my desires. And while living upon Jesus, it will be my
happiness also to "dwell among mine own people," who are also the Lord's
people, and who, like myself, keep aloof from all unnecessary
acquaintance and connection with the world, to" enjoy fellowship with
the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>"Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? But my
people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit."—Jer.
ii. 11.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over these words! Was it ever known that any nation
changed their dunghill gods for others? Such regard had they for
whatever ignorance had set up, that the veneration never after ceased.
But Israel, above every other nation of the earth, manifested folly, and
even exceeded the most senseless and stupid of men. My soul! dost thou
not in Israel's folly behold thy own? Was there ever one, when the Lord
first called thee, less deserving? A transgressor, as the Lord knew
thee, from the womb! And yet this did not prevent the Lord from calling
thee. He loved thee because he would love thee; gave thee his
Christ,—gave thee his Holy Spirit—gave thee the name, the privilege, the
adoption of a son. What returns hast thou made? How often since hath thy
backslidings, thy coldness, thy departures, been like Israel? What
vanity, what pursuit, what unprofitable employment, hath not at times
been preferred to thy God? Oh how do I see my daily, hourly, continual
need of thee, thou that art the hope of Israel, and the Saviour thereof!
Keep me, Lord, near thyself; for without thee I am nothing.</p>

23—Evening—Revelation 2:17</h3>
<p>"The hidden manna."—Rev. ii. 17.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> We have an authority from Jesus himself, to say,
that He, and He alone, is the manna of the gospel; for in his discourse
with the Jews, he called himself, in allusion to the manna of the
wilderness," the living bread," and" the bread of God which came from
heaven," of which, he said, "whosoever should eat, should live for
ever." But when Jesus imparts this blessed food to his people, it is
</span><span class="c6">hidden.</span><span class="c5"> And, indeed,
many of the properties of it are made more blessed, from the very nature
of its secresy. My soul, ponder over the subject a few moments, this
evening, and behold in it, how truly gracious it is in the Lord, to hand
to his people in secret, those enjoyments of himself, of which the world
is altogether unconscious. Mark the outlines of it, and trace it in its
effects in thine own experience. Though Jesus was preached to the world,
both by the law and the prophets; and when appearing in substance of our
flesh manifested forth his glory; yet was he known only to his
disciples: the great mass of men neither knew him, nor regarded him. If
he was preached in types and sacrifices, under the old testament
dispensation, or in open gospel under the new, few believed the report;
the cry still went forth, "is not this the carpenter's son?" But say, my
soul, is not Jesus still "the hidden manna?" Dost thou discover him in
his holy word? still is the word hidden:for though it is read openly by
all, yet the mystery of it is known but to few. Doth the Holy Ghost
testify to thee of Jesus, in thy desires </span><span
class="c6">after</span><span class="c5"> him; in thy communions with
him; in the actings of thy faith </span><span
class="c6">upon</span><span class="c5"> him; and in thy enjoyments
</span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> him? Nevertheless
in all these, however certain and refreshing to thee, thy pleasures are
</span><span class="c6">hidden</span><span class="c5"> from the world.
This is mercy, personal and peculiar; strangers do not, cannot,
intermeddle with this joy. Precious Lord Jesus! give me larger and
fuller enjoyments of thee day by day; and night by night let my secret
and retired meditations of thee be sweet! Oh! for grace to live more and
more upon those hidden privileges, and more and more to prize them. Come
to me, dear Lord! and give me such rich participations of thyself, in
the fulness of thy person, blood, and righteousness, that receiving from
thee "the hidden manna," I may say in thine own precious words, "I have
meat to eat which the world knows not of."</span></p>

24—Morning—2 Corinthians 8:15</h3>
<p>"He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered
little had no lack."—2 Cor. viii. 15.</p>
<p>My soul! here is a delightful morsel for thee to feed upon this
morning. Thou art come out to gather thy daily food, as Israel did in
the wilderness. Faith had no hoards. Thou wantest Jesus now as much as
thou didst yesterday. Well then, look at what is here said of Israel.
They went out to gather—what? Why, in the morning bread—God's gift. Such
is Jesus, the bread of God, the bread of life. And as Israel would have
been satisfied with nothing short of this, so neither be thou. And as
Israel was never disappointed, so neither wilt thou, if thou seek it in
faith, as Israel did. And observe, "they that gathered most had nothing
over;" so "he that gathered least had no lack." Yea, my soul, no
follower of Jesus can have too much of Jesus; nothing more than he
wants—nothing to spare. So the poorest child of God, that hath the least
of Jesus, can never want. The very touch of his garment, the very crumb
from his table, is his, and is precious. Dearest Lord, give me a large
portion, even a Benjamin's portion. But even a look of thy love is
heaven to my soul.</p>

24—Evening—Jeremiah 31:8-9</h3>
<p>"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them
from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind, and the lame, the
woman with child, and her that travaileth with child together, a great
company shall return thither. They shall come with weeping, and with
supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers
of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a
father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born."—Jer. xxxi. 8, 9.</p>
<p>It is blessed at all times to be refreshed with God's promises
concerning the latter-day glory; but more especially at a time when
things are most unpromising. The present hour is eminently so.
Therefore, my soul, see what a cluster of mercies are folded up on this
one branch of them; and let thine evening meditations be sweet of Jesus
and his sure work, in whom, "All the promises are yea and amen, to the
glory of God the Father, by us." Observe, in this blessed scripture, the
certainty of the divine promises being all fulfilled, from the
foundation on which they rest. If God be the God of all the families of
Israel, and if Israel be his son, and Ephraim his first-born, how can
the right of inheritance fail? Surely God is engaged by this covenant
and relationship, and he will fulfil his promises. And what are they?
Why, that he will bring them not only from Babylon, but from all their
places of captivity. Jesus, the Son of his love, is commissioned as the
covenant of Jehovah, "to bring the prisoners out of the prison, and them
that sit in darkness out of the prison-house." There shall be a day when
a nation shall be born at once. They shall be gathered to Shiloh, and
shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and
from the south. Pause, my soul, over these blessed promises. Thou art
frequently put to it for thyself; and art frequently exercised with
fears and apprehensions for the welfare of Zion. But what saith this
blessed scripture? "Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
and gather them from the coasts of the earth." Do not overlook that it
is God who undertakes for them, and not themselves: and what God
undertakes, he will surely perform. Well, but they are much scattered.
Yes! but God will gather them. But they are diminishing. No! a great
company shall return. But they are blind, and do not know the way: they
are lame, and when they know, have no power to walk in it. Yes but,
saith he that made the eye, and he that giveth strength to the lame,
both "the blind and the lame," yea, even the woman in pregnancy, and her
that is in travail, all shall come. "I will be eyes," saith God, "to the
blind, and feet to the lame; I will lead them in a way they know not; I
will undertake for them" And the sole reason is, God's free grace and
covenant mercy in Christ. God is a father in this relationship, to all
the families in Israel; and in him all the families of the earth are
blessed. Pause, my soul, again and again, over this sweet and precious
scripture; and see that these covenant marks and impressions be upon
thee, as a sure unerring token of thy being in Christ, and gathered from
the coasts of the earth; that thou art following Jesus, as Mary
Magdalene did, with tears and supplications. Prayers are quickened by
tears; and tears flowing from the view of a crucified Saviour, must give
energy to prayers. The eye that is looking unto Jesus, will affect the
heart; and the heart that is wounded with the view of Jesus dying for
our sins, will cause tears to fall from the eye; and both will follow
Christ by the waters of ordinances, under the Spirit's teaching and
gracious influences. Lord! give to my soul these tokens for good; and
lead me in the way of salvation for thy name's sake.</p>

25—Morning—1 Corinthians 1:30</h3>
<p>"Who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption."—I Cor. i. 30.</p>
<p>What a sweet subject for my morning meditation is here! Who is it, my
soul, is made of God to thee these precious things but Jesus? And mark
how they are made so. I am a poor ignorant creature, grossly ignorant by
reason of the fall. I knew not my lost estate, much less the way of
recovery. Here Jesus became to me wisdom. By his illuminating the
darkness of my mind, he led me to see my ruin and my misery. But this
would never have brought me out of it; for though I saw my lost estate,
yet still I had no consciousness by what means I could be recovered.
Here again Jesus came to my aid, and taught me, that as I needed
righteousness, he would be my righteousness, and undertake for me to
God. But even after this was done, I felt my soul still the subject of
sin; and how to subdue a single sin I knew not. Here Jesus came again,
and gave me to see, that as he was wisdom to cure my ignorance, and
righteousness to answer for my guilt, so he would be my sanctification
also; purging, as well as pardoning and renewing, by his Spirit, my poor
nature, when he had removed the guilt of it. Still I sighed for complete
deliverance, and to make my happiness sure; and therefore Jesus came
again, that by his full redemption from all the evils of the fall, I
might be made free; and therefore he became the whole together—"wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption." And to stamp and seal
the whole with the impression of God my Father, all that Jesus did, he
did by God's gracious appointment; for he was made of God to me all
these, that all my glorying might be in the Lord. See to it, my soul,
then, that this be all thy glory.</p>

25—Evening—Acts 27:44</h3>
<p>"And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship;
and so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."—Acts xxvii.
44.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful conclusion of a history, which, during the
providence wherein Paut the apostle and his companions were in
shipwreck, afforded large opportunity for the exercise of faith. The
issue, it appears, was not doubtful from the first; for an angel of God
had assured Paul, that God had given unto him the lives of all that
sailed with him. And so it proved; yea, the very wreck of the ship
furnished out means for the people's safety. Now, my soul, here is a
very precious instruction for thee. In the exercises of thy life, learn
from hence to abide firmly by the promise, when every thing leading to
its accomplishment seems to fail. God hath said, that eternal life, with
all its preliminaries, is in his Son; and that "he that hath the Son,
hath life, and shall not come into condemnation." Now let what will
arise, after this declaration of God, like the storm and shipwreck of
the apostle, these are intervening circumstances with which thou hast
nothing to do. Do thou take hold of the promise; for the promise hath
its claim upon God. This cannot fail, whatever else may fall. And
though, like Paul in this voyage, neither sun nor stars in many days may
appear, and no small tempest be upon thee; Jesus is still at the helm,
and thou shalt assuredly escape to land. Yea, the very wreck of all
things around thee, shall but the better minister to this great end. And
thou shalt at length write down the same conclusion to thy history,
which Joshua, the man of God, made of the whole history of Israel: -
"Not one thing hath failed, of all the good things which the Lord your
God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto this very day."</p>

26—Morning—Psalm 17:15</h3>
<p>"As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be
satisfied when I awake with thy likeness."—Ps. xvii. 15.</p>
<p>Is it refreshing to thee now, my soul, the least glimpse of Jesus's
face; the smallest manifestation of the glories of his Person and of his
work; and the very sound of his voice, in his word or ordinances? Think,
then, what will be thy felicity in that morning of the eternal world,
when, dropping thy vail of flesh, he whom thou seest now by faith only,
will then appear as open to thee as to the church above in glory! Pause,
my soul, over the vast thought! What will be thy first sight Of Jesus?
What will be thy feelings, when, without any intervening medium, thou
shalt see him face to face, and know even as thou art known? Precious
Lamb of God! grant me grace to feel the blessedness of this first
interview. Appearing, as I trust I shall, in thine own garments, and the
robes of thy righteousness, and which thou hast not only provided for
me, but put on, what will be the burstings forth of my heart, in the
full view of the glories of thy Person, and the perfection Of thy
righteousness! Surely, Lord, when I thus behold thy face in
righteousness, I shall be so fully satisfied, that the rest after which
my poor soul, through a whole life of grace, since thou weft pleased to
quicken me, hath been pursuing, will pursue no more. My immortal
faculties will seek no more - will need no more. In thee, the whole is
attained. In thee, I shall eternally rest. Thou art the everlasting
centre of all happiness, glory, and joy. I shall be so fully satisfied
when I awake to this view, that here, in thee, I shall be at home. And
what is more, it will be an everlasting duration, not only in happiness,
but in likeness. And as the coldest iron, put into the fire, partakes of
the properties of the fire, until it becomes altogether heated and fiery
like it, so in thee, and with thee, thou blessed Jesus, cold as my soul
now is, I shall be warmed with thy love; and from thee, and thy likeness
imparted, become lovely from thy loveliness, and glorious from thy
glory. Precious, precious Jesus! Is the hour near? Are thy chariot
wheels approaching? Dost thou say, "Behold, I come quickly." Oh! for
grace to answer, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"</p>

<p>"Who is she that 1ooketh forth as the morning; fair as the moon,
clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"—Song vi.
10.</p>
<p>By whomsoever this question is asked, there can be no question of
whom it is said; for the church of Jesus, made comely by the comeliness
which her Lord hath put upon her, is all this, and more, in every eye
that can admire true loveliness; and will be a perfection of beauty, in
the upper and brighter world for ever. The first openings of grace upon
the soul, after a dark night of the fall, may be compared to the beauty
of the morning. But though fair as the moon, it is but a borrowed light,
as the moon, and subject to changes in its inceasings, and in its
wanings also. As long as the sun's influences are upon this planet, its
shinings will be fair. But when objects intervene from the earth, and
the sun shines not, there will be an eclipse of all its borrowed lustre.
Just so the church; and Oh! how often on my soul. While Jesus, the Sun
of righteousness, shines upon me, all is fair and lovely; but if he
withdraws, the night immediately follows. But Oh! my soul, when grace is
perfected in glory; when, as John in a vision saw, that wonder of
wonders in heaven, "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her
feet," (Rev. xii. 1.) then shall the whole church of God shine forth "as
the sun, in the kingdom of their Father." Precious Jesus! give me to see
my clear interest in thee, from my union with thee! And do thou, dear
Lord, so make me strong in thy strength, that during the whole period of
my present warfare, I may be "terrible as an army with banners," to all
that would oppose my way to thee, and in thee. Yea, Lord! let sin, and
Satan, and the world, be ever so united against me; yet do thou put on
me the whole armour of my God, that I may "fight the good fight of
faith, lay hold of eternal life, and be made more than conqueror through
him that loveth me."</p>

<p>"He will be very gracious unto thee; at the voice of thy cry, when he
shall hear it, he will answer thee."—Isa. xxx. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Mark, my soul, what is here said; for every word in
this sweet scripture tells. Thy God, thy Saviour, thy Jesus, knows thy
voice, hears thy cry, and will assuredly answer. He will not only be
gracious, but </span><span class="c6">very</span><span class="c5">
gracious. He waits to be gracious; waits the most suited time, the best
time, the praying time, the crying time; for he times his grace, his
mercy, to thy need. And though thou knowest it not, yet so it is; when
his time is near at hand, which is always the best time, he puts a cry
in thine heart; so that the time of thy cry, and the time for the
manifestation of his glory, shall come together. Is not this to be
gracious; yea, very gracious? So that, while thou art looking after him,
he is looking upon thee. And before thou callest upon him, he is coming
forth to bless thee. Is not this very gracious? Now then, my soul, make
a memorandum of this for any occasions which may hereafter occur. Put it
down as a sure, unnering truth; thy Jesus will be very gracious unto
thee. Never allow this promise to be called in question any more. Next,
bring it constantly into use. Faith, well-grounded faith in Jesus,
should always bring down general rules to particular cases and
circumstances, as the soul's experience may require. Hence, when God
saith he will be very gracious unto thee, it is the act of faith to
answer—if God hath said it, so it shall certainly be. And therefore, as
that gracious God, who giveth the promise, giveth also the grace of
faith to depend upon the promise, the mercy is already done, and faith
enters upon the enjoyment of it. God's faithfulness and truth become the
believer's shield and buckler.</span></p>

<p>"But none saith, where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the

<p>Ah, Lord! is it so, that among men of the world, though they are
oppressed by the world, and the evils of it, and some are compelled to
cry out under the bitterness of their sorrows, yet are there no hearts,
no voices directed to thee? When death entereth into their window, and
taketh away the desire of their eyes with a stroke; or when pains and
chastenings of the body chain them to their beds; do they lament the
earthly bereavements, and groan under the consequences of sin, by which
death and sickness came; and yet in all these things, will nothing lead
their unthinking minds "to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it?"
Will they turn from one creature comfort to another, and strive to fill
up the vacancies made by distressing providences, in their fancied
happiness with any thing, or even nothing, rather than look to thee for
comfort and support under their trouble? Oh! how great are my
privileges, if this be the case, compared to those of the carnal! And
Oh! how distinguishing thy grace to my poor soul, that when sleepless on
the bed, or when pains keep me awake, I can and do look to Jesus, and
say, "Thou art God, my Maker, who giveth songs in the night!" Yea, Lord!
thou hast refreshed my soul with many a sweet song, when all the world
was to me asleep, and could not interrupt my happiness. Oh! how often
have I been blessed with the harmony of the songs of redemption, and run
over in some of the blessed verses of it, how Jesus hath loved me, and
given himself for me. Yea, Lord! may I not say, as the prophet, "Thou
hast wakened me morning by morning; he hath wakened mine ear to hear as
the learned." For methinks I have been often wakened in the night by
thee, and I have found my soul instantly led out by thy grace, to a
sense of thy presence, and to a desire after thee; and was not this, my
Lord, calling, as upon the church of old, "Let us get up early to the
vineyards, for there will I give thee my loves!" Oh! precious Redeemer!
grant me such frequent visits, and such sweet communications of thy
grace; and if in thy wise and kind providences, sickness, or pain, or
afflictions, be at any time appointed me, do thou sit up by me, Lord,
and keep my heart in sweet recollection of thee; that in the multitude
of the sorrows of my heart, thy comforts may refresh my soul; and
frequently may the earnest petition for thy presence and thy love, go
forth in the inquiry, "Where is God, my Maker, who giveth songs in the
night?"</p>

28—Morning—John 13:23</h3>
<p>"Leaning on Jesus' bosom."—John xiii. 23.</p>
<p>Methinks I would contemplate for a while the privilege of this
highly-favoured disciple John. Surely to sit at the feet of Jesus, to
look up at his face, to behold the Lamb of God, and to hear the gracious
words which proceeded out of his mouth, what should I have thought of
this but a happiness unspeakable and full of glory! But the beloved
apostle leaned on Jesus's bosom. Oh, thou condescending Saviour! didst
thou mean to manifest, by this endearing token, how dear and precious
all thy redeemed ones are in thy esteem? But stop, my soul. If John lay
on Jesus's breast, where was it Jesus himself lay, when he left all for
thy salvation? The disciple whom Jesus loved lay upon Jesus's bosom; but
he, whom the Father loved, lay in the bosom of the Father - nay, was
embosomed there; was wrapt up in the very soul of the Father from
eternity. Who shall undertake to speak of the most glorious state of the
Son of God, before he condescended to come forth from the bosom of God
for the salvation of his people? Who shall describe the blessedness of
the Father and the Son in their mutual enjoyment of each other? Jesus,
when he was in the bosom of the Father, had not emptied himself of his
glory. Jesus had not been made in the likeness of sinful flesh. Jesus
had not put himself under the law. He was not then a man of sorrows. He
was not then acquainted with grief. He had not then exposed his face to
shame and spitting; neither to poverty, temptation, the bloody sweat,
and the cross. And did Jesus go through all these, and more? Did Jesus
leave the Father's bosom; and did the Father take this only-begotten,
only-beloved Son from his bosom; that John might lean on Jesus's bosom,
and all the redeemed, like him, one day, dwell with Jesus, and lean and
rest in his embraces for ever? Oh, for hearts to love both the FATHER
and the SON, who have so loved us; that we may be ready to part with
all, and forsake all, and die to all, that we may live in Jesus, and to
Jesus, and rest in his bosom for ever.</p>

<p>"Having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto
the end."—John xiii. 1.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Sweet thought, my soul, for thee everlastingly to
cherish; thy Jesus is the same, and his love the same, amidst all thy
changings: yet he abideth faithful. His love, and not thy merit, was the
first cause of thy salvation; and the same love, and not thy
undeservings, is the final cause wherefore thou art not lost. But mark
in this blessed scripture, how many sweet and lovely things are said.
Jesus hath a people, and that people are in the world, and that people
are his own. What! had he not a people in the other world? Yes! by
creation all are his, in common with the Father. But by redemption he
had none, until he had redeemed them from this present evil world. And
observe how very graciously they are spoken of. They are his own, his
peculiar people, his treasure, his </span><span
class="c6">Segullah,</span><span class="c5"> his jewels. And how dearly
doth he prize them! They were first given to him by his Father; that
made them dear. They are the purchase of his blood; this made them dear
also. He hath conquered them by his grace; this endears them to himself
as his own. And though they are in this world, too much engaged in the
affairs of the world, and too much in love with the world, yet Jesus's
love is not abated: their persons are still dear to Jesus, though their
sins he hates. The same love which prompted his infinite mind to stand
up for their redemption; the same love is going forth unceasingly, and
without change or lessening, to accomplish and render effectual that
redemption. Precious Lord Jesus! Oh for grace to love thee, who hast so
loved us! And while thou condescendest to call such poor sinful worms
thine own, and to love them as thine own, and consider every thing done
for them and done to them as to thyself; shall not a portion of such
love be communicated to my poor heart, that I may love thee as my own
and only Saviour, and learn to love thee to the end, as thou hast loved
me and given thyself for me, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling sayour?</span></p>

1—Morning—Isaiah 4:6</h3>
<p>"And his name shall be called Wonderful."—Isa. ix. 6.</p>
<p>In the opening of the last month, the fragrancy of Jesus's name, as
Emanuel, gave a sweet savour to my soul. May He, whose name is as
ointment poured forth, give a new refreshment to my spiritual senses
this morning, in this name also as Wonderful; for surely every thing in
him, and concerning him, of whom the prophet speaks, is eminently so.
But who shall speak of thy wonders, dearest Lord! the wonders of thy
Godhead, the wonders of thy manhood, the wonders of both natures united
and centered in one Person? - Who shall talk of the wonders of thy work,
the wonders of thine offices, characters, relations; thy miraculous
birth, thy wonderful death, resurrection, ascension? - Who shall follow
thee, thou risen and exalted Saviour, at the right hand of power, and
tell of the exercise of thine everlasting priesthood? Who shall speak of
the wonders of thy righteousness, the wonders of thy sin-atoning blood?
What angel shall be found competent to proclaim the wonders of the
Father's love, in giving thee for poor sinners? What archangel to write
down the wonders of thy love, in undertaking and accomplishing
redemption? And who but God the Spirit can manifest both in the height,
and depth, and breadth, and length, of a love that passeth knowledge? Is
there, my soul, a wonder yet, that, as it concerns thee, and thine
interest in him, whose name is wonderful, is still more marvellous to
thy view? Yes, Oh thou wonderful Lord, for sure all wonders seem lost in
the contemplation compared to that, that Jesus should look on me in my
lost, ruined, and undone estate; for his mercy endureth for ever. Well
might Jesus say, "Behold, I and the children whom thou hast given me,
are for signs and wonders!" Isa. viii. 18. Well might the Lord,
concerning Jesus and his people, declare them to be as men wondered at.
Zech. iii. 8. And blessed Lord, the more love thou hast shewn to thy
people, the more are they the world's wonder and their own. Precious
Lord, continue to suprise my soul with the tokens of thy love. All the
tendencies of thy grace, all the manifestations of thy favour, thy
visits, thy love-tokens, thy pardons, thy renewings, thy morning-call,
thy mid-day feedings, thy noon, thy evening, thy midnight grace - all,
all are among thy wonderful ways of salvation; and all testify to my
soul, that thy name, as well as thy work, is, and must be,
wonderful.</p>

1—Evening—Hebrews 10:14</h3>
<p>"For by one offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified."—Heb. x. 14.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> I hope, my soul, thou hast still upon thee the
sweet savour of his name, whom in the morning portion thou didst
contemplate as wonderful. And if so, here is another view of Jesus,
presented to thine evening meditation, to keep alive the blessed
fragrancy, and under the Spirit's influence, to preserve both, not only
through the night, but to the morning; and every night, and every
morning that follows, until the night of death be passed, and that
everlasting morning break in upon thee, in which thy sun shall no more
go down, but Jesus himself be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy
glory. Look, my soul, this evening, at thy Jesus, as this sweet
scripture sets him forth, and behold him, in his high priestly office,
at once the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the altar, on which he hath
offered up that one offering, by which he "hath perfected for ever them
that are sanctified." And mark both the preciousness of thy Jesus, and
the preciousness of his work. It is but one offering, and that one but
once offered. For, from its eternal value and efficacy, an everlasting
perfection is given to all them that are sanctified, and set apart for
himself. "For Christ (as the apostle in his delightful manner expresseth
it) being raised from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more
dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in
that he liveth, he liveth unto God," Rom. vi. 9, 10. And what abundant
precious things are contained in this view of the one offering of the
Lord Jesus, which the Holy Ghost is continually holding forth to the
church! It is blessed to behold them, blessed to believe them, and
doubly blessed to be living in the constant enjoyment of them. So vast
and comprehensive is this one offering of Jesus, that it hath not merely
procured the hopes of pardon, but the certainty of it; not only brought
poor sinners into a capability of being saved, but absolutely saved
them; and not only saved them, but qualified them for happiness: yea,"
hath perfected, and that for ever, them that are sanctified." And who
are they? Surely all are sanctified who were set apart from everlasting,
in the council of peace, between the persons of the Godhead, and given
unto the Son, in an everlasting covenant, that cannot be broken: for to
this purport are those blessed words of Jesus himself, in his prayer to
his Father, John xvii. 2. "That I should give eternal life to as many as
thou hast given me." And, my soul, take one observation more, from this
sweet scripture; this perfection, given to his people, by his one
offering, is </span><span class="c6">for ever;</span><span class="c5">
"he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." So that the
blessing runs through all eternity. The efficacy of Jesus's blood and
righteousness is eternally the same. In point of merit, it blows as
fresh and pure, and sovereign, in its pleadings now, as ever.
Hallelujah! Fold up, my soul, this blessed verse, in thy bosom, and
carry it about with thee in thine heart. Let it be among the first and
last of thy thoughts, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Jesus will own it, and prove it to the full, when thou bringest it
before his throne.</span></p>

Corinthians 8:12</h3>
<p>"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."—2 Cor. viii.
12.</p>
<p>Sweet thought this to comfort the soul under small attainments," If
there be first a willing mind." Surely, Lord, thou hast given me this;
for thou hast made me willing in the day of thy power. I feel as such,
my soul going forth in desires after thee, as my chief and only good;
though, alas! how continually do I fall short of the enjoyment of thee.
I can truly say, "whom is there in heaven, or upon earth, that I desire
in comparison of thee?" When thou art present, I am at once in heaven;
it makes a very heaven in my soul: thou art the God of my exceeding joy.
When thou art absent my soul pines after thee? And truly, "I count all
things but dung and dross to win thee;" for whatever gifts thou hast
graciously bestowed upon me, in the kindness of friends, in the
affections and charities of life, yet all these are secondary
considerations with my soul. They are more or less lovely, as I see thy
gracious hand in them; but all are nothing to my Lord. Is not this,
dearest Jesus, a willing mind? Is it not made so in the day of thy
power? But in the midst of this, though I feel this rooted desire in me
after thee, yet how often is my heart wandering from thee. Though there
is at the bottom of my heart a constant longing for thy presence, and
the sweet visits of thy love; yet through the mass of unbelief, and the
remains of in-dwelling corruption in my nature, which are keeping down
the soul; how doth the day pass, and how often doth the enemy tempt me
to question my interest in thee. Dearest Jesus! undertake for me. I do
cry out, "When wilt thou come to me," though I am thus kept back from
coming to thee? When wilt thou manifest thyself to my soul, and come
over all these mountains of sin and unbelief, and fill me with a joy
unspeakable and full of glory? And doth Jesus indeed accept from the
willing mind, he hath himself given, according to what a man hath, and
not according to what he hath not? - Doth my Redeemer behold, amidst the
rubbish, the spark of grace he himself hath kindled? Will he despise the
day of small things? No, he will not. It was said of thee, that" thou
shouldest not break the bruised reed, neither quench the smoaking flax."
Mine, indeed, is no more. But yet Jesus will bear up the one, and kindle
the other, until he send forth judgment unto victory. Peace, then, my
soul! weak as thou art in thyself, yet art thou strong in the Lord, and
in the power of his might.</p>

2—Evening—Exodus 15:23</h3>
<p>"The waters of Marah."—Exod. xv. 23.</p>
<p>My soul! let thine imagination take wing, and flee thou, this
evening, beside" the waters of Marah;" and while thou sittest down by
the stream, see whether thou wilt be able to gather some of the many
improving lessons the Holy Ghost brings before the church, concerning
that memorable transaction wrought there for Israel. We read in the
history of that people, that they had just before sung the song of
salvation, on the borders of the Red Sea, when Israel saw that great
sight, themselves redeemed, and the enemy swallowed up; and they were
now on their march toward the promised land. Three days they had
travelled into the wilderness, and found no water; and when they came to
Marah, though water was there in abundance, yet they could not drink of
it, for it was bitter. In this situation they cried unto the Lord; and
the Lord shewed the people a tree, which when east into the waters made
them sweet. Such are the outlines of the history. Pause, now, my soul,
and see what improving reflections thou canst gather from it. The Lord
thy God hath brought thee also out of spiritual Egypt, he hath led thee
through a new and living way, even the red sea of Christ's blood; and
thou hast begun thy song of salvation also, to God and the Lamb. But
when, like Israel, he is bringing thee through the wilderness, where
dispensations suited to a wilderness may be supposed to abound; how art
thou manifesting thy faith and submission? Reader, what is your answer
to such a question? Methinks I would hope better things of you, than I
dare say of myself. But I too often find, when the waters of life are
like the waters of Marah; when what I proposed for my comfort turns out
to my sorrow, and I discover a worm in the very bud of some sweet flower
I have been rearing up for myself with great care; I feel rebellion
rising within. I blush even now in the recollection of how often I have
been tempted to call in question the divine faithfulness, and, like
Israel, have taken offence, at some little difficulty I have met with,
which afterwards I have discovered, was purposely put there by the Lord
himself, to manifest his watchfulness over me, and how sure my
dependence upon him might have been placed. Reader! doth your heart find
but too much correspondence to this state of mine? Let us both then do
as Israel did, when at any time our waters are like the waters of Marah,
cry unto the Lord. Let us put the cross of Jesus into the stream, be it
what it may, (for that is the tree which the Lord sheweth his people,)
and never doubt, but Jesus's cross, though to him more bitter than gall,
yet to us will prove the sweetener of all our crosses. Yes! thou dear
Lord! thou didst drink the cup of trembling even to the dregs, that in
the view of it, thy redeemed might take the cup of salvation, and call
upon the name of the Lord. Thy cross, if cast into a sea of trouble,
will alter the very properties of affliction to all thy tried ones. In
every place, and in every state, while my soul is enabled to keep thee
in remembrance, and "thy wormwood, and thy gall;" the wilderness of all
my dispensations will smile, and blossom as the rose. I shall then learn
to bless a taking God, as well as a giving God, for both are alike from
the overflowings of thy mercy; and, like the apostle, I shall then have
learnt the blessedness of that state, "to glory in tribulation, that the
power of Christ may rest upon me."</p>

3—Morning—Ephesians 3:18-19</h3>
<p>"That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the
breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of
Christ, which passeth knowledge."—Eph, iii. 18, 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Did Paul pray that the church might be thus
blessed? So should all faithful pastors. And there is enough in Jesus to
call up the everlasting contemplation of his people. All the dimensions
of divine glory are in Jesus. Who, indeed, shall describe the extent of
that love which passeth knowledge? But, my soul, pause over the account.
What is the breadth of it? Jesus's death reaches in efficacy to all his
seed—all his children: to thee, my soul; for thou art the seed of Jesus.
And though that death took place at Jerusalem near two thousand years
since, yet the efficacy of his blood, as from an high altar, as
effectually washes away sin now, as in the moment it was shed. Remember,
Jesus still wears the vesture dipped in blood. Remember, Jesus still
appears as the Lamb slain before God. Indeed, indeed, Jesus was the Lamb
slain from the foundation of the world. So that, in </span><span
class="c6">breadth,</span><span class="c5"> it is broader than the sea,
taking in all the seed of Jesus, through all ages, all dispensations,
all the various orders of his people. Neither is the </span><span
class="c6">length</span><span class="c5"> of it less proportioned. Who
shall circumscribe the Father's love, which is from everlasting to
everlasting? Who shall limit Jesus's grace? Is he not made of God,
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption? Is he not all
this, in every office, every character, every relation? "Jesus Christ;
the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever!" And what is the
</span><span class="c6">depth</span><span class="c5"> of this love, but
reaching down to hell, to lift up our poor fallen nature. And what is
the </span><span class="c6">height,</span><span class="c5"> but Jesus in
our nature, exalted far above all principalities, and powers, and might,
and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
also in that which is to come! Precious God of my salvation! Oh, give me
to see, to know, to entertain, and cherish, more enlarged views of this
love; which hath no bottom, no bounds, no shore; but, like its Almighty
Author, is from everlasting to everlasting. Shall I ever despond? Shall
I ever doubt any more, when this Jesus looks upon me, loves me, washes
me in his blood, feeds me, clothes me, and hath promised to bring me to
glory? Oh, for faith "to comprehend, with all saints, this love of God
which passeth knowledge."</span></p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

Peter 1:10-11</h3>
<p>"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling
and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for
so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly, into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." 2 Pet. i. 10,
11.</p>
<p>What a very affectionate advice is here given by the apostle; and
surely as important as it is tender! Sit down, my soul, this evening,
and ponder these words of Peter. The apostle saith, and saith it with
great clearness of reason, as well as revelation, that an assurance of
being a partaker of grace in this life, becomes as sure and certain an
evidence of being made a partaker of glory in another. The question then
is, how shall I ascertain, and without the shadow of a doubt, the
certainty of my calling and election? Shall I look in the the book of
life, to see my name there? That is impossible. "Secret things belong
unto the Lord our God; but those that are revealed belong unto us, and
unto our children, for ever." Is there nothing revealed on this
important point in the scriptures of truth? Yes. The apostle to the
Romans, was commissioned to tell the church, that whom God the Father
did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, "them he also
called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he
justified, them he also glorified, "Rom. viii. 29, 30. Hence, therefore,
it must plainly and undeniably follow, that where a soul can fully prove
his having been called, his election is included in the discovery; for
the one is the result and consequence of the other. If I see a stream of
water flowing, there must be a source whence it comes, though the
fountain itself be out of sight. The fruit of any tree will of itself
ascertain the nature and quality of the tree whence it was gathered,
whether the tree be seen or not. And if, my soul, thou possessest clear
and unquestionable tokens of thy being called by grace, in the true
scriptural evidences which the Holy Ghost hath there marked concerning
it, thine election will as plainly be implied. See then if this be thy
case. If thou hast a conviction of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment; if a sense of thy transgressions hath been so marked in thine
heart, as to be followed with a sense of thy utterly lost and ruined
state by nature, and a total inability on thy part to accomplish any
thing towards thine own recovery; and if thou hast been led by the Holy
Ghost, to the view of Jesus, as the only one mighty to save; and thou
art come to him, with the awakened cry of the soul, "Lord, save, or I
perish!" These are among the first and most striking testimonies of an
effectual and saving call by grace. And therefore the diligence the
apostle so strongly and affectionately recommends, is to look into thy
evidences daily, and habitually to live in the enjoyment of them: so
that from long and increasing acquaintance with them, all the great and
glorious objects connected with our future and eternal state, may be
made familiar to the soul. Stedfastly looking to the Lord Jesus by
faith, and living by faith upon him, we may be daily growing up to him
in all things: so that when life comes to be closed, and faith swallowed
up in enjoyment, like a rich and deeply laden vessel in full sail, we
may then have "an abundant entrance ministered unto us, into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."</p>

4—Morning—Psalm 137:4</h3>
<p>"How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?"—Ps, cxxxvii.
4.</p>
<p>Methinks, my soul, this strange land is the very place to sing the
Lord's song in, though the carnal around understand it not. Shall I hang
my harp upon the willow, when Jesus is my song, and when he himself hath
given me so much cause to sing? Begin, my soul, thy song of redemption:
learn it, and let it be sung upon earth; for sure enough thou wilt have
it to sing in heaven. Art thou at a loss what to sing? Oh, no. Sing of
the Father's mercy in sending a Saviour. Sing of Jesus's love, in not
only coming, but dying for thee! Are the redeemed above now singing,
"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain?" Join in the chorus, and tell that
dear Redeemer in the loudest notes, that he was slain, and hath redeemed
thee to God by his blood. Strike up thy harp anew to the glories of
redeeming grace, in that he not only died for thee, but hath quickened
thee to a new and spiritual life. Add a note more to the Lord's song,
and tell the Redeemer in thy song of praise, that he hath not only died
for thee, and quickened thee, but he hath loved thee, and washed thee
from thy sins in his own blood. Go on in thy song, my soul, for it is
the Lord's song. Sing not only of redeeming love, but marvellous grace;
for both-are connected. He that redeemed thee, hath all grace for thee.
He hath adopted thee into his family; hath made thee an heir of God, and
a joint heir with Christ. He hath undertaken for thee in all troubles,
under all difficulties, to be with thee at all times and all places,
until he brings thee home to behold his glory, that where he is, there
thou mayest be for ever. And are not these causes enough to keep thy
harp always strung—always in tune? And wilt thou not sing this song all
the way through, and make it the subject of thy continual praise and
love, in the house of thy pilgrimage? Moreover, the several properties
of the song are, in themselves, matter for keeping it alive every day,
and all the day. Think, my soul, how free was this love of God to thee.
Surely if a man deserved hell, and found heaven, shall he not sing? If I
expected displeasure, and received love—if I was brought low, and one
like the Son of Man helped me, shall I not say, as one of old did—"He
brought me out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay; he hath
put a new song into my mouth, even thanksgiving to our God?" If I think
of the greatness of the mercy, of the riches of the mercy, of the
sweetness of the mercy, of the all-sufficiency of the mercy, of the
sureness and firmness, and everlasting nature and efficacy of the
mercy—can I refrain to sing? No, blessed, blessed Jesus! I will sing and
not be afraid; "for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song, and he
is become my salvation." I will sing now, I will sing for evermore. In
this strange land, in this barren land, in this distant land from my
Father's house, I will sing, and Jesus shall be my song. He shall be the
Alpha and the Omega of my hymn; and until I come to sing in the louder
and sweeter notes of heaven, among the hallelujahs of the blessed, upon
the new harp and new stringed chords of my renewed soul, will I sing of
Jesus and his blood, Jesus and his righteousness, Jesus and his complete
salvation. And when the last song upon my trembling lips, with Jesus's
name in full, shall be uttered; as the sound dies away, when death seals
up the power of utterance; my departing soul shall catch the parting
breath, and, as it enters the presence of the court above, the first
notes of my everlasting song will go on with the same blessed note, "to
him that hath loved me, and washed me from my sins in his own
blood!"</p>

4—Evening—Genesis 16:13-14</h3>
<p>"And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, thou God
seest me: for she said, have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi."—Gen. xvi. 13, 14.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul, what very blessed instructions arise out of this
scripture. Beg of God the Holy Ghost to make thy present evening
meditation of it sweet. The words themselves are the reflection of
Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah, when she fled from her mistress into the
wilderness. In a situation of great distress, the Lord manifested
himself to her, and the conclusion she drew from it, was, as is
expressed, "thou, Lord, seest me." This indeed, was the name she gave
unto the Lord, as if henceforth she would know the Lord in all his
mercies by this name. Sweet thought! Jesus is known by his name; and in
his name his grace is revealed. But Hagar added another delightful
reflection, "for she said, have I also here looked after him that seeth
me?" As if she had said, 'And hath the grace God looking upon me,
wrought grace in me?' But the words may be read differently, and some
indeed read them so: 'Have I looked for the Lord, when the Lord looked
after me? Alas! I thought not of him, until that he called me by his
grace.' Here is another delightful thought of Hagar's, and in perfect
harmony with the gospel of Jesus. For "if we love God, it is because he
first loved us." And there is another reflection, as interesting as
either: "wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi;" that is, "the
well of him that liveth and looketh on." This became Hagar's memorial;
as if she would for ever perpetuate the name of him that looked on and
regarded her sorrow. This well, this place, this sacred spot, shall be
Hagar's Bethel; it shall tell every one that passeth by, here the Lord
wrought, and here he manifested grace to a poor handmaid. Precious
scripture of a precious God! Who but must feel delight in beholding
Hagar's faith? And who but must find cause to bless God, both for giving
that faith, and affording so favourable an occasion for the exercise of
it? And shall I not, and will not you, reader, gather some of the many
delightful instructions from it, for our own use, which it is so highly
calculated to bring? Did the angel of the Lord look on Hagar; and doth
he not look on every child of his? Am I at any time looking after Jesus,
and is not Jesus looking after me? Oh! what a volume of encouragement
ariseth from this one view, to persevere in looking after him, and in
waiting for him; that before I thought of him, or was looking after him,
Jesus was both caring and looking upon me! It is impossible to be
beforehand with God. Put down then, my soul, this conclusion from this
blessed scripture, that in every place, in every state, upon every
occasion, thy Jesus liveth, and looketh on. And do thou call the Lord by
the same name as Hagar did, that speaketh to thee, in every place, and
by every providence, "Thou God seest me." And never, never forget, when
thou art hardest put to it, and art seeking Jesus sorrowing; though, to
thy blind eye, he doth not so immediately appear; that he is still
seeing, and following thee, even when thou art not seeking and following
after him. Let this be in thy constant remembrance; and make every spot
that is memorable, like the well Beer-lahai-roi, to draw water of
salvation from; for in every one it is the well of him that liveth and
looketh on. Precious Lord Jesus! henceforth grant me grace, that while
thou art looking after me with love and favour, I may be looking unto
thee with faith and praise. And through every step of my wilderness
state, while going home to my Father's house, let this be my comfort,
and the burden of my song in this house of my pilgrimage, "Thou God
seest me!"</p>

5—Morning—Judges 8:4</h3>
<p>"Faint, yet pursuing."—Judges viii. 4.</p>
<p>Surely what is said here concerning the little army of Gideon, suits
my case exactly. I know that in Jesus the victory is certain; but I know
also, that I shall have battlings all the way. From the moment that the
Lord called me out of darkness into his marvellous light, my whole life
hath been but a state of warfare; and! feel what Paul felt, and groan as
he groaned, under a body of sin and death; "as sorrowful, yet rejoicing;
as dying, but behold I live; as chastened, and not killed." Truly I am
faint, under the many heavy assaults 1 have sustained; and yet, through
grace, pursuing as if I had met with no difficulty. Yes, blessed Jesus;
I know that there can be no truce in this war; and looking unto thee, I
pray to be found faithful unto death, that no man may take my crown.
But, dearest Lord! thou seest my day of small things; thou beholdest how
faint I am. Thou seest also, how the enemy assaults me! and-how the
world and the flesh combat against me. While without are rightings,
within will be fears. Yet, dearest, blessed Lord, "in the Lord I have
strength;" and how sweet is the thought, that though I have nothing,
though I am nothing, yet thou hast said, "in me is thy help." Thou hast
said, "the righteous shall hold on his way; and he that hath clean hands
shall wax stronger and stronger." The worm Jacob thou hast promised
shall thresh the mountains. Write these blessed things, my soul, upon
the living tablets of thine heart, or rather beg of God the Holy Ghost,
the remembrancer of thy Jesus, to stamp them there for thee. "He giveth
power to the faint; and to them which have no might, he increaseth
strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary; and the young men
shall utterly fail. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up with wings, as eagles; they shall run, and
not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."</p>

5—Evening—Galatians 3:3</h3>
<p>"Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
flesh?"—Gal. iii. 3.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> While beholding the church of Galatia, which set
out upon true gospel principles, and before whose eyes Jesus Christ had
been evidently set forth as crucified among them; yet after this,
turning aside to seek justification by works; let thine evening
meditation, my soul, be directed to this heart-searching inquiry: upon
what art thou building thine hopes of salvation? Is it simply on Christ;
or art thou mingling with the blood and righteousness of Jesus, somewhat
of thine own, by way of justification? The question is exceedingly
important; and the clear answer to it, of the first consequence to thy
present peace, and everlasting welfare. See to it then, that there be no
reserves, no limitations, nothing to qualify the plain and direct answer
to the apostle's words; but that having begun in the Spirit, thou mayest
truly say, thou dost not seek to be made perfect by the flesh. If this
be thy case, thou hast learned to make a nice, but highly proper
distinction between the great object of faith, which is Christ alone,
and the fruits and effects of that faith, which are the gracious
influences that Jesus, by his Holy Spirit, hath wrought in thine heart.
It is very blessed, very desirable, to let the world, both of saints and
of sinners, see our light so shine before them, that it may be not the
subject of doubt, whose we are, and whom we serve. But, if
any-attainments, which, by grace, my soul is blessed with, be made a
part saviour in my views of justification; and I am not looking wholly
to Jesus for this great work, as wrought out and completed by him;
certain it is, that however I might begin in the Spirit, I am now
turning aside to the flesh. Moreover, besides thc motley religion I am
thus taking up with, if what I feel, and what I enjoy in the
</span><span class="c6">fruits</span><span class="c5"> and </span><span
class="c6">effects,</span><span class="c5"> of faith, be made a part of
my hopes and confidence; alas! when those feelings, and those enjoyments
at any time abate, my hopes and confidence will abate also. And if
justification be made a fluctuating principle, is it not plain, that I
shall be void of comfort, when I most want it? And is it not, from this
very cause, that so many precious souls go in leanness all their days,
sometimes feeling hope, but for the most part, exercised with doubts and
fears, according to what they </span><span class="c6">feel</span><span
class="c5">, and not what </span><span class="c6">Jesus is</span><span
class="c5"> in their view; and because in themselves, they are looking
for somewhat that may give a greater confidence in Christ? Pause, my
soul, and inquire how the case stands with thyself: is Jesus the whole,
in the way of a sinner's justification before God? Is he the Alpha and
the Omega also? Dost thou regard him as both the Author and the Finisher
of salvation? Is he the first and the last; and dost thou venture thine
everlasting all upon Jesus? Pause once more, and then say, what are thy
views in this distinction between the works of the Spirit and of the
flesh? Hast thou so learned Christ?</span></p>

Samuel 22:2</h3>
<p>"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt,
and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him, and
he became a captain over them."—I Sam. xxii. 2.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, was not this thy case when thou first
sought after Jesus? Thou wert, indeed, in debt under an heavy load of
insolvency. Distress and discontent sadly marked thy whole frame.
Unconscious where to go, or to whom to seek, and no man cared for thy
soul. Oh! what a precious thought it was, and which none but God the
Holy Ghost could have put into thine heart—Go unto Jesus! And when I
came, and thou didst graciously condescend to be my captain, from that
hour how hath my soul been revived! My insolvency thou hast taken away;
for thou hast more than paid the whole demands of the law; for thou hast
magnified it, and made it honourable. My distress under the apprehension
of divine justice thou hast removed; for God's justice, by thee, is not
only satisfied, but glorified. My discontent can have no further cause
for exercise, since thou hast so graciously provided for all my wants,
in grace here, and glory hereafter. Hail, thou great and glorious
Captain of my salvation! In thee I see that Leader and Commander which
Jehovah, thy Father, promised to give to the people. Thou art indeed,
blessed Jesus, truly commissioned by thy Father to this very purpose,
that every one that is in soul distress, by reason of sin, and debtors
to the broken law of God, may come unto thee, and take thee for their
Captain. And truly, Lord, thy little army, llke David's, is composed of
none originally but distressed souls. None would take thee for his
Captain, whose spiritual circumstances are not desperate. None but the
man whose heart hath felt distress, by reason of sin, and is sinking
under the heavy load of guilt, will come under thy banner. Oh! the
condescension of Jesus to receive such, and be gracious unto them. Oh!
that I had the power of persuasion, I would say to every poor sinner,
every insolvent debtor, every one who feels and knows the plague of his
heart—would to God you were with the Captain of my salvation, he would
recover you from all your sorrow. Go to him, my brother, as I have done;
he will take away your distress by taking away your sin. He will
liberate you from all your debt by paying it himself. He will banish all
discontent from the mind, in giving you peace with God by his blood.
Yes, blessed, Almighty Captain! thou art indeed </span><span
class="c6">over</span><span class="c5"> thy people, as well as Captain
to thy people. By the sword of thy Spirit, which is the word of God,
thou workest conviction in our hearts; thou makest all thine enemies
fall under thee; thou leadest thy people on to victory, and makest them
more than conquerors through thy grace supporting them. Lord, put on the
military garments of salvation on my soul, and the whole armour of God,
that under thy banner I may be found in life, in death, and for
evermore!</span></p>

6—Evening—John 1:29-37</h3>
<p><span class="c5">"She bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,
because I have asked him of the Lord."—</span><span class="c5">I Sam. i.
20.</span></p>
<p><span class="c5">It is really both blessed and profitable to observe,
how holy men of old made memorandums of the Lord's kind dealings with
them, as well in providence as grace, by way of preserving alive a due
sense of divine mercies upon their souls. A night or two since, the
evening portion remarked a beautiful instance of this sort in the case
of Hagar: and in the scripture I have brought forth for our present
meditation, is another, equally beautiful in the instance of Hannah. In
the former, the memorial was set up to perpetuate the </span><span
class="c6">place</span><span class="c5"> of the Lord's graciousness; in
this latter, the dedication is of the </span><span
class="c6">person</span><span class="c5"> concerning whom divine favour
was shewn. But in both, the design is one and the same, to glorify God.
I pause by the way, to-remark, how much to be lamented it is, that this
truly scriptural and pious custom is so little followed by christians,
and even believing christians too in the present hour. What a number of
unscriptural, and frequently heathenish names, are now given to children
of parents professing the great truths of the gospel? Whereas, with
those early followers of the Lord, they called their children by
somewhat that should be always significant of divine mercies. So that,
whenever their children were at any time called upon, or looked to, the
very name might bring to remembrance past blessings, and refresh their
souls in the recollection of the mercies which occasioned them. This
instance of Hannah is beautifully in point, by way of illustration: she
called him Samuel, which signifies, "asked of the Lord." For we find in
her history, with what earnestness she sought a child from the Lord.
Hence, therefore, we may suppose, upon numberless occasions, in
afterdays, whenever, she heard her Samuel mentioned, or she called him
herself, the soul of Hannah went forth in faith, and love, and praise,
to the Author and Giver of this blessing. And it is but reasonable to
suppose, that if the name reminded the mother of her mercy, and she
called her son by this name purposely, that she might remember the Lord
in his bounty; no doubt, she was not forgetful to instruct her Samuel
also in the same thing. We may, indeed, conclude that Hannah betimes
made Samuel acquainted with the cause of his name. And from the sequel
of the prophet's history, we find that he who was a child of prayer, and
asked of the Lord, was a servant to his praise, and given to the Lord.
Reader! methinks it is blessed, it is gracious, and sure I am it is
right, thus to keep up intercourse with heaven. You and I have our
Samuels; I mean our </span><span class="c6">asked blessings,</span><span
class="c5"> whether in children, or in other providences. Oh! for grace,
while receiving mercies, to make those mercies the memorandums of the
great Giver! If what we ask from God in prayer, we give back again
</span><span class="c6">to</span><span class="c5"> God in praise, and in
the stream of creature enjoyments, find a tenfold relish in them, from
living upon the Creator fulness; then we shall find cause to call many a
blessing Samuel, because "it hath been asked," and often given unasked,
</span><span class="c6">of the Lord.</span></p>

7—Morning—Revelation 7:16</h3>
<p>"They shall hunger no more."—Rev, vii. 16.</p>
<p>My soul! contemplate for a moment, before thou enterest upon the
concerns of time and sense, in the claims of the world, the blessed
state of the redeemed above. They are at the fountain-head of happiness,
in their station, in their service, in their society, in their
provision, in their everlasting exemption from all want, and above all,
in the presence of God and the Lamb. "They shall hunger no more." Sweet
thought! Let me this day anticipate as many of the blessed properties of
it as my present state in Jesus will admit. If Jesus be my home, my
residence, my dwelling-place, will not the hungerings of my soul find
supply? Yes, surely. A life of faith on the Son of God, is a satisfying
life, under all the changes of the world around. Finding Jesus, I find
sustenance in him, and therefore do not hunger for ought besides him.
"Thou art my hiding-place,"said one of old; and my soul finds occasion
to adopt the same language. And He that is' my hiding-place, is also my
food and my nourishment. In Jesus there is both food and a fence; there
is fruit, as well as a shadow; and the fulness of Jesus needs vent in
the wants of his people, for the pouring forth of his all-sufficiency.
My soul, cherish this thought to the full. If thy hunger be really for
Jesus, and him only, then will thy hunger be abundantly supplied in his
communication. As long as I look at my wants, without an eye to Jesus, I
shall be miserable. But if I consider those wants and that emptiness
purposely appointed for the pouring out of his fulness, they will appear
as made for the cause of happiness. Jesus keeps up the hungering, that
he may have the blessedness OF supplying them; he keeps his children
empty that he may fill them, and that his fulness may be in request
among them. So far, therefore, is my hungering from becoming a source of
sorrow, it furnisheth out a source of holy joy. I should never be
straitened in myself, when I am not straitened in Jesus. Nay, it would
be a sad token of distance from Jesus if a sense of want was lessened.
While, on the other hand, the best proof' I can have of nearness to
Jesus, and living upon him, is, when my enjoyment of Jesus discovers new
and increasing wants, and excites an holy hungering for his supplying
them. By and by I shall get home, and then at the fountain head of
rapture and delight, all hungering and wants will be done away, in the
full and everlasting enjoyment of God and the Lamb!</p>

7—Evening—Hebrews 11:11</h3>
<p>"Because she judged him faithful who had promised."—Heb. xi. 11.</p>
<p>I admire what the Holy Ghost hath here recorded of Sarah's faith.
After what we read of the weakness of her faith at first, in the history
to which this refers, I cannot but rejoice in the recovery of the great
mother in Israel, through grace; and read with very much pleasure, this
honourable testimony, which the Holy Ghost himself hath given of her.
And I admire yet more, the grace and goodness of the Eternal Spirit, in
causing it to be handed down to the church, among the list of such
worthies, and desire to bless his holy name for this scripture. And
while I bless God for the memorial, I pray him to give me a spirit of
wisdom, to improve it to my own furtherance in faith. The faith of
Sarah, like that of her husband's, was the more illustrious, from the
seeming impossibilities which lay in the way of the accomplishment of
God's promise. For what the Lord engaged to do, was contrary to the
whole course of nature. But what was that to Sarah? All she had to do,
was to consider the promise; and keep an eye upon the Almighty Promiser.
If there are difficulties in the way, that is God's business, and not
mine, might Sarah say. How the Lord will bring it to pass, is with him,
and not with me: I have no concern with that. My province is to believe;
it is God's to work. Here was an act of illustrious faith! and the
sequel of Sarah's history, shews how well founded it was. But the Holy
Ghost explains the subject, and shews how it was accomplished; "because
she judged him faithful who had promised." Now, my soul, see to it, that
thou make the same grand cause the foundation of thy faith; namely,
Jehovah's faithfulness; and, depend upon it, every promise of the
gospel, even Jesus, with all his fulness, thou mayest, as well as Sarah,
rely upon; and thou wilt be always able to do it, as long as thou makest
the same perfection of Jehovah thy confidence: "because she judged him
faithful that promised." While I rest upon his faithfulness, I rest upon
the Rock of Ages, which can never give way: and every difficulty, or
seeming impossibility, which comes between the promise of a faithful
God, and the accomplishment of that promise, hath no more to do with the
thing itself, than the tide hath with unsettling the rock; but will,
like the tide, soon ebb, and withdraw, and leave the ground dry. Oh! the
blessedness of judging Him faithful, who hath promised.</p>

8—Morning—Haggai 2:19</h3>
<p>"From this day will I bless thee."—Hag, ii. 19.</p>
<p>My soul, what day is the memorable day to thee from whence commenced
thy blessings? No doubt from everlasting the Lord hath blessed his
people in Jesus. But the commencement of thy personal enjoyment of those
blessings, was at the time the Lord graciously laid the foundation of
his spiritual temple in thee; the blessed, the gracious, the auspicious,
the happy day, when the Lord made thee willing in the day of his power?
Oh! blessed day, never, never to be forgotten! A day of light; when the
light of Jesus first broke in upon me. A day of life; when the Lord
Jesus quickened my poor soul, which before was laying dead in trespasses
and sins. A day of love; when his love first was made known to my soul,
who so loved me as to give his dear and ever-blessed Son for me: and his
love was sweetly manifested, who so loved me as to give himself for me.
A day of the beginning of victory, over death and hell, and the grave. A
day of liberty; when the Lord Jesus opened my prison doors and brought
me out. A day of wonder, love and praise; when my eyes first saw the
King in his beauty, and my whole soul was overpowered in the
contemplation of the grace, the glory, the beauty, the loveliness, the
suitableness, the all-sufficiency of his glorious Person and glorious
work. A day, Oh what dear name shall I term it to be? A day of grace, a
jubilee, a salvation day! the day of my espousals to Jesus, and of the
gladness of my Redeemer's heart! And, my soul, did thy God, did thy
Jesus say, that from that day he would bless thee? And hath he not done
it? Oh, yes, yes; beyond all conception of blessing. He hath blessed
thee in thy basket and thy store. All the blessings, even in temporal
mercies, which were all forfeited in Adam, are now sweetly restored, and
blessed, and sanctified, in Jesus: nay, even thy very crosses have
the-curse taken out of them by thy Jesus; and thy very tears have the
spiced wine of the pomegranate. And as to spiritual blessings, God thy
Father hath blessed thee with all in his dear Son. Thy Father hath made
over himself, in Jesus, with all his love and favour. And Jesus is
thine, with all his fulness, sweetness, all-sufficiency. And God the
Spirit, with all his gracious influences and comforts. And the present
enjoyment of these unspeakable mercies becomes the sure earnest of
blessings which are eternal. Jesus himself hath declared, that it is the
Father's own gracious will that he should give eternal life to as many
as the Father hath given him; and therefore eternal life must be the
sure portion of all his redeemed. "He that believeth in the Son hath
indeed everlasting life; and Jesus will raise him up at the last day."
Pause, my soul, and view the vast heritage to which thou art begotten
from the day of thy new birth in Jesus, Oh! most gracious Father, let me
never lose sight of those sweet words, nor the feeling sense of my
interest in them, in which thou hast said, "From this day will I bless
thee."</p>

8—Evening—Psalm 38</h3>
<p>"A psalm of David to bring to remembrance."—Ps. xxxviii. in the
title.</p>
<p>This psalm, as well as the seventieth, is particularly marked in the
title, and distinguished from every other; and it will be worth while to
seek into the cause. A great light will be thrown upon it, if we connect
with this title, the character of the great author, under whose
inspiration David, as the penman, wrote it: I mean, that sweet and
blessed office of the Holy Ghost, the Remembrancer of the Lord Jesus.
"He shall teach you"(saith the Lord Jesus, when describing the blessed
Spirit in his offices) "all things, and bring all things to your
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you:" John xiv. 26. Now, if
this psalm be found, on examination, to be speaking much of the person
and character of Christ, ought it not, when read under the divine
teaching of its Almighty Author, to act as a psalm to bring to
remembrance, how Jesus thus suffered, thus groaned, bled, and died for
his people? He it was, as this psalm represents, whose lovers and
friends stood aloof from him, in his sorrows; for in the trying hour,
all his disciples forsook him and fled: and he was the only person of
whom it could be said, that as a deaf man who heard not, and as a dumb
man who opened not his mouth, so Jesus stood, as a lamb before her
shearers, when in the hall of Pilate, he was accused and condemned
without opening his mouth. If then the great design of this psalm is to
bring to remembrance the Redeemer, in those solemn seasons; shall we
make application of the contents of it to David, king of Israel, and
overlook David's Lord? Oh! thou great and divine Remembrancer of the
Lord Jesus! I beseech thee, thou matchless Instructor! to cause every
thing, and every incident, to call my poor forgetful heart to remember
its Lord! Lord, I blush to think how men of the world feel interested in
the most minute concerns of the histories of any characters of supposed
eminence, which in former ages have lived among them; every memorandum
of them that can be gathered, is treasured up with more avidity than
gold: if a letter, or the hand-writing can be found, how they expressed
themselves, or how their hours were engaged, with all, or any of the
little events which marked their lives; Oh! what attention it gains in
the world! But, as if to shew their indiffercnce to him, who, strictly
speaking, is the only one worthy regard, what heart is alive to the ever
blessed Jesus? Do thou, I beseech thee, thou eternal Spirit, in this
gracious office of thine, as the Remembrancer of my Lord, make this
psalm, as oft as I read it, a psalm to bring Jesus to remembrance in all
his endearments: and also cause all thy sacred word to minister to this
one great end! Here let me learn a lesson from men of the world; and
while they feel rapture in the me, morandums and reliques of poor
sinners, whose places know them no more; let my soul delight in the
views his sacred word affords concerning Jesus. 'Thus Jesus spak,' I
would say: and 'thus he stood;' and 'thus he was encircled by the
astonished multitude, who witnessed the gracious words which proceeded
out of his mouth.' Every incident then in his divine life, will be as a
psalm to bring to remembrance; and I shall enjoy a thousand things, when
the Holy Ghost, as his Remembrancer, brings them forth to view, which,
without his gracious office and word, would be lost to my poor forgetful
mind.</p>

9—Morning—Ephesians 2:13</h3>
<p>"But now in Christ Jesus, ye, who sometimes were afar off, are made
nigh by the blood of Christ."—Eph. ii. 13.</p>
<p>Of all the vast alterations made upon our nature by grace, that which
is from death to life seems to be the greatest. I do not think the
change would be as great, if Jesus were to make a child of God, after
his conversion, at once an archangel, as when, by his blessed Spirit he
quickens the sinner, dead in trespasses and sins, and brings him into
grace. My soul, contemplate the sweet thought this morning, that it may
lead thee, with thy hymn of praise, to all precious Jesus! First then,
my soul, think where you then stood, before this vast act of grace had
quickened you. You stood on the very confines of hell—unawakened,
unregenerate, uncalled, without God, and without Christ. Supposing the
Lord had not saved you; supposing a sickness unto death had, by his
command, taken you; supposing that any one cause had been commissioned
to sign your death-warrant while in this state; where must have been
your portion? And yet consider, my soul; how many nights and days did
you live in this unconscious, unconcerned state? Oh! who, in this view
of the thought, can look back without having the eye brimful of tears,
and the heart bursting with love and thankfulness! Go on, my soul, and
contemplate the subject in another point of view; and pause in the
pleasing thought, "where you now stand." You are now, saith the
apostle," made nigh by the blood of Christ." You that was an enemy to
God by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his
flesh, through death, to present you holy, and unblamable, and
unreprovable, in his sight. And now, my soul, if death should come, it
is but the messenger to glory. Precious, blessed thought! And Oh, how
much more precious, blessed Jesus, the Author of it! Advance, my soul,
one step more in this sweet subject, and pleasingly consider, where you
soon shall be. Paul answereth; "So shall we be ever with the Lord."
"Ever with the Lord!" Who can write down the full amount of this
blessedness? "Ever with the Lord!" Here we are, in Jesus, interested in
all that belongs to Jesus; but there, we shall be also with Jesus. Here
we see him but as through a glass darkly; but there, face to face. Here,
even the views we have of him by faith, are but glimpses only—short and
rare, compared to our desires; but there, we shall see him in reality,
in substance, and unceasingly, the precious, glorious, God-man Christ
Jesus. Here, our sins, though pardoned, yet dim our view, by reason of
their effects; there, we shall for ever have lost them, and see, and
know, even as we are known. And have these blessed changes taken place
in my soul; and all by thee, thou gracious, precious, Holy One of
Israel? Oh for grace to love thee, to live to thee, to be looking out
for thee, dearest Jesus, that I may be counting every parting breath,
every beating pulse, as one the less, to bring me nearer and nearer to
Jesus, who is my everlasting home, and will ere long, be my
never-ceasing portion and happiness in eternity.—Hallelujah!</p>

9—Evening—John 9:7</h3>
<p>"The pool of Siloam."—John ix. 7.</p>
<p>It was a very gracious account given by the Holy Ghost, in the
writings of his servants the prophets, that in the last days, meaning
gospel days, "living waters should go forth of Jerusalem;" and saith the
Lord, "it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth which moveth,
whithersoever the river shall come, shall live;" Ezek. xlvii. 9. And in
the day of Christ's flesh, we find Jesus giving life wheresoever he
came: and not unfrequently, as if to testify the sovereignty of his
power, he communicated his blessing in this life-giving principle of
himself, by means altogether, to outward view, unpromising. The clay
applied to the eyes of one born blind, and the pool of Siloam, are both
directly in point. It is just so, blessed Jesus, that I would have
recourse to ordinances and means of grace, and when I attend, I would
desire to pass over them to the enjoyment of thyself, and the gracious
influences of thy Holy Spirit. Were the: pool of Siloam always thus
attended, and the several maladies of thy people thus brought before
thee, that while using the means, we had an eye to the end, how should
we find the diseased that were sent, returning healed. The imagination
can hardly conceive any thing more interesting, than to behold souls
under their different distresses, thus coming to the pool of Siloam, and
thus receiving Jesus in the use-of it. Am I faint? "He giveth power to
the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaseth strength." Is
another walking in darkness and having no light? Jesus saith, "I am the
light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness."
Are our bones dried, like the bones in the valley, "and our hope lost:
are we cut off for our parts?"(Ezek. xxxvii. 11.) Behold, saith the Lord
God, "I will open your graves, O my people, and cause you to come up out
of your graves." And how doth the Lord accomplish it? He saith, "I am
the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live; and he that liveth and believeth in me shall
never die." Are they void of faith? Jesus is the Author and giver of
faith. Are they backward to repentance? Jesus is exalted as a Prince and
a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins." Have
they backslidden? Jesus saith, "I will heal their backsliding, I will
love them freely." In short, at the pool of Siloam, neither the water
nor the clay are the objects of faith, but he that sends to the pool:
and while we lay our wants over against his fulness, and consider, in
our need, the very suitability there is in that need for the display of
Christ's grace in the supply, this is the very way of following up the
divine appointments. And as every poor sinner is made blessed in
receiving from Jesus: so Jesus is made glorious in giving out of his
fulness; and the gracious purpose of salvation is-answered in the
comfort of the sinner, the glory of the Saviour, and the everlasting
praise of Jehovah, in the wonders of redemption! My soul! let thine
evening meditation be thus sweet in viewing the pool of Siloam!</p>

words of thy God. Wherefore should the fear of man bring a snare? How
much needless anxiety should I spare myself, could I but live, amidst
all my changeable days and changeable circumstances, upon my
unchangeable God. Now, mark what thy God saith of thy unreasonable and
ill-grounded fears—"Where is the fury of the oppressor?" Can he take
from thee thy Jesus? No! Shouldest thou lose all thy earthly comforts,
Jesus ever liveth, and Jesus is thine. Can he afflict thee, if God saith
no? That is impossible. Neither men nor devils can oppress without his
permission. And sure enough thou art, thy God and Saviour will never
allow any thing to thy hurt; for all things must work for good. And
canst thou lessen the oppressor's fury by anxious fears? Certainly not.
Thou mayest, my soul, harrass thyself and waste thy spirits, but never
lessen the fury of the enemy thereby. And wherefore, then, shouldest
thou crowd the uncertain evils, and the </span><span class="c6">may

day's warfare, when, by only waiting for the morrow, and casting all thy
care upon Jesus, who careth for thee, his faithfulness is engaged to be

Samuel 2:25</h3>
<p>"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him. But if a
man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him?"—1 Sam. ii. 25.</p>
<p>It is a very solemn thing to behold a trembling convicted malefactor,
when standing before an earthly tribunal, although the judge is of the
same nature with himself: for every thing is solemn, earnest, and
impartial. But what is the awfulness of a court of human judicature,
compared to that day, in which a wholeworld, all found guilty before
God, shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ? In this life, there
is, for the most part, somewhat to mitigate, and to excite hope in the
worst of cases: some tender-hearted friend, some kind neighbour, some
feeling relation, will be found to arise, to soften, if not able to
relieve, the guilty man's distress. But at that tribunal, where none can
plead, and where all hearts are open, what shall be found to stop the
overwhelming horrors of the condemned?—Pause, my soul, over the view,
for it is solemn. If one man sin against another, thus breaking the law,
the judge shall Judge him; and who is the judge but Jesus? Here he that
is the Judge, is also the Advocate of his people; yea, their surety,
their law-fulfiller; so that, as the apostle was commissioned to tell
the church, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins, "1 John
ii. 1, 2. Precious thought! soul-supporting consolation! To all the sins
and offences, both against God and man, the believer may plead the blood
and righteousness of Jesus, as the law-fulfiller and ransom paid for
sin. But if a man sin against the Lord himself, by rejecting this
counsel of God against his own soul, who then shall entreat for him? For
the only advocate, he slights; the only propitiation, he disclaims; and
as there is salvation in no other, and there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sin, to whom, in that awful day of God, will he look; or who but
Jesus could take up his cause? Oh! ye that know not Christ, or ye that
slight him, think, before it be too late, what paleness, dread, and
horror, must arrest that soul, which, when weighed in the balances,
shall be found wanting! Cherish, my soul, the blessedness of thy hope,
which is founded wholly on the Mediator's righteousness; and resteth on
what can never fail of acceptance, because founded both on the merit of
Christ, and God the Father's own appointment; redemption in the blood of
the Lamb, and being made accepted in the beloved.</p>

<p>And behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord! if
thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand and
touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy
was cleansed."—Matt, viii. 2, 3.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul, in the instance of this leper, thine own
circumstances. What he was in body, such wert thou in soul. As his
leprosy made him loathsome and offensive before men, so thy polluted
soul made thee odious in the sight of God! He would not have sought a
cure, had he not been conscious of his need of it. Neither wouldest thou
ever have looked to Jesus, had he not convinced thee of thy helplessness
and misery without him. Moreover, he would not, though convinced how
much he needed healing, have sought that mercy from Jesus, had he not
been made sensible of Jesus's ability to the cure. Neither wouldest thou
ever have come to Jesus, hadst thou not been taught who Jesus is, and
how fully competent to deliver thee. The poor leper did not doubt
whether Jesus was able: though he rather feared that ability might not
be exercised towards him. His prayer was, not if thou art able, but,
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." Now here, my soul, I
hope, thy faith, through grace, exceeds the Jewish leper. Surely thou
both knowest Jesus's power and Jesus's disposition to save thee.
Unworthy and undeserving as thou art, yet his grace is not restrained by
thy undeservings, no more than it was first constrained by thy merit.
His love, his own love, his free love, is the sole rule of his mercy
towards his children, and not their claims, for they have none, but in
his free grace and the Father's everlasting mercy. Cherish these
thoughts, my soul, at all times, for they are most sweet and precious.
But are these all the blessed things which arise out of the view of the
poor leper's case? Oh, no; the most delightful part still remains in the
contemplation of Jesus's mercy to the poor petitioner, and the very
gracious manner the Son of God manifested in the bestowing of it. He not
only healed him, and did it immediately, but with that tenderness which
distinguished his character and his love to poor sinners. Jesus put
forth his hand and touched him; touched a leper! even so, precious Lord,
deal by me. Though polluted and unclean, yet condescend to put forth,
thine hand and touch me also. Put forth thy blessed Spirit. Come, Lord,
and dwell in me, abide in me, and rule and reign over me. Be thou my
God, my Jesus, my Holy One, and make me thine for ever.</p>

11—Evening—Song of Solomon 6:4</h3>
<p>"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah; comely as Jerusalem."—Song
vi. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> And what was Tirzah? One of the cities in the lot
of Manasseh, Joshua xii. 6, 24. and no doubt, as Judea was the glory of
all lands, Tirzah, which was a part of it, was lovely. And the
comeliness of that highly favoured spot, Jerusalem, is celebrated in the
sacred Song; "In the mountain of his holiness, "saith the Psalmist,
"beautiful for situation, and the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion,
"Ps. xlviii. 1, 2. And is Christ's church, in her Lord's eye, thus
beautiful? Yes! he himself saith she is: and, by consequence, every
individual member of her is so, which constitutes her one body. Pause,
my soul, over this account, and let thine everlasting meditation dwell
upon the pleasing subject. Thou art mourning continually over thine
infirmities; thou feelest what Paul felt, and thou groanest under the
same burden as he groaned under: and, indeed, the consciousness of the
remains of indwelling sin is enough to make the souls of the redeemed go
softly all their days. But while thus conscious that thyself thou hast
nothing that is lovely, do not overlook the loveliness which the
righteousness of Christ, justifylng his people, imparts to all their
persons. Zion is said to be the perfection of beauty; and so she is in
the eyes of God our Father, being the body of Christ, and made so in his
beauty. What Jesus is in God's sight, such must be his people. For
Christ, as head of his church, is the fulness that filleth all in all.
If, in my soul, thou wert looking for any thing in thyself that was
amiable or beautiful to recommend thee to Jesus, or to justify thee
before God; then, indeed, thou mightest exclaim with the prophet: "Woe
is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, "Isa. vi. 5.
But if Jesus hath touched thy lips, and taken away thine iniquity, and
thy sin is purged; then art thou all fair in him, and accepted by God
the Father in him, the beloved: and Jesus saith to thee, and of thee,
"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem." See to
it henceforth, that thou art never losing sight of thy oneness with
Christ, thy acceptance in Christ, and the loveliness that thou art
deriving </span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> Christ.
And while thou art daily lamenting that a soul united to Jesus should
still carry about such a body of sin and death as thou dost, which
harrasseth and afflicteth thy soul; yet never, never forget that thou
art now looking up to the throne of grace for acceptance as thou art in
Jesus, and not as thou art in thyself; and comfort thyself with this
pleasing consideration, that ere long thou wilt be openly presented
before a throne of glory, "not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing, but holy and without blemish before him in love."</span></p>

12—Morning—Hebrews 6:12</h3>
<p>"Followers of them, who through faith and patience, inherit the
promises."—Heb, vi. 12.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> How gracious is the Holy Ghost, in not only holding
forth to the people of Jesus the blessedness and certainty of the
promises, but opening to our view multitudes, who are now in glory, in
the full enjoyment of them. My soul, dost thou ask how they lived, when
upon earth, in the full prospect, before that they were called upon to
enter heaven for the full participation of them? Hear what the blessed
Spirit saith concerning it in this sweet scripture. "It was through
faith and patience." Now observe how these blessed principles manifested
themselves. Another part of scripture explains—"they all died in faith,
not having received the promises; but having seen them afar off, and
were persuaded of them, and embraced them." Now this is the whole sum
and substance of the believer's life: </span><span class="c6">he sees
them afar off,</span><span class="c5"> as Abraham did the day of
Christ—as David, who had the same enjoyment in a believing view, with
which his whole soul was satisfied: for he saith, "it was all his
salvation, and all his desire; "a covenant which he rested upon, "as
ordered in all things, and sure." Pause, my soul, over this, and ask
within, are your views thus firmly founded? What, though the day of
Christ's second coming be far off, or nigh, doth thy faith realize the
blessed things belonging to it as certain, and as sure as God is truth.
Pause, and see that such is thy faith—then go on. The faithful, who row
inherit the promises, end which the Holy Ghost bids thee to follow, not
only saw with the eye of faith, the things of Jesus afar off, but "were
persuaded of them;" that is, were as perfectly satisfied of their
existence and reality, as if they were already in actual possession.
Pause here again, and say, is this thy faith? Are you perfectly
persuaded "that God was, in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
not imputing their trespasses unto them?" Are you convinced that it is
God's design, God's plan, God's grace, God's love, God's mercy, in all
that concerns Jesus? Art thou convinced that God's glory is concerned in
the glory of Jesus, and that every poor sinner gives glory to God in
believing the record that God hath given of bis Son? Dost thou, my soul,
believe heartily, cordially, fully, joyfully, believe these precious
things; nay, that in fact, it is the only possible way a poor sinner can
give glory to God, in looking, up to him as God, in giving him the
credit of God, and taking his word as God concerning his dear Son Jesus
Christ? Dost thou, my soul, set thy seal to these things? Then art thou
"persuaded of the truths of God, "as the patriarchs were "who saw them
afar off." Once more—the faithful, whom the Holy Ghost calls upon thee
to follow, embraced them also, as well as were persuaded of them. They
clasped, </span><span class="c6">by faith,</span><span class="c5"> Jesus
in their arms, as really and as truly as Simeon did in </span><span
class="c6">substance.</span><span class="c5"> Their love to Jesus, and
their interest </span><span class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> Jesus,
their acquaintance by faith with Jesus, were matters of certainty,
reality, delight; and their whole souls were, day by day, so
familiarized in the unceasing meditation, that they walked by faith with
Jesus while here below, as now, by sight, they are with him above in
glory. Pause, my soul! Is this thy faith? Then, surely, Jesus is
precious, and thou art indeed "the follower of them-who now, through
faith and patience, inherit the promises." And ere long, like them, thou
shalt see him whom thy soul loveth, and dwell with him for
ever!</span></p>

12—Evening—Psalm 75:10</h3>
<p>"Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee; the remainder of wrath
shalt thou restrain."—Psalm lxxvi. 10.</p>
<p>My soul! thou art returned from the exercises of the day;. exercises
which sometimes are sharp and trying: come now into the pavilion and
retirings of thy God in Christ, and take with thee this sweet scripture,
and under his gracious teachings, see what beauties, by way of comfort,
it affords. The Holy Ghost saith, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise
the Lord." Pause, and consider in how many ways this blessed scripture
proves itself. How often is the wrath of man made to minister to the
happiness of God's people! How often do they become the unconscious
ministers of producing the very reverse of what they intended: and where
they designed evil to the saints of God, there good is found to come!
When the Lord makes our friends, in the sweet endearments of society,
promote our welfare, and we find blessings spring out of the thousand,
and ten thousand charities of life; in providences, in helps,
assistances, and the like, in which we minister by his appointment one
to another; we do not so often trace the divine hand; and from the
commonness of the blessing, lose sight of the direction whence it comes.
But when the Lord, at any time, makes our enemies, and the enemies of
our God and of his Christ, accomplish the secret purposes of his holy
will; and those acts of theirs, which were evidently meant by them to
distress, prove the very cause of joy; then we discern how the Lord
overrules every thing to his glory, and his people's welfare. Here the
Lord speaks in a loud voice, as in that sweet scripture, "In that day
sing ye unto her, a vineyard of red wine. I, the Lord, do keep it. I
will water it every moment, lest any hurt it; I will keep it night and
day." Isaiah xxvii. 2, 3. My soul! learn from henceforth to be on the
watch-tower, as the prophet was, looking for the evidences of these
things. They will be very blessed, when at any time they are discovered;
and, depend upon it, they are more frequent, than with thy poor
thoughtless and inattentive mind thou art apt to suppose. Had not the
brethren of Joseph sold him for a slave, how would he afterwards have
arisen to be governor in Egypt? Had not Pharoah oppressed Israel, how
would their cries to, God have called Him forth to their rescue? Had not
that monster of iniquity pursued the people of God to the Red Sea, how
would Israel have seen their foes dead on the shore? Nay, ascending to
an infinitely higher and more momentous matter than all these, or every
other in history put together, I would ask, had not the wrath of man
nailed Jesus to the cross, how, my soul, wouldest thou, and all the
ransomed church of Christ, have found redemption in his blood? Oh! for
grace, ever to keep this in remembrance. Never, surely, did the wrath of
men praise Jehovah in any equal degree, or was so made to minister
to-the divine glory! Precious, precious Jesus! I beseech thee, gracious
Lord, preserve alive in my soul, this contemplation of man's malice
ministering to God's praise; that in all my little exercises here below,
my soul may be stayed and comforted under them. And when at any time the
enemy frowns, bad men afflict, the proud scorn, or the mighty of the
earth would trample me under their feet, until in the bitterness of my
heart, I cry out, "hath God forgotten to be gracious?" O for grace to
cast one look at the cross of my Lord, and there read the whole
explained: "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee; the remainder of
wrath shalt thou restrain."</p>

<p>"Oh! thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt."—Matt, xiv.
31.</p>
<p>My soul, how sweet is it to eye Jesus in all things, and to be
humbled in the recollection of his compassions to thy unaccountable
instances of unbelief, after the many, nay, continued and daffy
experiences, which thou hast had of his love and faithfulness. And doth
thy Jesus speak to thee this day, in those expostulating words, "Oh!
thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" What answer wilt thou
return? Is there any thing in thy life to justify, or even to apologize
for doubting? Look back - behold thy God and Father's grace, and mercy,
and love;—a Saviour so rich, so compassionate, so answering all wants,
in spirituals, temporals, and eternals; - a blessed Spirit, so
condescending to teach, to lead, and by his influences to be continually
with thee! Surely, a life like thine, crowded with mercies, blessings
upon blessings, and one miracle of grace followed by another - wherefore
shouldest thou doubt? What shall I say to thee, Oh! thou that art the
hope of Israel, and the Saviour thereof? Lord, give me to believe, and
help thou mine unbelief. I beseech thee, my God and Saviour, give me
henceforth faith to trust thee when I cannot trace thee: give me tohang
upon thee, when the ground of all sensible comforts seems sinking under
my feet. I would cling to the faithfulness of my God in Christ, and
throw my poor arms around thee, thou blessed Jesus, when all things
appear the most dark and discouraging. And thus, day by day, living a
life of faith and whole dependance upon thy glorious Person and thy
glorious work, pressing after more sensible communion with thee, and
more imparted strength and grace from thee, until at length, when thou
shalt call me home from a life of faith to a life of sight - then,
precious Jesus, would I say to thee, with my dying-breath, 'Oh! present
me, washed in thy blood, and clothed in thy righteousness, among the
whole body of thy glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing, but that I may be without blame before thee in love.'</p>

13—Evening—Acts 16:14</h3>
<p>"Whose heart-the Lord opened."—Acts xvi. 14.</p>
<p>It is always blessed to trace mercies to their source! And blessed
when, through grace, we are enabled to give God his glory, and not put
down to man's merit what wholly originates in God's grace. The opening
of the heart can only be the province of Him that made it. Renewing
work, as well as creating work, is his. He that hath the key of David,
is he alone "that openeth, and none shutteth; and shutteth, and none
openeth." What a beautiful illustration hath the Holy Ghost given the
church of this precious truth, in the instance of this woman, whose
heart the Lord opened! We are told in her history, that she was of the
city of Thyatira, a place remote from Philippi, where this sovereign act
of mercy was shewn towards her. How long she had remained in a state of
unrenewed nature, or what predisposing providence it was that brought
her to Philippi, with other circumstances which we might have thought
interesting to inquire after, we are not informed: the grand feature in
her character is summed up in this short, but blessed account, "whose
heart the Lord opened." The Holy Ghost hath indeed recorded her name and
occupation, by way of making this testimony concerning her: - "a certain
woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple." Behold, my soul! what blessed
instruction ariseth out of it, for thine evening's meditation. What
honourable mention is made of her, from this one blessed act, which the
Lord wrought upon her. Poor and inconsiderable as she was in herself;
small and of no reputation, yet her name is in the book of life! Pause,
and contemplate the rich mercy which the Lord hath also accomplished in
thee. Hath not he that opened Lydia's heart, opened thine? And is it not
his province also, that first opened it by his grace, to keep it open by
the daily influences of his Holy Spirit? Is it not his to renew, to
refresh, to comfort, to strengthen, and to confirm unto the end? And
wilt thou not, my soul, with the close of day, and the opening of the
morning, look up for these precious manifestations? Lord! do thou open
mine eyes, mine heart, my whole soul, to the enjoyment of these gracious
renewed visits of thy love: and let no night or morning pass, without
receiving fresh and increasing evidences from my Lord, that Christ hath
both opened my heart, and is "formed in my heart, the hope of
glory!"</p>

14—Morning—John 17:19</h3>
<p>"And for their sakes I sanctify myself."—John xvii. 19.</p>
<p>Let thy morning thoughts, my soul, be directed to this sweet view of
thy Saviour. Behold thy Jesus presenting himself as the surety of his
people before God and the Father. Having now received the call and
authority of God the Father, and being fitted with a body suited to the
service of a Redeemer, here see him entering upon the vast work; and in
those blessed words, declaring the cause of it - "I sanctify myself."
Did Jesus mean that he made himself more holy for the purpose? No,
surely: for that was impossible. But by Jesus sanctifying himself, must
be understood (as the Nazarite from the womb, consecrated, set apart,
dedicated to the service to which the Father had called him), a
voluntary offering-an holy unblemished sacririce. And observe for whom:
"for their sakes;" not for himself; for he needed it not. The priests
under the law made their offerings, first for themselves, and then for
the people. "But such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; and
who needed not daily, as those high priests, so to offer. For the law
maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the Son is consecrated
for evermore. "My soul, pause over this view of thy Jesus; and when thou
hast duly pondered it, go to the mercy-seat, under the Spirit's leadings
and influences, and there, by faith, behold thy Jesus, in his vesture
dipped in blood, there sanctified, and there appearing in the presence
of God for thee. There plead the dedication of Jesus; for it is of the
Father's own appointment. There tell thy God and Father, (for it is the
Father's glory, when a poor sinner glorifies his dear Son in him) that
He, that Holy One, whom the Father consecrated, and with an oath
confirmed in his high priestly office for ever, appeareth there for
thee. Tell God that thy High Priest's holiness and sacrifice was
altogether holy, pure, without a spot; and both his Person, and his
nature, and offering, clean as God's own righteous law. Tell, my soul,
tell thy God and Father these sacred, solemn truths. And while thou art
thus coming to the mercy-seat, under the leadings of the Spirit, and
wholly in the name and office-work of thy God and Saviour, look unto
Jesus, and call to mind those sweet words, for whose sake that Holy One
sanctified himself; and then drop a petition more before thou comest
from the heavenly court: beg, and pray, and wrestle with the bountiful
Lord for suited strength and grace, that as, for thy sake, among the
other poor sinners of his redemption-love, Jesus sanctified himself, so
thou mayest be able to be separated from every thing but Jesus; and as
thy happiness was Christ's end, so his glory may be thy first and
greatest object. Yes, dearest Jesus, methinks I hear thee say, - Thou
shalt be for me, and not for another: so will I be for thee. Oh! thou
condescending, loving God, "make me thine; that whether I live, I may
live unto the Lord; or whether I die, I may die unto the Lord; so that
living or dying, I may be thine."</p>

Thessalonians 1:10</h3>
<p>"He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in
all them that believe."—2 Thess. i. 10.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Among a thousand wonders that will be unfolded
before the astonished world, at the great day of God, to call up the
unceasing praises of the church of Christ to all eternity, there are two
very blessed events which will take place, and which this scripture
records; the one is, how Jesus will be glorified in his own sacred
person, in the view of his redeemed, when all his beauties are then
displayed; and the </span><span class="c6">other</span><span class="c5">
is, how Jesus will be glorified </span><span class="c6">in
them,</span><span class="c5"> from the saving change which his grace
hath wrought in them. Let thine evening meditation, my soul, be upon
both. And first, think how Jesus, thy Jesus, will then appear. He hath
indeed been always known to thee, since he was first revealed to thee by
grace, as wonderful; and every act of his towards thee, hath fully
answered to this name. For in all his perfections, offices, characters,
and relations; in all things concerning and relating to him, every view
of him is wonderful. But He that is now known by faith, will then become
the object of sight; and think, my soul, what an object of sight will it
be! Never, but in the person of Jesus, can there be any thing presented
to the view of men, or of angels, of equal glory! God and man in one
person, can only be found in Christ. And God dwelling in flesh, is only
rendered capable by that union, and through that medium, of being seen.
And think, if it be possible, how glorious, how unspeakably glorious,
the human nature of Christ must be, and is, from its union with the
Godhead: such as no excellency of angels can at all, even in the most
distant degree, resemble. Pause over this contemplation; for such is thy
Jesus! and such will he appear, when he shall come to be glorified in
his saints, and mired in all that believe. When thou hast fully feasted
thyself, (as far as thy poor unripe faculties can take in the
blessedness of it,) by dwelling upon the contemplation of Jesus, as he
is, and as he will then appear, in his own glorious person; go on, and
consider that glory that shall be revealed of Jesus, in the saving
change which he hath wrought in his people, whereby he will be admired
in all them that believe. Oh! what a flood of glory will pour in upon
the soul, and what endless praises will go forth to the great Author of
the unspeakable mercy, when the vast volume comes to be opened and
explained, of what Jesus hath wrought </span><span
class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> them; what he hath communicated
</span><span class="c6">to</span><span class="c5"> them; what
everlasting blessings he hath procured </span><span
class="c6">for</span><span class="c5"> them; and what glory, as their
great Mediator he will have </span><span class="c6">by</span><span
class="c5"> them, through all the incalculable periods of the eternal
world, in their living </span><span class="c6">upon him</span><span
class="c5"> and </span><span class="c6">to</span><span class="c5"> him,
and </span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> him deriving
all the accessions of light and life, and glory and joy, for ever and
ever! My soul! never, never lose sight of these blessed views: but add
to that glorious account, that sweet testimony of Jesus, concerning this
great day of God to his people: "At that day ye shall know that I am in
my Father, and ye in me, and I in you." - John xiv. 20.</span></p>

Samuel 7:18-19</h3>
<p><span class="c5">"Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD.
And he said, Who am I, O LORD GOD! and what is my house, that thou hast
brought me hitherto? And is this the manner of man, O LORD
GOD</span><span class="c7">?</span><span class="c5">”—2 Sam. vii. 18,
19.</span></p>
<p>The language of David, under the overwhelming views he had of divine
goodness, as it concerned himself, is suited to the case of every child
of God, as he may trace that goodness in his own history. Surely, every
awakened soul may cry out, under the same impression, - "Who am I, O
Lord God! and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? "My
soul! ponder over the sweet subject, as it concerns thyself. Behold what
manner of love the love of God is from the manner of man. View it in
each Person of the Godhead. What is the highest possible conception any
man can have of the love of God our Father to us? Was it not, when, as
an evidence of the love he had to our nature, he put a robe of that
nature, in its pure and holy state, upon the Person of his dear Son,
when he gave him a body in all points such as ours, sin only excepted,
that he might not only in that body perfect salvation both by his
obedience and death, but also, that he might be our everlasting Mediator
for drawing nigh to the Godhead, first in grace, and then in glory? Tell
me, my soul, what method, in all the stores of Omnipotency, could God
thy Father have adopted to convince thee of his love, as in this sweet
method of his wisdom. God intimates, by this tender process, that he
loveth the human nature which he hath created. And though, to answer the
wise measures af his plan of redemption, he hath not as yet taken all
the persons of his redeemed up to his heavenly court, yet he will have
their glorious Head, their representative there, that he may behold Him,
and accept the whole church in Him, and love them, and bless them in
Him, now, and for ever. Oh! my soul, if this view of thy Father's love
was but always uppermost in thine heart, what a ground of encouragement
would it for ever give thee, to come to thy God and Father in him, and
his mediation; who, while he is one in the divine nature, is one also
with thee in the human, on purpose to bid thee come. And as for thee,
thou blessed Jesus, thy love and thy delights were always with thy
people. From evertasting, thy tendencies of favour have been towards
them; thine whole heart is ours. All thy grace, in being set up as the
covenant-head for us, and all the after-actings of the same grace in
time; all that thou didst then, and all that thou art doing now, - all,
all testify the love of our Jesus. And may I not say to thee, thou dear
Redeemer, as David did, "Is this the manner of man, O Lord God? "Yes, it
is: but it is of the Glory-man, of the God-man, Christ Jesus. And no
less, thou Holy Spirit, whose great work is love and consolation; what a
thought is it to warm my soul into the most awakened contemplation and
delight in the view of thy love, that though thou art of purer eyes than
to behold iniquity, yet dost thou make the very bodies of the redeemed
thy temples, for thine indwelling residence. My soul, do as David did:
go in before the Divine Presence; fall down and adore in the solemn
thought - "Who am I, O Lord God! and what is my Father's house?"</p>

Corinthians 12:2</h3>
<p>"A man in Christ."—2 Cor. xii. 2.</p>
<p>My soul! thy last evening's meditation was sweet, (was it not?) in
contemplating thy Jesus, as glorious in his own person, and as glorified
in his people. Wilt thou add to that subject, for it is part of the
same, for thy present thoughts, what is suggested in this motto, "a man
in Christ?" Dost thou fully enter into the pleasing apprehension of what
the phrase implies? Now, who shall fully describe it; or who is
competent fully to conceive the whole extent of it? "A man in Christ,"
must imply every thing connected with a oneness, an union, a part of
himself; yea, "a life hid with Christ in God." "A man in Christ" is as
much a part in Christ's mystical body, as the head, or hand, or foot, is
a part of that body to which those members belong. Hence, (which is
indeed a sweet part of the subject) every one who is "a man in Christ,"
is, to all intents and purposes, interested in all that belongs to
Christ, as the Christ of God. Hence also, it must as undeniably follow,
that every member of Christ's body, the least, as well as the greatest,
the humblest as well as the highest, becomes a part in him, is equally
united to him, and participates in what belongs to him. The life of
grace here, and the life of glory hereafter, being both derived from
Christ, and enjoyed wholly from an union with him, are therefore equally
enjoyed; just as the smallest leaf or branch united to a tree becomes a
part of that tree, as much as the largest branches. Dost thou enter, my
soul, into an apprehension of these outlines of the subject? Art thou "a
man in Christ," by regeneration, adoption, justification, and grace? Oh!
then, turn over the transporting thought, with holy and unceasing
delight, in thy constant meditation. Calculate, if thou art able, the
blessed inheritance, to which thou art begotten by it, of grace here,
and glory to all eternity. "A man in Christ," is accepted in Christ,
justified in Christ, sanctified in Christ, and must assuredly be
glorified in Christ. Oh! who that thinks of these things, and through
the Holy Ghost is conscious of an interest in them, can suffer the
exercises of a dying world to bring affliction into the soul? What a
life of dignity, is" a man in Christ" brought into! He is brought nigh
unto God, through the blood of the cross. What a state of security is "a
man in Christ" placed in! "Because I live," (saith Jesus) "ye shall live
also." And what an endless prospect of glory, hath "a man in Christ"
opening before him; when Christ hath said, "Father, I will that they
also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may
behold the glory which thou hast given me!" O the unspeakable
blessedness of "a man in Christ!"</p>

16—Morning—Ruth 3:18</h3>
<p>"The man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this
day."—Ruth iii. 18.</p>
<p>Behold! my soul, in this scripture history, some sweet features by
which the disposition of Jesus's love, and the earnestness in his heart
to relieve poor sinners, is strikingly set forth. When a poor sinner is
made acquainted with the Lord Jesus, hath heard of his grace, goes forth
to glean in his fields; at the ordinances of his house, and under the
ministration of his word, lays down at his feet, and prays to be covered
with the skirt of his mantle; Jesus not only takes notice of that poor
seeking sinner, but gives the poor creature to know, by some sweet and
secret whispers of his Holy Spirit, that he is not unacquainted with all
that is in his heart. And when such have lain long, and earnestly
sought, even through the whole night of doubt and fear, until the
morning of grace breaks in upon the soul, yet may they be assured, the
God-man, Christ Jesus, will not rest until that he hath finished the
thing. It is one of the most blessed truths of the gospel, (and do thou,
my soul, see to it, that it is written in thy best and strongest
remembrance to have recourse to, as may be needed, upon every occasion,)
that a seeking sinner is not more earnest to see Jesus, and enjoy him,
than Jesus is to reveal himself to that seeking sinner, and form himself
in the sinner's heart, the hope of glory. For Jesus will not, cannot
cease his love to poor sinners, until the object for which he came to
seek and to save them is fully answered. And it is a thought, my soul,
enough to warm thy coldest moments, that all the hallelujahs of heaven
cannot call off thy Jesus's attention from the necessities of even the
poorest of his little ones here upon earth. In every individual
instance, and in every case, Jesus will not rest until that he hath
finished the thing, as well in the hearts of his people, as in the
world, when he finished the work the Father gave him to do. Yes! Jesus
will not rest until the last redeemed soul is brought home to glory.
Precious consideration, how ought it to endear yet more the preciousness
of the Redeemer!</p>

16—Evening—Isaiah 4:3-4</h3>
<p>"And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that
remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy; even every one that is
written among the living in Jerusalem. When the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood
of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by
the spirit of burning."—Isaiah iv. 3, 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> What a precious scripture is here! and what vast
things are contained in the bosom of it! Mark them down, my soul, one by
one, this evening, and see what of thy personal interest thou canst
trace in the whole. And first, </span><span class="c6">who they
are,</span><span class="c5"> of whom these things are said, namely," the
living in Jerusalem; even every one that is written: and he that is
left, and he that remaineth. "By </span><span
class="c6">living,</span><span class="c5"> and being </span><span
class="c6">written,</span><span class="c5"> can only be meant what the
beloved apostle saith of being "written in the book of life."- Rev,
xiii. 8. And of "him that remaineth," there is, as another apostle
saith, "a remnant according to the election of grace."- Rom, xi. 5.
Hence the Lord Jesus bids his disciples rejoice, not because the spirits
were subject unto them, but because "their names were written in
heaven."- Luke x. 20. Secondly, </span><span class="c6">what they
are;</span><span class="c5"> and we find, that they are called
</span><span class="c6">holy.</span><span class="c5"> This is the great
object of gospel grace; whence the apostle saith," We are bound to give
thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God
hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification
of the Spirit." - 2 Thess. ii. 13. And when God saith, "Be ye holy, for
I am holy," - Levit, xi. 44; his word works by his divine power, in the
new creation of the soul, as he did in the old creation of the earth:
the same efficacy is wrought by the one as by the other. "Let there be
light, and there was light. "Thirdly, </span><span class="c6">What they
shall be.</span><span class="c5"> They shall be cleansed from filth and
uncleanness. There shall be cleansing work, and purging work. Zion shall
be washed, and Jerusalem shall be purged. Sweet and precious scripture,
in proof of that fountain of Jesus's blood, opened in after-days," to
the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for
uncleanness."- Zech, xiii. 1. Fourthly, </span><span class="c6">Who
shall do all this?</span><span class="c5"> - The Lord! this blessed
scripture saith; for He, and he only, can be competent to the great
work. The Creator of the soul must also be its Redeemer. None but the
Lord can take away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purge the
blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof. Precious Jesus! it is thy
blood only, which cleanseth from all sin. Fifthly, </span><span
class="c6">How will the Lord do it?</span><span class="c5"> By the
spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning! Yea, the Holy Ghost,
amidst his manifold gifts and gracious offices, will thus act upon every
one that is written among the living in Jerusalem. "As a spirit of
judgment," he will plead the cause of an injured God and Saviour, with
the sinner's guilty conscience; "convincing of sin, of righteousness,
and of judgment." And he will be a "spirit of burning;" for his word
will act, (as the prophet describes it, Jer. xx. 9.) "as a burning fire,
shut up in the bones," consuming all the day. My soul! what sayest thou
to this solemn but sweet scripture? Hath God the Spirit been to thee all
these? Hath he convinced thee, enlightened thee, and been to thee a
spirit of judgment, and a spirit of burning? Hath he convinced thee of
thy sinful heart, enlightened thy dark heart, burnt, up the lustful
desires of thy corrupt heart, melted thine hard heart, warmed the frozen
affections of thy cold heart, and formed a love there towards the
person, grace, and righteousness of a dear Redeemer? Canst thou set thy
seal to this blessed scripture, that God is true?</span></p>

Peter 1:6</h3>
<p>"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye
are in heaviness through manifold temptations."—I Pet. i, 6.</p>
<p>My soul! it is too difficult a task to flesh and blood, but it is
among the most blessed triumphs of grace, to glory in tribulation, that
the power of Jesus may rest upon the soul. Pause over the subject, and
see whether in the little exercises of thy life, such things are among
thine experiences. A soul must be truly taught of God the Father; truly
acquainted with Jesus, and living near to him; and truly receiving the
sweet and constant influences of the Holy Ghost; when, in the absence of
the streams of all creature comforts, he is solacing himself at the
fountain-head; and, amidst also the fiery darts of temptations! But, my
soul, if this be thy happy portion, thou must have acquired it in the
school of grace. There are some precious marks by which thou wilt
ascertain these things. As, first - I must see that the manifold
temptations, be they of what kind or number they may, are in the
permissions of Jesus must trace the footsteps of Jesus in them, the hand
Jesus directing me through them, the voice of Jesus must hear in them;
and, in short, his sacred Person regulating and ordering all the several
parts of them. If I see his love, his wisdom, his grace, his goodwill,
in all the appointment; whatever heaviness the temptations themselves
induce, there will still be cause left for joy - yea, for great joy.
Moreover, it will be an additional alleviation to soften their pressure,
if through the whole of their exercise, the soul be enabled to keep in
view, that God's glory, and my soul's happiness, will be the sure issue
of them. If I can realize Jesus's presence, as I pass through them, and
interpret, with an application to myself that blessed promise, in which
the Lord saith, "I know the thoughts I think toward you, saith the Lord;
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end;" these
mercies mingled with the trial, will sweeten, and almost take away all
its bitter. And, lastly, to add no more - If, my soul, the Holy Ghost
should lead out thine whole heart upon the Person of Jesus during the
conflict, and by making thee sensible of thy weakness, to take shelter
in him, and to lean altogether upon his strength; so that thou art able
to believe and to depend upon the fulfilment of his promise, when, to
the eye of sense, there doth not seem a way by which that promise may be
fulfilled; these are foundations for rejoicing, and of great rejoicing
too; because they are all out of thyself, and centered in Him, with whom
there is no possibility of change. These are, like the Michtams of
David, precious, golden things. For this is to live upon Jesus, to
rejoice in Jesus, and to find in him a suited strength for every need.
Blessed will be these exercises, my soul, if thou art enabled thus to
act under manifold temptations.</p>

17—Evening—Mark 3:3</h3>
<p>"The man which had the withered hand."—Mark iii. 3.</p>
<p>Surely the man in the jewish synagogue, which had a withered hand,
will, in the history of his disease and cure, furnish me, this evening,
with a very improving meditation. Do thou, blessed Jesus, the great
healer both of soul and body, render it profitable, by thy gracious
instruction to my heart. This poor man had a withered hand, not only
sinew-shrunk, but wasting away. He attended divine worship, for Jesus
found him in the synagogue. But we do not read that he asked the mercy
from Christ. It was Jesus that first looked upon him; and not he on the
Lord Jesus. "Stretch forth thine hand," said the Son of God. Instantly
the poor man found the powers of nature restored, the shrunk sinew
became lengthened, and the hand which had wasted away, was restored.
Pause, my soul! look at the subject as it concerns thyself. How long
didst thou attend the means of grace under a withered soul? And to this
hour, had not Jesus looked on thee, thou wouldest not have looked on
him. Were Jesus to suspend his blessings till sinners had prepared
themselves for them, or deserved them, never would blessings come at
all. And did Jesus speak, as to this poor man, and bid thee live? Did
Jesus command thee to stretch forth thy dead and lifeless soul, and say
unto thee, "I am thy salvation?" Surely, then, thy God's commands
conveyed with them ability; and the same voice which said," stretch
forth thine hand," gave vigour to the hand to lay hold of his mercy. How
sweet is this view of thy impotence, and Jesus's sovereignty! Here we
see that scripture most completely fulfilled: "He sent his word, and
healed them; and delivered them from their destructions. Oh! that .men
would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to
the children of men."- Psalm cvii. 20, 21.</p>

18—Morning—Genesis 48:2</h3>
<p>"And Israel strenghened himself, and sat up on the bed."—Gen, xlviii.
2.</p>
<p>This was an interesting moment in the life, or rather the death, of
the patriarch, and may serve, my soul, to shew what ought to be the
conduct of the believer in his last expiring hours. The imagination can
hardly conceive any situation equally momentous, in every point of view,
both as it concerns a faithful God, a man's own heart, and the church
the dying saint is going to leave behind. What can form a more lovely
sight than a dying saint, sitting up in the bed, (if the Lord permits
the opportunity) and recounting, as Jacob did, the gracious dealings of
the Lord, all the way along the path of pilgrimage - "The God which fed
me," said Jacob," all my life long unto this day: the angel (and who was
this but Jesus?) which redeemed me from all evil. "Pause, my soul.
Anticipate such a day. Figure to thyself thy friends around thee, and
thou thyself strengthened, just to sit up in the bed, to take an
everlasting farewell. What hast thou to relate? What hast thou treasured
up of God's dealings with thee, to sweeten death in the recital, to
bless God in the just acknowledgment, and to leave behind thee a
testimony to others of the truth, as it is in Jesus? My soul, what canst
thou speak of? What canst thou tell of thy God, thy Jesus? Hast thou
known enough of him to commit thyself into his Almighty hands, with an
assurance of salvation? Pause! Didst thou not in the act of faith, long
since, venture thyself upon Jesus for the whole of thy everlasting
welfare? Didst thou not from a perfect conviction of thy need of Jesus,
and from as perfect a conviction of the power and grace of Jesus to save
thee - didst thou not make a full and complete surrender of thyself, and
with the most perfect approbation of this blessed plan of God's mercy in
Christ, to be saved wholly by him, and wholly in his own way, and wholly
to his own glory? And as such, art thou now afraid, or art thou now
shrinking back, when come within sight almost of Jesus's arms to receive
thee? Oh, no! blessed be God, this last act of committing thy soul is
not as great an act of faith as the first was; for since that time thou
hast had thousands of evidences, and thousands of tokens in love and
faithfulness, that thy God is true. Sit up then, my soul, and do as the
dying patriarch did; recount to all around thee thy confidence in the
Son of God, who "hath loved thee, and given himself for thee." Cry out,
as he did, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord." And as this will
be the last opportunity of speaking a word for God, testify of his
faithfulness, and encourage all that behold you to be seeking after an
interest in Jesus, from seeing how sweetly you close a life of faith
before you begin a life of glory, in blessing God, though with dying
lips, that the last notes which you utter here below, may be only the
momentary interruption to the same subject in the first of your
everlasting song - "To him that hath loved you, and washed you, from
your sins in his blood."</p>

Peter 1:5</h3>
<p>"Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation."—I
Peter i. 5.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> When I call to mind that in me, "that is, in my
flesh, dwelleth no good thing;" when I stand convinced, (as I do most
fully, blessed be God the Holy Ghost, for having exercised his gracious
office in my soul, to this gracious effect,) that though renewed in the
spirit of my mind, yet in that unrenewed part of myself, which is
hastening to the grave, every member is virtually all sin; when I know
that never did sin break out in acts of open wickedness, in any son or
daughter of Adam, but that the seeds of the same sin are in me and my
nature; I long not only to know, but always to keep in remembrance by
what means, and from what cause it is, that those seeds do not ripen in
my heart, as well as in others; that while corrupt nature is the same in
all, it is restrained in me, while so many of my fellow-creatures, and
fellow-sinners, fall a prey to temptation. Blessed Spirit! the merciful
scripture of the evening answers the important question. They who are
kept, "are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation." Here
is the solution of the whole subject. With what humbleness of soul,
then, ought every child of God to fall down before the throne of grace,
under the deepest sense of distinguishing love, in the consciousness
that it is divine restraint, and not creature merit, which maketh all
the difference. Help me, Lord, to go humble all my days, in this view,
and let it be my morning thought, as well as my mid-day and evening
meditation, that I am kept by thy power, through faith unto salvation.
Almighty Father, help me to be living upon thy faithfulness in the
covenant of grace, established and sealed as it is in the blood of thy
dear Son, that "thou wilt not" turn away from me to do me good; and that
thou wilt put thy fear in my heart, that! shall not depart from thee. -
Jer, xxxii. 40. Precious Lord Jesus! give me to rest also upon an union
</span><span class="c6">with</span><span class="c5"> thee, a
communication of grace </span><span class="c6">from</span><span
class="c5">thee, and a participation in thee, in all the blessings of
thy redemption. Surely! am the purchase of thy blood, and thou hast
said," thy sheep shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of
thine hand."- John x. 28. And Oh! thou blessed Spirit of all truth, be
thou to me an indwelling security from sin, to keep me from falling, and
to preserve me faultless in Jesus, until the day of his coming. Make my
body thy temple, and cause me, by thy sweet constraining love, to
"glorify God in my body, and in my spirit, which are his. "- 1 Cor. vi.

19—Morning—Job 23:3,4,6</h3>
<p>"Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his
seat! I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
arguments. Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
would put strength in me."—Job xxiii. 3, 4, 6.</p>
<p>My soul, are these thy breathings? Dost thou really long, and, like
David, even pant, to come before the throne of grace? Art thou at a loss
how to come, how to draw nigh? Wouldest thou fill thy mouth with
argumerits, and have thy cause so ordered as to be sure not to fail?
Look to Jesus! Seek from him the leadings of the Spirit; and while thine
eye is steadily fixed on thy great High Priest within the vail, still
wearing a vesture dipped in blood, see to it that thy one great plea is,
for a perfect and complete justification before God and thy Father, upon
the sole footing of righteousness. Yes, my soul, plead earnestly,
heartily, steadily; and, like Jacob, wrestling with God, upon the sole
footing of righteousness: Wouldest thou fear on this ground? Yes, thou
wouldest have cause enough to fear and tremble, if thy plea was with the
least reference to any righteousness of thine. But, my soul, remember it
is Jesus's righteousness, and his only, with which, like Job, thy mouth
must be filled with arguments. This is the strength thy God and Father
will put in thee: and it is a strength of Jehovah's founded in his
justice. As a poor guilty sinner, thou couldest have nothing to plead
but free grace and rich mercy. But when thou comest in Jesus, thy
Surety's righteousness, thou mayest appeal, and art expected so to do,
to God's holiness and his justice also. Oh, how sweet the assurance, how
unanswerable the plea, how secure the event! Jesus hath fulfilled the
law - Jesus hath paid the penalty of justice; and God hath promised to
pardon and bless his seed, his redeemed in him. Hence, the apostle Paul,
in the contemplation of death and judgment, while looking at his
everlasting security in Jesus, cries out, "Henceforth there is laid up
for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them that
love his appearing. "Behold then, my soul, thy vast privilege; and when,
like Job, thou art desiring to approach a throne of grace now, or
looking forward to a throne of judgment hereafter-never, never for a
moment forget that this is the way, and the only way, (for a blessed
sure way it is,) maintaining communion with God in Christ. Thy God, thy
Father, will not plead against a righteousness of his own appointing;
but he will put Jesus, his strength, in thee. Hallelujah!</p>

19—Evening—Psalm 106:15</h3>
<p>"And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their
soul-Ps, cvi. 15.</p>
<p>Here is a very solemn subject to exercise the mind of a child of God.
My soul, take it for thine own exercise this evening. In the part of the
church's history alluded to, it should seem that they were just arrived
on the borders of Canaan: they had been all along fed and sustained by
God's bounty; and the manna, as usual, came fresh and pure from heaven
every morning; but tired and dissatisfied with the table of God's
providing, they demanded flesh to eat, and the Lord gave them their
request, but sent leanness into their soul. Happy would it have been for
the church of God, if such rebellions had been confined to that period
of its history. But, alas! in all ages, God's children too often
manifest the like temper. My soul! bring the subject home; thy God, thy
Jesus, hath appointed thee the very path best suited for thee. Had a
synod of angels been convened to choose what would be most conducive to
thy present and everlasting welfare, never could they have arranged
either thy state or circumstances better than Jesus hath done. Surely,
his infinite wisdom and love are manifested in all the appointments by
the way, which he hath made for thee as well in providence as in grace.
And yet how often hast thou thought, that such an- attainment, or such a
possession, would have been for thy good! And how often hast thou felt
displeased when matters appeared to thee discouraging! and in the
fulness of thy thoughts, thou hast at times felt disposed to tell thine
heavenly Master that such an exercise might have been spared; or that
such a temporal portion might have been given thee! And hast thou not,
more than once, afterwards discovered that had Jesus granted what thy
wayward heart perversely coveted, evil, and not good, would have
followed? If thou wouldest gather improvement from the church's history,
in the striking instance before thee, see the sad consequences of having
any earthly desire gratified, which for the most part bringeth leanness
into the soul. Ask the question from any of the chosen few, whose
situations are among the great or affluent, whether their souls do not
go lean, from their bodies being better fed than others? Prosperity in
this world is too dangerous to God's dear children; which very fully
explains why Jesus, for the most part, keeps his people humble. When the
Lord made Israel to ride upon the high places of the earth, and caused
him to drink of the pure blood of the grape; the next account is,
"Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked," Deut. xxxii. 14, 15. Precious Lord
Jesus, do thou choose for me, in every thing, and for every state; for
then I am sure, I shall be well provided for, and well taken care of.
Never, dearest Lord, grant any request of mine, which, in the weakness
and perversity of my heart, I might be tempted to put up, lest a state,
so truly awful as that of Israel should follow; and while the flesh
sought ease and fulness, there should be a leanness of soul!</p>

<p>"Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty."—Isa. xxxiii. 17.</p>
<p>Who, my soul, but Jesus could be intended by this sweet promise? And
who is beautiful and lovely in thine eyes but him? There was no beauty
in him while thou wert in a state of unrenewed nature, that thou
shouldest desire him; neither can any man truly love him, until that a
soul is made light in the Lord. Is Jesus then lovely to thee? Hast thou
seen him? Dost thou now know him, love him, behold him, as altogether
fair, and the chiefest among ten thousand? Then, surely, this promise
hath been, and is continually fulfilled in thy experience. Hast thou so
seen him, as to be in love with him, and to have all thine affections
drawn forth towards him? Dost thou, my soul, so behold him as to admire
him, and love him above all; and so to love him, as never to be
satisfied without him? Moreover - hast thou seen this King in his
beauty, in his fulness, riches, and suitableness to thee as a Saviour?
Surely, blessed Jesus, there are not only glorious, precious
excellencies in thee, and thine own divine person, which command the
love and affection of every beholder, as thou art in thyself; but there
is a beauty indeed in thee, considered as thou art held forth by our God
and Father, in all thy suitableness to thy people. In thy beauty,
blessed Lord, there is to be seen a fulness of grace, and truth, and
righteousness, exactly corresponding to the wants of poor sinners-thy
blood, to cleanse, thy grace to comfort, thy fulness to supply; in thee
there is every thing we can want-life, light, joy, pardon, mercy, peace,
happiness here, glory hereafter. And do I not see thee, thou King, in
thy beauty indeed, when I behold thee as coming with all these for my
supply? So that, under the enjoyment of the whole, I feel constrained to
cry out, with one of old," I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. The
Lord is my strength and my song; and he is become my salvation. "Neither
is this all; for in beholding the King in his beauty, I behold him also
in his love. Yes, blessed Lord, thou art indeed most beautiful and
lovely; for thou hast so loved poor sinners, as to give thyself for
them; and the conscious sense that our love to thee did not first begin,
but thine to us was the first cause for exciting ours, and the shedding
forth that love in our hearts, by thy blessed Spirit, first prompted our
minds to look unto thee, makes thee lovely indeed. And now, Lord, every
day's view of thee increaseth that love, and brings home thy beauty more
and more. The more frequent thou condescendest to visit my poor soul,
the more beautiful dost thou appear. Every renewed manifestation, every
view, every glimpse of Jesus, must tend to make my God and King more
gracious and lovely to my soul, and add fresh fervour to my love. Come
then, thou blessed, holy, lovely one, and ravish my spiritual senses
with thy beauty, that I may daily get out of love with every thing of
created excellency, and my whole soul be filled only with the love of
Jesus; until, from seeing thee here below, through the medium of
ordinances and grace, I come to look upon thee, and live for ever in thy
presence, in the full beams of thy glory in thy throne above.</p>

<p>"And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that
were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob."—Gen. xxxv. 5.</p>
<p>It was the evening before the last, that my soul was led to the
contemplation of what is the everlasting security of a child of God,
amidst all the corruption, within and without, which he carries about
him in a body of sin and death. It will form a very pleasing subject, to
a similar effect, to trace also a believer's security from the world at
large, in the natural enmity there is in every unawakened heart to a
state of grace. And this precious scripture traces every child of God's
safety to the same source. The family of Jacob, the praying seed of
Jacob, are still journeying; for here we have no continuing city, but we
seek one to come. The people of God are but few in number; yea, very
few: the scripture saith, "And they are strangers in the land," Ps. cv.
12. The very profession of the cross will always make them strangers;
and as men whose manners and pursuits differ from the world, like Joshua
and his people, "they are men wondered at." How are they kept from being
run down, oppressed, subdued, and overcome? This text answers: "the
terror of God was upon the cities round about them." Pause, and consider
the blessed subject, my soul, and never lose sight of it. He that
toucheth thee, toucheth the apple of Jesus eye. The reins of all
government, both of men and kings, are in Christ's hand; nothing can
take place but by his appointment. Oh.! how blessed to live in the full
persuasion of this most unquestionable truth. If a thorough sense of an
interest in Jesus, and an union and oneness with Christ, were always
uppermost in the heart, this filial fear in Jesus would drive out all
creature fear, as the fire of the sun puts out the fire on the hearth.
The prophet beautifully expresses this in one of his precepts to the
church: "Say ye not, a confederacy, to all them to whom this people
shall say, a confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid; but
sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let
him be your dread, and he shall be for a sanctuary," Isa. viii. 12, 13,
14.</p>

John 1:3</h3>
<p>"Truly, our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
Christ."—I John i. 3.</p>
<p>Precious, blessed consideration! Art thou, my soul, at this time in
the full enjoyment of it? Pause over the inquiry. Sometimes, for the
want of this search of soul, and the neglect of it, deadness, or at
least leanness, creeps in. Say then, my soul, how art thou dealing with
thy God? and how is thy God dealing with thee? When were his latest
manifestations? When did he take thee to his banqueting-house; or when
didst thou sit under his shadow? Hast thou very lately heard his voice,
saying, "Fear not, I am thy salvation?" The discovery of these things
are among the sweetest exercises which flow from the indwelling Spirit.
Go on further in the inquiry - how art thou dealing with thy God? When
hadst thou fellowship and communion with the Father, and with his Son
Jesus Christ? What petitions hast thou now awaiting for answers from the
heavenly court? What grateful acknowledgments have lately gone up for
mercies received? How is thine acquaintance there advancing? How art
thou growing in grace, and in the knowledge of thy Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ? If these things are neglected by thee, will not a
strangeness between thy God and thee come on; such as is induced by
earthly friendships, when absence and time, where there is no
correspondence kept up, wears out remembrance? My soul, rouse up, and
consider the vast importance of keeping up constant intercourse with thy
God and Saviour. Precious Jesus! do thou keep the flame of love alive;
manifest to my soul the certainty and reality of my union with thee,
thou sweet Saviour, by causing this blessed communion to be constant,
unceasing, and full of divine communications. Let thy Spirit call forth
in me the exercise of the graces he hath planted; and do thou come forth
in refreshing manifestations of love; so that, while prayers go up,
blessings may come down; and while thou art graciously saying, "Seek ye
my face," my heart may say unto thee, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." Oh,
the blessedness of such a life to break the power of sin; to revive and
strengthen the spirits; to open and to enlarge to my view the
discoveries of thy Person, thy glory, thy riches, thy suitableness,
thine all-sufficiency. If, dearest Jesus, thou wilt mercifully keep this
fellowship, this partnership, alive in my soul, how will my poor soul be
living upon thee, and with thee; and how shall I be exchanging with thee
all my leanness, poverty, wretchedness, and weakness, for thy fulness,
riches, righteousness, and strength? Come, then, Lord Jesus, and "until
the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou
like a roe, or a young hart, upon the mountains of Bether."</p>

<p>"A nail in a sure place."—Isaiah xxii. 23.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! through grace, thou hast long been enabled
to hang all thy grand concerns for eternity upon the Lord Jesus; and
will it not be a very refreshing subject for thine evening meditation,
to see how eternally firm and secure all rest, with an unshaken
and-unchangeable confidence? Behold him as he is in himself, in his
person, work, and righteousness; "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever. "Next contemplate him as the source, origin,
fountain, and support of all the great things of salvation. There is not

dispensation in all the kingdoms of nature, grace, and glory, but comes
</span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> Christ and his own
righteous government. Go on, under a third branch of meditation, and
behold Jesus as a nail in a sure place, and that the persons, concerns,
and blessings of his people all hang on him; </span><span

spiritual strength, gifts, graces, authority, order, and appointment;
</span><span class="c6">on</span><span class="c5"> him they all depend,

whole glory of their services return, in an endless revenue of praise.
Lastly, and above all, to crown thine evening meditation, on this nail
in a sure place, behold the hand of God thy Father, both fixing him
there, and proclaiming it to the souls of his people; "I will fasten
him," saith Jehovah," as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a
glorious throne to his Father's house. "Hail! thou glorious almighty
Mediator! founded on such authority, and possessing in thyself such
eternal principles, evermore will I hang my soul, and body, and spirit,
with all I have, and all I am or hope to be, in time and to all

nor too full a confidence be placed in him. How can a soul perish that
hangs on God's Christ?</span></p>

22—Morning—Jeremiah 2:2</h3>
<p>"Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the
love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,
in a land that was not sown."—Jer. ii. 2.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this condescending token of God's love to
Israel; and see whether it doth not hold forth to thee a blessed portion
for thy encouragement. Israel had been most undeserving; but yet the
Lord would put Israel in remembrance, by assuring his people that he
remembered their love when God first formed Israel into a people. When
he led them into the wilderness, and married Israel, they sung the
praise of Jehovah in their love-songs, on the day of their espousals.
'Now,' saith the Lord, - 'I remember thee in these things; for these
were tokens of affection when thou wentest after me in following the
pillar of cloud through the desert; in trusting to a harvest, though as
yet the land was not sown.' And may I, blessed Lord, sweetly interpret
this precious portion with application to myself, as though my God so
spake to me of the day of my espousals? Doth my God and Saviour remember
me in the first awakenings of his grace, when, at the first mention of
his name, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadab? Well, then,
may my soul remember thee, Oh thou God of my salvation! The savour of
thy past love and past experiences gives now, at this moment, new
delight to my soul, and awakens new desires of communion with my God.
The very recollection of what I then was, and how thou calledst me, and
made my time a time of love; and how thou passedst by, and didst bid me
live, and didst cleanse me, and take me home, and betrothedst me to
thyself, and made me thine for ever; the very thoughts refresh my soul
now; and these former experiences drive away present distresses and
despondency. How is it, my soul, with thee now? Art thou less in frame -
less in love? Hast thou not the same earnest liking to Jesus now, as
then? Is the strength of thy love, and desires, and delights, abated?
Look at this blessed scripture. Hear what God saith to Israel, in a time
of Israel's coldness. See how God's love was not changed, though
Israel's was so abated. Art thou, my soul, conscious of the same? Art
thou lamenting it; desiring, waiting for some renewed token of thy
Jesus's love? Is his name, his person, his righteousness still precious?
Dost thou wait but for the whispers of his grace? See, here it is - I
remember, though thou hast forgotten the day of thine espousals. Oh the
wonderful condescersion of the Son of God! Behold, my soul, how, in this
very way, he is preparing thine heart for the renewings of his love, and
his sweet manifestations towards thee. Oh cry out with the church of
old, under similar circumstances, "Draw me; we will run after thee."
Unless thou drawest, Lord, the distance will remain; but the desire of
being drawn, shews the earnestness for union. Lord, I beseech thee, do
this; bring me near to thyself, to thine everlasting embraces; then
shall I run, nay, even flee to my beloved, and will hang upon thee as
the vessel hangeth on the nail, and dwell, and remain with thee for
ever.</p>

22—Evening—Luke 25:2</h3>
<p>"This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them." Luke xv. 2.</p>
<p>My soul! wouldest thou, by faith, review some more than ordinary
representation of the Lord Jesus, to melt the finer feelings of thy
heart, in the contemplation of his unequalled condescension and love?
Let this be it, which the evangelist hath here drawn of the Son of God.
Behold him, encircled with poor publicans and sinners, alluring them to
the arms of his mercy; and behold the self-righteous pharisees and
scribes withdrawing from the sacred spot, and with all that indignation
and scorn, which marked their character, murmuring at the grace of
Jesus, saying, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them!" Well
is it for thee, my soul, that the Son of God hath received sinners; else
how should I have been looked upon by him? And well is it that his table
hath been spread for sinners; or how should I have been fed by him? Yea,
Lord, is it not the very feature of thy rich dispensation of mercy, that
it is for sinners, as sinners, that thou didst come down from heaven, to
seek and save them? And who but sinners, should Jesus, the great Saviour
of sinners receive, and eat with? Will the Lord allow me, this evening,
to dwell upon the sweet subject, and run over some of the blessed
thoughts, which arise out of this view of my compassionate and
all-loving Lord? Why then, I would say to my soul, remember, when thy
Jesus first received thee as a sinner, thou wert hastening on to ruin;
and it was then, of all moments the most alarming, when thou didst merit
hell, that Jesus received thee, and promised thee heaven. And do not
forget how truly seasonable was the mercy; for thou wast then living
without hope, without God, and without Christ in the world, when Jesus
brought thee nigh by the blood of his cross. And never, surely, was
mercy more unexpected, less sought for, or less esteemed, than when
Jesus surprised thee with the manifestations of his grace, and made thee
willing in the day of his power. Precious Redeemer! the pharisee's
reproach shall be my joy; and what they spoke of my Lord in contempt,
shall henceforth be the chief note in my evening song to his praise: -
'This man, this God-man, receiveth sinners and eateth with them, for he
hath received me, the chief of sinners, and eaten with me.' Lord Jesus!
ever receive me, the poorest, the most unworthy of all the objects of
thy grace. Come in, Lord, to my poor house, to my heart, and bring me to
thine house and to thy table; and there let it be noticed, and known to
every beholder, while my soul is feasting itself in the rich enjoyment,
that "Jesus receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."</p>

23—Morning—Hebrews 9:12</h3>
<p>"By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having
obtained eternal redemption for us."—Heb, ix. 12.</p>
<p>Ponder, my soul, these solemn expressions concerning thy Jesus. Mark,
in them, their vast contents. Jesus, as a prophet, hath revealed his
salvation: as a priest, he alone hath procured it, and offered it up to
God and the Father; and as a King, he ever lives and reigns to see its
efficacy fully accomplished in all his redeemed, being made partakers of
it. Behold in this, his priestly office, both as an high priest and as
the sacrifice, what he hath wrought, and what he bath accomplished -
even eternal redemption. Mark, my soul, the several volumes of mercy
comprised in it. First - Of man's revolt from God. Secondly - The deadly
breach by reason thereof. Thirdly - The proclamation from heaven, of
God's determined purpose to take vengeance of sin. Fourthly - Man's
total inability to appease the divine wrath, either by doing or
suffering. Fifthly - Divine grace, in the love of the Father, permitting
a substitute, competent to do this great act of salvation for men; and
appointing and constituting no less a person than his dear Son to the
accomplishment of it. Sixthly - Jesus, the Son of God, voluntarily
giving himself an offering and a sacrifice for sin, and by that one
offering of himself, once offered for ever, perfecting them that are
sanctified. Seventhly - Having thus accomplished the purpose of
salvation upon earth, Jesus now, by his own blood, entered into the holy
place, to make the whole effectual by the exercise of his priestly
office in heaven. And, lastly, to add no more - God accepting and
confirming his perfect approbation of the whole, and now proclaiming
peace on earth, good-will towards men. Ponder over these grand, these
glorious, these momentous subjects, my soul, this day. Take them about
with thee wheresoever thou goest; fold them in thy bosom; write them on
the tablets of thine heart; let them arise with thee, and lay down with
thee. And, in all thine approaches to the mercy-seat behold Him, and let
him never be lost to the view of the eye of faith, by whom the whole is
wrought, and of whom this sweet scripture speaks; who, "by his own blood
entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
for us."</p>

23—Evening—John 2:11</h3>
<p>"And manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on
him."—John ii. 11.</p>
<p>It forms a very sweet thought to the believer, that, amidst the
general darkness and ignorance concerniug the person of Jesus, in the
days of his flesh, the glory of his Godhead was frequently manifested to
his disciples, so that they knew him, and believed on him. And it is
equally blessed, that now, amidst the darkness and ignorance of many who
call themselves christians, after Christ, (but who denying, or being
unconscious of his Godhead, prove that they know him not) the Lord hath
not left himself without a witness of who he is, to the minds of his
faithful followers; but hath manifested forth his glory; and all true
disciples believe on him. My soul! if thou wert called upon to give thy
testimony to Jesus, concerning all the grand points which prove the
Godhead of his person, and the eternal merits and efficacy of his blood
and righteousness; how wouldest thou shew the evidences, that he hath
manifested forth his glory to thee, and that thou believest on him? I
would answer, Jesus hath fully manifested himself to me, as "One with
the Father, over all, God blessed for ever; "and as such, having seen
the Son, I believe in him, "in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily." Hence, therefore, as it is said, "they that know thy
name, will put their trust in thee;" so "I know whom I have believed;"
and by his blessed Spirit, am persuaded, that "he is able to keep that
which I have committed unto him to that day." Now, had not the Lord
Jesus, by his Holy Spirit, taught me who he was, and what he was able to
perform; had he not manifested forth his glory, never should I have
known him, so as to believe on him. But the revelation he hath made of
himself, hath induced all those saving effects, which none but the
teachings of his Holy Spirit could impart. It hath wrought in me faith
and love, humbleness and self-loathing, a regard for his cause, a zeal
for his honour, a love to his people, an indifferency to the world; and
all those gracious fruits of faith which follow the knowledge of Jesus.
Blessed Lord! my soul rejoiceth anew, this evening, in the contemplation
of thy glory. And under a sense of the distinguishing mercy, I feel
constrained to cry out with the astonishment of the apostle, "Lord! how
is it, that thou hast manifested thyself to me, and not unto the
world!"</p>

<p>"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
one."—John xvii. 23.</p>
<p>Think, my soul, to what a transcendant honour, to what a state of
unspeakable happiness, the truly regenerated believer in Jesus is
begotten. Who shall declare it; what heart shall fully conceive it?
Mark, my soul, how graciously thy Redeemer hath pointed it out, in those
sweet words. Observe the foundation of the whole, in that glorious
mystery of union between the Father and the Son. This is at the bottom
of all our mercies, and becomes the source and spring of every other.
"Thou in me," saith Jesus; not only as One in the nature and essence of
the Godhead, in a sameness of nature, of design, of will, of
perfections, and in all the attributes which constitute the
distinguishing properties of Jehovah; but peculiarly as Mediator, the
head of the church and people, in communicating all the fulness of the
Godhead to dwell bodily in Jesus, as the Glory-man, the God-man, the
Anointed of God. Thus, being one with Christ, and dwelling in Christ, in
such a way and manner as the Godhead never did, and never can, dwell in
any other. And as Jesus is thus One with the Father in the essence of
the Godhead, and the Father in him, dwelling in him, and being in him,
in all the work of redemption, as Mediator - so is Jesus one in the
nature of the manhood, with all his mystical members. "I in them," saith
Christ," as thou art in me. "Jesus is the Head of his body, the church,
and he is their fulness; and they members of his body, of his flesh, and
of his bones. Hence result the blessed effects which his redeemed all
derive from him," that they may be made perfect in one. "Sweet and
precious thought! in Jesus they are made perfect. From him they derive
perfection. As one with him, they are counted, and beheld perfect before
God; and by him they will be found so to all eternity. And what
particularly endears this lovely view of the believer's perfection in
Christ Jesus, is this; that every individual member of Jesus's mystical
body, is all alike equally interested in this perfection in Jesus. For
as it is from the same Spirit dwelling in them all, that they are
quickened to this spiritual life in Christ Jesus, and are all of them
made living members, and united to Jesus, their one glorious head; so
there must be an equally near and dear union to Jesus, and to one
another. Delightful consideration! as the apostle-reasons upon another
consideration - "The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee;
nor the foot say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body. "In
Jesus they are all one; neither can any touch the least of his people,
no more than the apple of his eye, without touching him. Is it so, my
soul? And art thou one with Jesus, one with the glorious Head, one with
the precious members? Hast thou communion in all that concerns Christ;
communion and interest in his Person; communion in his righteousness;
communion in his lice, in his death, in his resurrection, in his church,
in his people, in his ordinances, in all that concerns Jesus? Oh then,
rest assured that thou shalt have an everlasting communion, and nothing
shall separate thee from Jesus - neither in time nor to all eternity. Go
down, my body, go down to the grave with this perfect confidence - "That
if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal
body, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."</p>

24—Evening—Joshua 5:13-14</h3>
<p>"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lift up his
eyes, and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him, with
his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him, and said unto
him, art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, nay, but as
Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his
face to the earth, and did worship."—Joshua v. 13, 14.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul, what a most blessed portion here is, for thee to
feast upon, in almost endless thought. Who could this be, that appeared
to Joshua, but the Lord Jesus Christ? Who ever called himself the
Captain of the Lord's host; but he whom the Holy Ghost hath called," the
Captain of our salvation? "Heb ii. 10. is he not the same who appeared
to Adam in the garden, to Abraham in his tent, to Jacob at Bethel, to
Moses at the bush? And though he diversified his form, upon these and
several other occasions; yet all were only intended to familiarize his
people to the knowledge of him. And wherefore, dearest Jesus, was it,
that thou didst thus graciously condescend to visit thy chosen, so long
before the time appointed for the open display of thyself, when
tabernacling in flesh, but to tell thy church, that thy whole heart was
towards them in love, and that the thoughts thou hadst towards them,
were thoughts of good and not of evil? And although, in this thy
appearance to thy servant Joshua, thou didst assume the human form; yet
as Captain of the Lord's host, he instantly knew thy glorious character
of Mediator, and fell to the earth in adoration. Hail then, thou
almighty Lord, thou Captain of the Lord's host, and of my salvation!
thou hast indeed, indeed entered the lists of the holy war, and in thine
own person, led captivity captive, and fully conquered Satan and sin,
and death, and hell, for thy people: and thou wilt assuredly conquer all
those tremendous foes of ours, in thy people, and bruise Satan under our
feet shortly. Indeed, indeed, dear Lord, thou hast already brought them
under; for by thy sovereign grace in the hearts of thy redeemed, thou
hast made thy people "willing in the day of thy power." By the sword of
thy Spirit, thou hast convinced my soul of sin, and by the arrows of thy
quiver, thou hast wounded my heart with deep contrition for sin. Lord, I
fall before thee, as thy servant Joshua did, and worship thee; and with
all the church of the redeemed, both in heaven and earth, cheerfully
confess," that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

25—Morning—Luke 1:72</h3>
<p>"The mercy promised."—Luke i.72.</p>
<p>"The mercy promised!" Why, God graciously promised many mercies, and
most faithfully and fully performed them. Yes! every thing out of hell
may well be called a mercy. Every child of Adam beareth about with him,
day by day, tokens of God's mercy. The air we breathe, the garments we
put on, the food we eat; all the comforts, conveniences, enjoyments of
life; these are all mercies. But none of these are what the sweet
portion of the morning points at. It is here a particular, a Special,
one specific mercy. And who can this mean, my soul, but Jesus, thy
Jesus? - He is, indeed, "the mercy promised," the first mercy, the first
promise; the first, best, and comprehensive gift of God in the bible. He
is indeed the mercy of mercies, the first born, the sum and substance of
every other. He is essential to make all other mercies really and truly
mercies; for without him, they ultimately prove injurious. He is
essential to put a sweetness, to give a relish, a value, an impertance,
to every other. Where Jesus is, there is mercy; where Jesus is not, what
can profit? My soul, hast thou Considered this? - Dost thou know it? Is
Jesus thine? Is this mercy promised, really, truly given to thee? Hast
thou taken him home to thine house, to thine heart? Pause, if it be so,
how dost thou value him, know him, use him, live to him, walk with him,
hope in him, rejoice in him, and make him thine all? Hast thou received
him as a free mercy, an undeserved mercy? Hast thou accepted him as so
seasonable a mercy, that, without him, thou wouldest have been undone
for ever? Is he now so truly satisfying to thee in all thy desires, for
time and for eternity, that thou canst bid adieu to every enjoyment, if
needful; and, looking up to Jesus, canst truly say, "Whom have I in
heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I desire besides
thee?" Oh my soul, if this be thy portion, then hast thou a Benjamin's
portion indeed! God thy Father hath given thee indeed the mercy
promised; and Jesus is, and will be, thy mercy, and the mercy of all
mercies, to all eternity. Amen.</p>

25—Evening—James 5:11</h3>
<p>"Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and bare seen the end of the
Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy." James v.
11.</p>
<p>There is something uncommonly soothing and consolatory in these
words, concerning the Lord's grace, "that the Lord is very pitiful, and
of tender mercy." Very pitiful! Sweet consideration to a child of God,
under affliction! For it speaks in the tenderest and most endearing
manner, upon all such occasions, that if afflictions abound, while the
Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy, there must be a needs be for
them. My soul,-keep this thought always uppermost in thy remembrance;
and carry it about with thee in thy bosom for constant use, to have
recourse to, as occasion may require. And take another sweet lesson with
thee, to help on thy mind to suitable exercises on this account. Hadst
thou as much wisdom, and as much love for thyself, and what concerns thy
most material interests, as Jesus hath, and is using for thee, the most
painful exercises thou art now called to, and which thou art apt to
shrink from, would be among the subjects of holy joy. And mark farther
What the apostle saith: "Ye have heard of the-patience of Job, and have
seen the end of the Lord;" that is, in the issue of Job's trials. Who
that reads the patriarch's history, can doubt but that the Lord all
along intended the whole for his servant's happiness, as well as his own
glory? In all thine exercises, my soul, look to the end of them. Some
blessed purpose, depend upon it, thy Jesus hath in view in all, and he
will accomplish it. In the mean time, never forget, that "the Lord is
very pitiful, and of tender mercy:" in all the afflictions of his people
he is afflicted. And what a memorable scripture is that: "His soul was
grieved for the misery of Israel;" Judges x. 16. Precious Jesus! all is
well. In the sorrows of thy children, thou bearest a part; and the
largest part is thine; the heaviest end of every cross thou carriest.
The cup of our affliction is not bitter like thy cup of trembling: for
through thy love in redemption, the gall and wormwood are taken out.
There is no bitter wrath in the chastiaements of a kind father under
sin; for thou hast borne the wrath when made sin and a curse for us,
that we might be made the righteousness of God in thee. Often, my soul!
let these sweet consoling thoughts refresh thee. Thy Lord, thy Jesus,
"is very pitiful and of tender mercy."</p>

<p>"Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honey-comb."—Song iv. II.</p>
<p>While Jesus is so precious to his people, that they seek him in every
thing that is lovely, and indeed can discover nothing to be lovely until
they have found Jesus in it, what an endearment is it to the soul of a
believer, when he discovers Jesus looking upon him, eyeing him, and even
commending Jesus's own graces, which he hath imparted to the soul,
brought out into exercises again by the influences of his own Holy
Spirit. My soul, canst thou really be led to believe that Jesus is
speaking to his church, to his fair one, his spouse, to every individual
soul of his redeemed and regenerated ones, in those sweet words of the
song? Doth Jesus, the Son of God, call thee his spouse; and doth he say,
thy lips drop as the honey-comb? Pause, my soul, and ponder over these
gracious words of thy God. By thy lips, no doubt, Jesus means thy words;
of which Solomon saith - "pleasant words are as an honey-comb, sweet to
the soul and health to the bones. "Prov. xvi. 24. Do thy lips drop in
prayer, in praise, in conversation, in christian fellowship, in
ordinances, and in all the ordinary intercourse of life? Is Jesus thy
one theme; his name, his love, his grace, his work, his salvation; what
he hath done, what he hath wrought; how he hath loved, how he hath
lived, how he hath died, how he now lives again to appear in the
presence of God for his people; and to give out of his fuluess, his
mercies, his treasures: in visits, in manifestations, and the ten
thousand numberless, nameless, ways by which he proves himself to be
Jesus? Do thy lips, my soul, drop in these topics when thou walkest by
the way, when thou liest down, when thou risest up, and when thou goest
in before the presence of God, in the public worship of the temple, or
the private closet, where no eye seeth thee but him that seeth in
secret? And doth thy Jesus really mark these things? Doth he condescend
to notice his poor creature, and to esteem these droppings as the
sweetness of the honey? Precious God, precious Jesus! what a love is
here. O for grace, for love, for life, for every suited gift of my God
and Saviour, that my lips, from the abundance of the heart, may drop
indeed as the honey-comb - sweetly, freely, not by constraint, except
the constraint of thy love; but constantly, unceasingly, for ever, as
the drops of the honey-comb which follow one another; that prayer may
follow praise, and praise succeed to prayer; and that there may be a
succession in magnifying and adoring the riches of grace; that the name
of Jesus may be always in my mouth; and from that one blessed source,
that Jesus lives in my heart, and rules, and reigns, and is formed there
the hope of glory.</p>

26—Evening—Exodus 3:13-14</h3>
<p>"And Moses said unto God, behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me, what is his name? what shall I say
unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM, THAT I AM. And he said, thus
shalt thou say unto the dfildren of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto
you."—Exod, iii. 13, 14.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou fully considered, so as to rest in the full
assurance of faith upon it, on what the whole foundation of covenant
promises and engagements rest? It is not the greatness of the promise,
no, nor the greatness of the deliverance wrought out for poor sinners,
by the blood and righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, on which faith
founds its claim; for, in fact, the more astonishing, and great, and
unexpected the mercy is, as in the case of redemption by the Lord Jesus
Christ, the more difficult would it be for a poor self-condemned sinner
to trust in it, with full assurance of faith; but the great foundation
for thee, and for every poor sinner to ground his hopes of redemption by
Jesus Christ upon, is the faithfulness of that God which cannot lie,
having promised, as appears, from the beautiful instance this precious
scripture records. The Lord was going to send Moses, as his minister, to
bring out his people Israel from Egyptian bondage; Moses desires the
Lord to give him the commission with his name; whence, by the way we may
learn, that they who stand up in the Lord's name, ought themselves to
know who the Lord is, and from a proper acquaintance with the Lord, to
recommend him to those among whom they proclaim him, as one they
themselves know and trust in. To the inquiry of Moses concerning the
name by which he should hold him forth to his people, the Lord
condescends to give this answer; I AM THAT I AM: intimating the
selfexistence, the eternity, and faithfulness of JEHOVAH. As if God had
said, I AM, and therefore by virtue of this underived being, which I
possess in myself, I give being to all my promises. My soul! often call
to remembrance this grand and glorious truth. Thou hast not only the
perfect and covenant redemption of thy Christ's blood and righteousness
to confide in; but thou hast this other pillar and ground of the truth
to confirm thy faith; I AM hath engaged for it also. So that both the
blessedness of the promise, and the faithfulness of the Almighty
Promiser, are with thee. Plead both before the throne, for Jehovah will
ever be mindful of, glory in, and prove faithful to, all his covenant
promises in Christ, to a thousand generations. Hallelujah! Amen.</p>

27—Morning—Leviticus 15:9</h3>
<p>"The trumpet of the jubilee." Levit, xxv. 9.</p>
<p>My soul, pause over the subject of the jubilee trumpet; for surely
much of gospel was proclaimed by it. It should seem that there were four
distinct and special sounds of the trumpet in the camp of Israel. The
trumpet of memorials, so called, (Levit. xxiii. 24.) was blown on the
occasion of the new moon, calling the people to the joyful assembly,
Psalm lxxxi. 3. There was also the fast trumpet of which the prophet
speaks, Joel ii. 1. Besides these, the war trumpet gave a certain sound
to prepare to battle, 1 Cot. xiv. 8. And this of the jubilee, which
differed from all. And although the jubilee trumpet was never heard but
once in fifty years, yet so sweet and so distinguishing was the sound,
that no poor captive among the servants in the camp of Israel, was at a
moment's loss to understand its gracious meaning. Say, my soul, is not
the gospel sound, when first heard by the ear of faith, precisely the
same? When pardon was first proclaimed to thee by the blood of Christ,
and the day of his atonement so manifested to thy spiritual senses, that
the captivity of sin and Satan lost their power upon thee, was not this
indeed the jubilee trumpet, and the acceptable year of the Lord? Hast
thou heard this joyful sound? Hath the Son of God made thee free? Hath
Jesus caused thee to return to thy long-lost, longforfeited inheritance?
And wilt thou never forget the unspeakable mercy? Hail, thou Almighty
Deliverer, thou Redeemer of thy captives! I had sold my possession, sold
myself for nought; and thou hast redeemed it for me again without money.
I had sold it, indeed, but could not alienate it for ever, because the
right of redemption was with thee. Yes, blessed Jesus, thou art he whom
thy brethren shall praise. Thou art the next of kin, the nearest of all
relations, and the dearest of all brothers. And thou hast redeemed both
soul and body, both lands and inheritance by thy blood; and so redeemed
the whole, as never more to be lost again, or forfeited for ever. And
now, Lord, thy jubilee trumpet sounds; and the proclamation of the
everlasting gospel is heard in our land, to give liberty to the captive,
sight to the blind, to bring the prisoners out of the prison, and them
that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. Oh, cause me to know the
joyful sound, and daily to walk in the light of thy countenance. Cause
me, by the sweet influences of thy Spirit, to live in the constant
expectation of the year of the everlasting jubilee, when the trumpet of
the archangel shall finally sound, and all thy redeemed shall then
return to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; when
they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away. Hallelujah.</p>

27—Evening—Psalm 63:2</h3>
<p>"To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary."—Ps. lxiii. 2.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! knowest thou what it is, at times, to be
sensible of a barrenness of spiritual enjoyments? If at the house of
God, to be cold and lifeless there? If at home, or unable to attend the
place where God's honour dwelleth, yet there also to be without the
Bethel-visits of thy Lord? Behold one of old, in a wilderness state,
feeling the same. But do not fail to remark also, in the very breathings
of the soul </span><span class="c6">after</span><span class="c5">
Christ, how plainly his soul was under the sweet influences of Christ:
David did not so much long for the temple service, as for the presence
of the God of the temple. Remark also the peculiarity of expression: he
longed to see the Lord's power and glory, so as-he had seen </span><span
class="c6">him</span><span class="c5"> in times past. God in Christ is
Jehovah's power and glory; and the sanctuary without </span><span
class="c6">him</span><span class="c5">, would be no better than the
wilderness. What a beautiful devout frame of mind was this sacred writer
in, when thus going forth in earnest longing after the divine power and
glory, as manifested in the person of God in Christ! Now, my soul, canst
thou make use of the same language, even when thou art mourning in
retirement over the absence of the Lord Jesus? Is Jesus still the one
object of desire? And are the power and glory of Jehovah, as manifested
in the person of Jesus, the longing of thy heart to enjoy? Be comforted,
in still having before thee the great object of faith, and the actings
of faith, even when the waters of the sanctuary run low. God is still
honoured, still loved, still trusted in, and depended upon, by this
humble, though sorrowful frame; and ere long, he whom thou desirest to
see in his power and glory will manifest himself in both; and thou shalt
yet give him praise," who is the health of thy countenance and thy
God."</span></p>

28—Morning—Hebrews 9:16-17</h3>
<p>"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death
of the testator; for a testament is of force after men are dead,
otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth."—Heb.
ix. 16, 17.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Behold, my soul, how graciously the Holy Ghost hath
here represented the necessity of Jesus's death, in order that the
testament, or will, he left behind him, might have the intended effect;
and all the benefits and blessings he bequeathed in it to his people,
might be fully paid and made over to them for their present peace and
everlasting happiness. Now, my soul, mark down, for this day's special
meditation, the many precious things here contained. Observe how very
accommodating the Holy Ghost is to explain to thee divine things, by the
similitude of human transactions. As a man makes his will, so Jesus made
his. As what a man gives is altogether a free and voluntary act, so
Jesus was not constrained by what he gave in his blessed will; but the
whole was the result of his own free, gracious, and everlasting love.
And as a man must die before his will can be put in force, so Jesus
must, and did die, that his testament and will might have the full
effect also. But there is one sweet point more to be taken into this
account, in which, my soul, thy Jesus hath infinitely surpassed all men
in this article of their wills. When a man dies he appoints by will an
executor, to whom he must trust the management of all his effects after
his decease; and should his executor prove unfaithful, his best designs
for those he loved, when living, may all fail of the end when he is
dead. Now here lies the sweetness of Jesus's will: - he not only made
the will, but he himself will see it fully executed; for as he died
once, in order that by his death his will might be confirmed, so he ever
liveth to see the whole of his blessed gifts and legacies paid.
Precious, precious Jesus! how sure then is thy will, and the certainty
of every tittle of it being fulfilled. Now, my soul, there are two grand
things which concern thee to inquire concerning the will of the Lord
Jesus. The </span><span class="c6">first</span><span class="c5"> is,
whether thou hast any interest in it? And the </span><span
class="c6">second</span><span class="c5"> is, what the Lord Jesus hath
left behind him? Recollect, my soul, that in this instance, as in the
former, when men make their wills, it is to dispose of their effects to
their relations, their friends, their families. Jesus also hath his
relations, his friends, his family. Yes, thou dear Lord, thou
condescendest to call thy people thy spouse, thy brethren, thy children,
thy jewels, thy redeemed. My soul, dost thou claim relationship to
Jesus? Canst thou prove, or hast thou proved his will? Is Jesus thine
husband? Hath he betrothed thee to himself? Again - hast thou the marks
of a child in God's family? Art thou born again? Again - if you are his,
then hast thou his Spirit: "for he. that is joined to the Lord is one
Spirit." If you are a child of God, and a joint-heir with Christ, then
art thou under his divine leadings; "for as many as are led by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." If thou hast these marks of
relationship, thou mayest safely look for his gifts. Surely Jesus hath
remembered in his legacies his spouse, his children. And Oh, what an
inventory wilt thou find, my soul, under the second inquiry, when thou
hast fully proved the first. Oh, what legacies, what gifts, what an
inheritance, art thou entitled to by the will of Jesus! All temporal
blessings, all spiritual blessings, all eternal bIessings! Pardon,
mercy, peace, in the blood of his cross; the sweet enjoyment of all
providences in this life, and the sure possession of everlasting
happiness in that which is to come, Oh, how true was it, my God and
Saviour, when thou didst say, "I will cause them that love me to inherit
substance."</span></p>

28—Evening—Micah 7:18-19</h3>
<p>"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his
anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he
will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities: and thou
wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea."—Micah vii. 18,
19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! hast thou ever duly and thoroughly
pondered over the several interesting volumes of grace recorded in this
glorious scripture? If not, make them the subject of this evening's,
song. Let every chapter contained in them, pass and re-pass in review
before thee, and see whether, in the close of the whole, the
astonishment of the man of God is not thine also; crying out, "Who is a
God like our God? a God in Christ, gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
and of great kindness, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin!" And,
first, "He pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
remnant of his people." Yes; in Jesus, the Son of his love, he hath done
all this, and more than this, for he hath taken the objects of his
clemency into favour. Secondly, the cause of all these unspeakable
felicities is assigned; "because he delighteth in mercy." It is from
himself, and his own free sovereign grace, that these blessings flow.
Not what the highly-favoured objects merit, but what grace can do for
them. Not what claims they have to his bounty, but how his grace can
best be magnified in their salvation. Sweet and precious consideration
to the breast of every poor sinner! My soul! I hope that thou canst
truly participate in the delightful thought. Thirdly, he that delighteth
in mercy, will delight to </span><span class="c6">"turn
again"</span><span class="c5"> to his people. He will turn their hearts
to himself, and then his returns to them will sweetly follow, to their
apprehension, and to their joy. "Fourthly, he will not only pardon their
iniquity, but "he will subdue their iniquities: not only take away the
guilt of sin, but also destroy the dominion of sin; not only cast their
sins behind his back, but "cast them into the depths of the sea:" and so
effectually shall they be lost, that if the sin of Judah be sought for,
it shall not be found. The depths of the sea, that fountain which God
hath opened in the Redeemer's blood, shall more completely bury them,
than the congregated waters of the ocean cover any mountain or hill cast
into them. Say now, my soul! dost thou not look up to a God in Christ,
and cry out, with the prophet, in the same holy rapture and
astonishment, "Who is a God like unto thee?"</span></p>

29—Morning—Psalm 133:2</h3>
<p>"The precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard,
even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments."—Psalm
cxxxiii. 2.</p>
<p>My soul, behold, in the anointing here set forth of the Jewish high
priest, a type of His anointing who is a Priest for ever, and a Priest
upon his throne; and while looking at Aaron, say, as the Lord Jesus did
upon another occasion concerning Solomon, "A greater than Aaron is
here." It is sweet, very sweet, and very profitable, to behold the old
church shadowing forth the new, and the law ministering to the gospel.
Yes, blessed Jesus, I behold in Aaron, and in the precious ointment
poured forth upon his head, thus running down to the skirts of his
garments, the beautiful representation of that fulness of the Spirit,
which was poured out upon thee without measure; that from thee the
communication might glow down to the poorest, the humblest, the lowest
of thy members, even to the very skirts of thy clothing. "It pleased the
Father that in thee should all fulness dwell:" that of that fulness all
thy people might receive, and grace for grace. And by virtue of our
interest in thee, and union with thee, all thy people do richly partake
of communion in all thy benefits, blessings, mercies. The sun shines not
to itself, nor for itself, but to impart light and life to others: so
dost thou, the Sun of Righteousness, shine forth in all thy glory, not
for thyself, but to bless, and enliven, and give out of all thy grace
and fulness, every suited blessing, according to the measure of the gift
of Christ. My soul, bring home these precious truths to the conviction
of experience. Was Jesus indeed anointed for his people? Was grace
poured into his lips? Was he, like Aaron, so installed into the office
of the priesthood, and the Holy Spirit so unmeasurably communicated to
him, on purpose that all his little ones should partake of this
unspeakable gift of God? Did God the Father say to Jesus, "I will pour
my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing npon thine offspring?" Well
then, my soul, hast thou partaken of the Holy Spirit? Hast thou
communion with Jesus in all that concerns thy salvation? A child of God,
a joint, heir with. Christ, and a soul begotten of the Holy Spirit, hath
interest and communion in all that belongs to Jesus, as the Great Head
and Mediator of his church; interested in his Person, interested in his
work, interested in his righteousness, in his life, in his death, in his
resurrection, in his everlasting priestly office, and in his everlasting
glory. What sayeth my soul to these things? Go, my soul, go this
morning, go in the strength of this interest, and look at a throne of
grace, within the vail, whither thy forerunner is for thee entered;
behold thy glorious Aaron, wearing the priestly vestments still, and
having all grace, all fulness; waiting to be gracious, and to impart of
that fulness to thy necessities; and having received gifts for men, yea,
for thee, the most rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
Lord, proportion thy mercies to my wants; and as the day is, so let the
strength be.</p>

29—Evening—Matthew 5:25-26</h3>
<p>"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the
judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily,
I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast
paid the uttermost farthing."—Matt, v. 25, 26.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! hast thou agreed with thine adversary, and
made full payment of all the law charges? If so, it is blessed to review
the account, and look over the several particulars, wherein thou wert a
debtor, now struck out of God's book, and marked </span><span
class="c6">paid, paid,</span><span class="c5"> in red letters, with
Jesus's blood. To thee, as a sinner, born in sin, and an insolvent
debtor, both by nature and by practice, the law of God stood forth as
thine adversary. To agree with him as quickly as possible, whilst in the
way with him, and while life remains, which is every moment subject to
be ended, is the first and most momentous of all concerns. Hadst thou
not done this, and death had come, both law and justice must have
consigned thee over to the Judge of quick and dead; and having rejected
him as thy Saviour, and knowing him only as thy Judge, he must have
delivered thee to the angels, who are officers in his kingdom, to
execute his wrath; and into hell, as the eternal prison, thou must have
been cast: and as the debt then could never have been paid, so
deliverance could never have been obtained; but unsatisfied justice
would have continued to demand, without any possibility on thy part of
paying, to all eternity. Now see how thy account stands. It is a solemn
thing to deal with God. If thy debt of original and actual sin be not
paid by thy surety, it is not cancelled; but if Jesus, thy surety, hath
paid it for thee, thy God hath accepted it of him; yea, he himself
constituted and appointed him to pay it; and Jesus never gave over, nor
did he compound with God, until he had paid the uttermost farthing: then
art thou free. Oh! then, be often reviewing the blessed account, in
which all thy plea for grace and acceptance here, and glory hereafter,
most completely stands. Jesus hath paid the whole, and God the Father
graciously saith, "Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have
found a ransom."—Job xxxiii. 24.</span></p>

30—Morning—Romans 7:25</h3>
<p>"So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the
flesh the law of sin."—Rom, vii. 25.</p>
<p>Is this thy language, my soul? Hast thou learnt with Paul, with Job,
with Isaiah, and all the faithful gone before, to loathe thyself in
thine own sight? Dost thou groan, being burthened with a body of sin
which drags down the soul? Pause over this view of human nature. In the
first place - think, my soul, what humbling thoughts such a state of
corruption ought to induce. Though the mind be regenerated, though with
the mind the believer serves the law of God, delights in the law of God,
loves the law, and would make it the subject of devout meditation all
the day; yet such is the body of sin, the flesh with its affections, and
appetites, and desires, that it draws away the attention, imperiously,
puts in its claims, and rises up in rebellion continually. And are the
souls of God's children thus exercised, thus afflicted, in the struggles
between the different motions of grace and corrnption from day to day?
Yes, such is the state, such the uniform experience of God's people in
all ages. Paul thus complains, though he had been so highly sanctified.
Perhaps there never was a child of God brought into a closer and more
intimate communion with God. He had been caught up to the third heaven,
and heard unspeakable words. He had laboured more than all the apostles.
He had been converted by a miracle from heaven, and by the immediate
call of the Lord Jesus personally to him. But yet this highly favoured
servant of the Lord, this blessed apostle, who was continually flying on
the wings of zeal and love in the service of his Master, even he, with
his flesh, he-tells us, served the law of sin: nay, he felt and
discovered "a law of sin in his members, warring against the law of his
mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin which was in his
members;" and under a deep distress of soul he cried out - "Oh wretched
man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death!" Is it
so, then, my soul, with thee also! Dost thou discover the same in thy
experience? Dost thou feel the rebellions of sin rising up within thee?
Dost thou detect thine heart, wandering even in the moment of solemn
exercises; and, in short, thine own body, the worst and greatest enemy
thou hast to contend with? Oh then, learn from hence, what humbling
views oughtest thou to have of thyself, and to lay low in the dust in
consequence thereof before God. When thou hast duly contemplated this
state of fallen nature, let thy next improvement of this subject be to
endear the Lord Jesus to thee, my soul, more and more; to fly out of
thyself, to fly to Jesus, to take refuge in him and his great salvation;
from even thyself, with all that body of sin and death, under which thou
thus continually groanest; and to derive here from a daily and hourly
conviction, yet more strong and unanswerably conclusive, that nothing
but the blood of Jesus can cleanse, nothing but the righteousness of
Jesus can save and justify a sinner. Say as Paul did, when from the
bottom of his heart that soul-piercing question arose," Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus
Christ our Lord."</p>

30—Evening—Song of Solomon 7:2</h3>
<p>"I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would
instruct me." Song viii. 2.</p>
<p>My soul! hast thou ever noticed the peculiar beauties of this
scripture? if not, make it the subject of this evening's meditation; it
will amply recompence thine attention. The church is here in great
liveliness, and actings of faith upon the person of her Lord; indeed, so
much so, that we do not find any thing like this holy familiarity, used
by the church towards her Lord, in any other part of the bible. It is
the well-known office of Jesus, to lead his people, and to draw them to
himself. God the Father hath given him for this blessed purpose, as "a
Leader and Commander to his people. "Isaiah lv. 4. And Jesus himself
declared, that "if he was lifted up, he would draw all to himself." John
xii. 32. But here, it is the church leading Christ. Pause, my soul. Dost
thou know any thing of this, or like it, in thine own experience? Shall
I not hope thou dost? Look diligently; for if so, it will form a blessed
subject, not only for thy present mediration, but for every evening and
morning of thy life. And it will have a blessed effect also, in proving
the reality of thy faith, and of endearing to thyself the Redeemer's
love. Say, then, is not Jesus led by his people, when he is constrained
at any time, as the disciples constrained him at Emmaus, to remain with
them, until he maketh himself known to them in breaking of bread? Hast
thou not thyself been compelled, at times, to say, as they did, that
"thine heart hath burned within thee," when Jesus hath made himself
known, in the word of his grace; or when he hath manifested himself in
the tokens of his love, in softening thine heart when hardened, in
warming it when frozen, comforting it when cast down; and thou hast held
him in the galleries of his grace, by faith and prayer, and the
exercises of the graces of his Holy Spirit, which his own hand first
gave thee, and which his own power, in all the after-enjoyments of them,
called forth into actings upon his person, work, and righteousness? Luke
xxiv. 28-32. What wilt thou call these things, but leading Christ, and
bringing Christ into thy mother's house, the church, where Jesus
manifests himself to his beloved, otherwise than he doth to the world?
Was it not thus that Jacob led the Lord, and constrained him not to
depart from him, until he had blessed him? Gen. xxxii. 26. Was it not of
the same kind, in the instance of Lot, when, by faith and prayer, the
patriarch so led the Lord concerning Zoar, that the Lord said, "I cannot
do any thing till thou be come thither?" Gen. xix. 22. Precious,
precious Jesus! is it thus thy people have power with thee, and prevail
with thee to stay with them; and thou sufferest thyself to be led by
them, in all those instances where their furtherance in grace, and the
promotion of thy glory will be accomplished by it? Oh! then, thou dear
Lord! I beseech thee, give me such a double portion of thy blessed
Spirit, that, taking hold of thy strength, I may lead my Lord, by faith
and prayer, and all the goings forth of grace upon thy person and
righteousness, into such rich enjoyments as the church here had in view,
until" I cause thee to drink," also as she did, "of spiced wine of the
juice of my pomegranate!"</p>

31—Morning—Philippians 1:23</h3>
<p>"Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ."—Phil. i. 23.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, thou hast not, I hope, dismissed the
solemn thoughts opened to thy view by the scripture af yesterday.
Surely, since that last morning, thou hast had but too many renewed
occasions to feel the truth of it. Sin is not only present </span><span
class="c6">with</span><span class="c5"> thee at all times, but in thee,
and as inseparable from thy unrenewed part, as the shadow from the
substance. Thou knowest this, thou feelest it, thou groanest under it;
and the consciousness of it is, in itself, enough to make thee go humbly
all thy days. All other afflictions are nothing to this affliction:
this, like the ocean compared to rivers, surpasseth and swalloweth up
all. It is indeed a soul-supporting thought, (and, blessed be God, thou
feelest the sweetness of it,) that under all, and in all, Jesus is thy
hope. And while sin is always present with thee, Jesus, thy Advocate and
Propitiation, is present for thee with the Father. But though in Him,
and his righteousness accepted and secure, yet the consideration how
much thy daily short-comings and transgressions dishonour God, and
deprive thee of comfort here, is matter sufficient to make thine eyes
run down with water, and thine heart continually to mourn before
the-mercy-seat. And will these things always be the same, whilst thou
carriest about with thee this body of sin? Shall this perishing part of
thine be always so unfavourable to the sweet and gracious desires of the
soul? Shall I never, never truly and uninterruptedly enjoy Jesus until
the body is dissolved, and the dust returns to the earth out of which
that part of my nature was taken? Pause, my soul, and say - Hast thou
not then a desire to depart, and to be with Christ! Is not the grave, in
this view, not only made bearable, but even desirable-nay, even
pleasant? What, shall I never be wholly free from sin, until that I am
wholy freed from the body! Shall I never be secure of sweet enjoyment
with Jesus in ordinances, in retirement, in prayer, in praise, until
that I drop this body of sin? And wouldest thou not, my soul, gladly
part with such a partner, near and dear as it is, if this partner, in
its present state, so dreadfully robs thee of thy most precious
enjoyments? It is true, death in itself is not desirable: but if only by
dying thou canst enjoy Jesus; and if only by dying this body will lose
its corruptions; if the grave hath a commission from thy Jesus to
destroy that part only of thy body which is corrupt, and at the same
time to act as a preserver of that part which Jesus at the last day will
raise up to glory; if Jesus hath assured thee that, though worms destroy
thy corrupt part, yet thine eyes, even thy bodily eyes, when raised up
by Jesus a glorifled body, shall see God; and if thy body, thus raised
up and re-animated, shall then be not only wholly freed from all
corruption, but equally disposed as the soul to praise thy God and
Saviour for ever and for ever, and both soul and body unite as dear
friends in this blessed service. Oh then, from henceforth never, my
soul, look at death any more but as thy kind friend. It is to die to
sin; but it is to live to Jesus. It is to be dead to all things but
Jesus, that Jesus may be all things in life for ever. Oh then, for this
desire to depart and to be with Christ!</span></p>

31—Evening—Haggai 2:7</h3>
<p>"And the desire of all nations shall come."—Haggai ii. 7.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> And who could this be, but Jesus? Who, but he
alone, could be the object of desire; or able to gratify the desire of
all nations? Sit down, my soul, this evening, and consider the subject
to the full; and if the result be, as it surely must be, under divine
teaching, that none but Jesus can answer to this character, and he most
fully and completely comes up to it in every possible point of view;
thou wilt find another sweet testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus,
that he who alone is thy desire, hath ever been, and still is, to all
that need and seek salvation, the desire of all nations. And, first,
consider how universal the want of Jesus must be. "Ail the world is
become guilty (the scripture saith) before God. "Romans iii. 19. Hence,
in every nation, kindred, tongue, or clime, every poor awakened and
convinced sinner stands in need of a Saviour; and, however diversified
by language, customs, or manners, sin is felt exceeding sinful, and the
desire of deliverance from its guilt and its consequences, however
variously expressed, is the burden and cry of every prayer. Now suppose,
that to souls of this description, Jesus and his glorious salvation was
revealed, would not the desire of every heart be towards him? Surely
every eye would be directed to Jesus, and every tongue call aloud upon
his name. Hence it is that Jesus, and he alone, is the desire of all
nations. And as all poor sinners, whether conscious of it or not, stand
in need of salvation; so, </span><span class="c6">secondly,</span><span
class="c5"> it must be observed, that it is Jesus, and he alone, who can
give salvation: for, as the apostle speaks, "there is salvation in no
other, neither is there any other name under heaven, given among men,
whereby we must be saved." Acts iv. 12. And how extensive and
all-sufficient is Jesus, to answer the desire of all nations! As one sun
in the heavens becomes a fulness of light, and warmth, and healing to a
whole earth; one ocean to supply all the rivers and lakes, and the
inhabitants of the world; so one Lord Jesus Christ is both the Sun of
righteousness, and the everlasting river of life, which maketh glad the
city of God. Every want, and every desire that can be necessary for time
and eternity, all temporal, spiritual, and eternal blessings, are in
Jesus. He that is the desire of all nations, is in himself sufficient to
satisfy the desires of every living soul - Pause one moment, my soul,
over this view of thy Jesus, and say, is He, that is, the desire of all
nations, thy one, thine only one, desire, to which every other is
subordinate, and in which every other is swallowed up and lost? See what
answer thou canst give to the heart-searching question? And when,
through grace, thou hast derived renewed conviction from this view of
the subject, that none but Jesus can fully answer the desires of an
awakened soul, close the month, as thou hopest to close llfe, with the
blessed hope that he who is thy one desire now, will be thine
everlasting portion to all eternity. Amen and Amen.</span></p>

1—Morning—Jeremiah 23:6</h3>
<p>"And this is his name whereby he shall be called-THE LORD OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS"—Jer. xxiii. 6.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Begin this month, my soul, with contemplating thy
Jesus in this glorious distinction of character; and beg of God the Holy
Ghost, who hath here declared that, under this character, Jesus shall be
known and called, that every day through the month, and through the
whole of life, thou mayest find grace and strength so to know and so to
call Jesus, as to be everlastingly satisfied that thou art made the
righteousness of God in him. And first, my soul, consider who and what
this Holy One is. He is the Lord Jehovah. In the glories of his
</span><span class="c6">essence,</span><span class="c5"> he is One with
the Father. In his </span><span class="c6">Personal</span><span
class="c5"> glories, he is the Lord thy Mediator. And in his
</span><span class="c6">relative</span><span class="c5"> glories, he is
thy righteousness. For, by virtue, of his taking thy nature, what he is
as Mediator and as the Surety of his people, he is for them. Pause over
this blessed view, and then say, what can be more blessed than thus to
behold Jesus as what he is in himself </span><span
class="c6">for</span><span class="c5"> his people. Look at him again, my
soul, and take another view of him in his loveliness; in what he is to
his people. This precious scripture saith, that he is the Lord
</span><span class="c6">our</span><span class="c5"> righteousness; that
is, by virtue of his Godhead he is our righteousness, in such a sure
way, and with such everlasting value and efficacy, as no creature could
be. The righteousness his redeemed possess in him, and have a right in
him, and are entitled to in him, is the righteousness of God; and
therefore impossible ever to be lost, and impossible ever to be fully
recompensed in glory. Sweet and blessed consideration! it seems too
great to be believed. And so it would indeed, if the authority of
Jehovah had not stamped it, and made the belief of it the first and
highest act of a poor sinner's obedience. And observe, my soul, yet
further, there is this blessed addition to the account "he shall be
called so." By whom? Nay by every one that knows him. The poor sinner
shall call him so, who is led to see and feel that he hath no
righteousness of his own; he shall call Jesus his Lord, his
righteousness. He shall call him so to </span><span
class="c6">others;</span><span class="c5"> he shall call upon him for
</span><span class="c6">himself:</span><span class="c5"> he shall be
that true Israelite, that very one whom the prophet describes - "Surely,
shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength." The
redeemed upon earth, the redeemed in heaven, the church of the
first-born, shall call him so. The whole army of patriarchs and
prophets, and apostles, all shall know Jesus as the Lord our
righteousness. Nay, God himself, our Father, shall call his dear Son by
this glorious name; for it is He who hath constituted and appointed him
as the Lord our righter ousness. And that Jesus is our righteousness is
from this very cause, "that he is made of God to us wisdom and
righteousness, sanctification and redemption, that he that glorieth may
glory in the Lord." Now, my soul, what sayest thou to this sweet view of
Jesus in this most precious scripture? Is not this name of Jesus most
grateful to thee, as ointment of the richest fragrancy poured forth? Can
any name be as sweet and delightful to one convinced, as thou art, that
all thy righteousness is as dung and dross, as that of Jesus the Lord
our righteousness? Witness for me, ye angels of light, that I renounce
every other; and from hence, forth will make mention of his
righteousness, and his only. Yes, blessed Jesus, my mouth shall daily
speak of thy righteousness and salvation; for I know no end thereof.

1—Evening—Jeremiah 33:16</h3>
<p>"And this is the name, wherewith she shall be called, the Lord our
righteousness."—Jer, xxxiii. 16.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! the subject of thy morning meditation
would not be complete, if thy personal interest in it were not taken
into the account; and therefore let thy mind be led forth, this evening,
in sweet contemplation upon what the Holy Ghost hath said, in this
scripture, by his same servant, the prophet, concerning the church of
Jesus. If Jesus be called "the Lord our righteousness," and be, as he is
well known to be, the husband of his people, surely his wife shall be
called by her husband's name. She shall be called so because it is her
husband's name; "the Lord our righteousness." And as he became sin for
her, when he knew no sin; so she, when she knew no righteousness, shall,
by virtue of her union and relationship with him, be righteousness, even
"the righteousness of God in him," 2 Cor. v. 21. Now, my soul, seeing
that these things are certain, sure, and unquestionable, do thou follow
up the transporting meditation in every way, and by every way, and by
every consideration, in which the blessedness of it is confirmed and
assured. Married to Jesus, thou hast an interest in all he hath as
Mediator, as the glorious Head of his body, the church," the fulness of
him that filleth all in all. "And indeed, it is such an union and
oneness, as nothing in nature can fully represent: "For he that is
joined to the Lord is one spirit," 1 Cor. vi. 17. It infinitely
transcends the marriage union, which is only in natural things, and at
death is dissolved; for this union is spiritual, and continues for ever.
Hence Jesus saith," I will betroth thee to me for ever," Hosea ii. 19.
Never lose sight of this high union, and the infinitely precious
blessings to which, by virtue of it, thou art entitled: and while thou
art called by his name, see that thou hast a conformity to his image. An
union of grace should be manifested by an union of heart. What thy Jesus
loves, thou shouldest love; and what he hates, do thou hate. Let his
people be thy people; and his God and Father thine also. And from being
one with him in heart, in mind, in sympathy, and affection; receiving
life </span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> him, living
</span><span class="c6">on</span><span class="c5"> him, and being
</span><span class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> him; then will he be
every thing to thee, of grace in this life, and of glory in that which
is to come. Precious Lord, and husband of thy people, be thou made of
God to me, and all thy redeemed," wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
and redemption that according as it is written, he that glorieth, may
glory in the Lord!"</span></p>

2—Morning—Leviticus 26:21-22</h3>
<p>"And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat,
and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
ali their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head
of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities, into
a land not inhabited."—Lev, xvi. 21, 22.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Pause, my soul, and behold the tender mercy of thy
God, in thus causing to be represented to the church of old, by so
striking a service, that grand and most momentous doctrine of the
gospel, which, in after-ages of the church was fully set forth and
completed, when Jehovah laid upon our Lord Jesus Christ the iniquities
of his people. And do, my soul, attend to those several most interesting
points here graciously revealed. As first - this was at the express
command of God. Yes, who but God could transfer or permit a change of
persoas in the transferring of sin? This is one of the most blessed
parts of the gospel, that when Jesus bore our sins in his own body on
the tree, it was by the express will and appointment of Jehovah. The
Lord Jesus took not those sins on himself; but the Lord laid on him the
iniquity of us all. Mark this down in strong characters. Then next
consider - that as Jesus had a transfer of all the sins of his people,
consequently they were no longer upon the people, from whom they were
transferred. Here faith finds full scope for exercise, in giving God the
credit due to God. The sending away the goat was intended to represent
the full remission of sins; and by the goat bearing them away into a
land not inhabited, intimated that those sins should never be seen nor
known any more; according to that precious scripture of the Holy Ghost
by the prophet - "The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there
shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found," Jer.
1. 20. And there is one sweet thought more, not to be overlooked in this
blessed scripture, concerning those sins. Observe, my soul, the
particularity of the expression. The confession of Aaron, the great high
priest, was not only of all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
but all their transgressions in all their sins. Pause, my soul, over
this view, and recollect that there are many, and sometimes very heinous
and aggravated circumstances of transgression in thy sins. Now what a
sweet thought of relief to thy mind is it, under particular and galling
circumstances, of sin, to behold thy Jesus bearing thy sins, and all the
transgression of all thy sins. The Lord caused </span><span
class="c6">to meet in him</span><span class="c5">, as the passage might
have been rendered, the iniquities of us all. Isa. liii. 6. Jesus was
made as the common, receiver, the drain, the sink, into which all the
sins, and every minute and particular sin, was emptied. "He shall drink
of the brook in the way," said the Holy Ghost. Ps. cx. 7. Was not this
the black and filthy brook of Cedron, iato which all the filth from the
sacrifices of the temple was emptied? Here it was Jesus passed, when, in
the night of his entering on his passion, he went into the garden. Look
to this, my soul, and see whether it doth not strikingly, though
solemnly, at the same time, set forth Jesus bearing all and every
particular transgression in all thy sin. One thought more. The goat thus
laden with all the sins of the people, was to be sent away by the hand
of some fit man into the wilderness. As none but Jesus could be
competent to bear sins, so none but Jesus could be fit to bear them away
into a land of everlasting forgetfulness. It doth not lessen the beauty
of this blessed scripture in the representation here made, in Jesus
being set forth under two characters; for he is so in many. None but
Jesus can indeed accomplish all: he is the High Priest, the Altar, and
the Sacrifice, through all the law; and he is the fit man here
represented, as well as the burden-bearer of sin. Hail! thou great High
Priest! Blessed for ever be thou who hast borne away all the sins of thy
people into a land not inhabited. Thou hast crossed out, in God's book
of account, each and every individual sin, and the transgression of all
our sins, in the red letters of thy blood; and never shall they appear
again to the condemnation of thy people.</span></p>

2—Evening—Deuteronomy 3:25</h3>
<p>"I pray thee let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond
Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon." Deut. iii. 25.</p>
<p>What a very lovely and interesting view doth this sweet scripture
afford of Moses, the man of God! Look at him, my soul, as the Holy Ghost
hath here represented him, and pray for grace to gather some of those
blessed instructions which this part of his history particularly
affords. And what was it that made Moses so anxious to go over and see
the good land? It was but a type of heaven, even in its highest glory;
and surely the type or representation of any thing cannot be equal to
the thing itself; and Moses knew, that if he had not the type, he should
have the substance: if debarred Canaan, he should be in heaven. There
must have been some other cause, which made Moses long for the sight of
it. I venture to think (we may at least conjecture) and this scripture,
I confess, leads me to the idea: "Let me see (said Moses) that goodly
mountain, and Lebanon. "This was the one hallowed spot Moses longed to
see, and to feast his eyes upon. He who had conversed with Jesus at the
bush, wanted to behold, and with sacred meditation, by faith, converse
with him, on the very spot where, in after ages, he knew that Jesus
would be crucified. He who by faith walked with Jesus, while in Egypt,
so as "to esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches than all its
treasures;" would there, by faith, have realized the presence of his
Lord in sweet communion: and if, through faith, he kept the passover,
and the sprinkling of blood, in the ordinance of the paschal lamb, what
may we not suppose the man of God would have felt, as he traversed over
the sacred goodly mountain, and Lebanon? 'Here,' he would have said, as
he beheld, by faith, the day of Christ afar off, like the patriarch
Abraham, 'here is the memorable ground, the holy mountain, on which
Jesus, "my dweller in the bush," will one day make his soul an offering
for sin? Here will go up before God the Father, that one sacrifice to
which all under, the law shadowed and ministered, and by which the Lord
Jesus will for ever perfect them that are sanctified! Here the Son of
God will for ever do away sin by the sacrifice of himself.' Oh, Lebanon!
that goodly mountain! for ever sacred to the soul's meditation of all
the redeemed of the Lord Jesus! though, like Moses, I have not trodden
thine hallowed ground; yet, by faith, I have seen Jesus in his agonies
and passion there; and bless and praise God and the Lamb, for the
wonders of redemption. Lord, bring me to the everlasting enjoyment of
thy person, work, and righteousness, in glory, for this will be indeed
the good land that is beyond Jordan; the goodly mountain, and Lebanon:
that "when I awake after thy likeness, I may be satisfied with it."</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

3—Morning—Isaiah 53:3</h3>
<p>"A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." Isa. liii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, there is one feature in thy Redeemer's character, which, in
the unequalled abasement of his person, demands thy constant
contemplation. I fear it hath not been considered by thee as it ought.
And yet it is so sweetly accommodating and lovely, that the more thou
beholdest thy Jesus in this tender light, the more endeared he must
appear to thee. The prophet, under the Holy Ghost, hath here in a few
words sketched the outlines of it - "A man of sorrows, and acquainted
with grief?" It was most essential that Jesus should be all this,
because it belonged to the curse which he became for his people, when he
offered himself as their surety. You will remember, my soul, the curse
which God pronounced upon the earth, and man's passage through it, when
he broke the divine law. The ground was cursed; the product of it was to
be thorns and thistles; in sorrow, and in the sweat of the brow, was man
to eat bread; and, at length, death was to close the life. Now it
behoved him who undertook to remove the curse, to bear that curse before
the removal of it; and, as such, it behoved Jesus to be "a man of
sorrows and acquainted with grief. "Hence all these seized on the Lord
Jesus in the first moment he assumed our nature. And though he had no
sin in his nature; not being born in the ordinary way of our nature,
yet, as a Surety, he was at once exposed to all the frailties in the
sinless sorrows, and travails, and labours of it. This sentence would
not have been fulfilled, had not Jesus eat bread in the sweat of his
brow. So interesting a part, therefore, was it in Christ's life, that he
should labour in a common occupation, that this part of the curse might
not go by, without being accomplished. And how eminently, my soul, was
this part indeed fulfilled, when, in the garden, the sweat of his brow
was drops of blood! How full of thorns and thistles was the earth to
Jesus, may be in some measure considered, when we behold him in the
unequalled sorrows of the opposition he met with from the world, the
unkindness of friends, the malice of enemies. The thorny crown put upon
his sacred head was little considered by those that put it; but yet it
was, in reality, crowning him Lord of sorrow and grief, beyond all men
that ever were exercised with affliction. So great, indeed, was the
continued load he bore of grief, and so much did it tend to waste and
wear the spirits, that according to that expression of the Jews to him -
"thou art not yet fifty years old," evidently proved, that he had the
visage of one of fifty, when only thirty. And it is remarkable, though
we are told that Jesus rejoiced in spirit, yet we never read that he was
once seen to laugh during his whole life. Precious Jesus, enable me ever
to be looking unto thee, thou meek and lowly Lamb of God! And may I
never lose sight of this sweet part of thy character also; that whilst
thou didst bear our sins, so didst thou carry our sorrows; and in
fulfilling the law, didst take away the curse also, when in sorrow thou
didst eat bread all the days of thy life.</p>

3—Evening—John 6:27</h3>
<p>"For him hath God the Father sealed." John vi. 27.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, hast thou ever remarked the peculiar glory
of those scriptures, which comprise within a small compass all the
persons of the Godhead, as concurring and co-operating in the grand
business of salvation? No doubt, all scripture is blessed, being given
by inspiration of God; but there is a peculiar blessedness in these
sweet portions, which at one view, represent the Holy Three in One,
unitedly engaged in the sinner's redemption. My soul, ponder over this
divine passage, in thy Saviour's discourse, as thus: who is the
</span><span class="c6">Him</span><span class="c5"> here spoken of, but
the Lord Jesus? And whom but God the Father could seal Christ? And with
whom was Christ sealed and anointed, but by God the Holy Ghost? Would
any one have thought, at first view, that in seven words, such a blessed
testimony should be given to the glorious foundation-truth of the whole
bible? "For him hath God the Father sealed. "Precious Jesus! enable me
to behold thy divine authority as the warrant of faith in this gracious
act of thy Father. And while! view thee as infinitely suited for my poor
soul, in every state and under every circumstance, let my soul find
confidence in the conviction that the validity of all thy gracious acts
of salvation is founded in the seal of the Spirit. Yes, thou dear Lord,
it was indeed the Spirit of Jehovah that was upon thee, when thou wast
anointed to "preach the gospel to the poor, to heal the broken in heart,
to give deliverance to the captive, and the restoring of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, and to proclaim the
acceptable year of the Lord. "And art thou, dearest Lord, thus held
forth, and thus recommended by the grand seal of heaven, to every poor
sinner who feels a conscious want of salvation? Oh then help, Lord, by
thy blessed Spirit, all and every one of this description, so to receive
a sealed Saviour, as to rest in nothing short of being sealed by him;
and while every act of love, and every tendency of grace proclaims thee,
blessed Jesus, as "Him whom God the Father hath sealed," so let every
act of faith, and every tendency of the soul, in the goings forth after
thee, be expressive of the same earnest longings as the church, of being
sealed and owned by thee, when she cried out," Set me as a seal upon thy
heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy
is cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a
most vehement flame. "</span></p>

4—Morning—Matthew 25:36</h3>
<p>"A place called Gethsemane. "—Matt. xxvi. 36.</p>
<p>My soul, let thy morning meditation be directed to the garden of
Gethsemane, that memorable spot, sacred to the believer, because so much
beloved and resorted to by Jesus. Here Jesus oft came with his
disciples. And here, my soul, do thou often take the wing of faith, and
flee in devout contemplation. Was this place dear to thee, thou precious
Redeemer? And was it not because here thou didst enjoy the sweetest
refreshing in communion with the Father? Was it not because here thou
knewest would begin the conflict and the agony, in which the great
business for which thou camest on earth would be accomplished. Didst
thou abide here, Lord, a whole night, after a day's constant preaching
to the people, the week only before thy crucifixion. (See Luke xxi. 37.)
And when the night was past, didst thou again repair to the temple to
the same employ? Was Gethsemane dear to Jesus! Was here his favourite
haunt? And shall not my soul delight to be oft here in solemn
meditation? Will not my Lord lead me there, and go with me there, and
sweetly speak to me there; that while, in imagination, I tread the
sacred ground, my soul may view the several spots, and say—Here it was,
perhaps, my Redeemer was withdrawn a stone's cast from his disciples,
that the powers of darkness might more furiously assault his holy soul;
and here stood the angel sent from heaven to strengthen him; and here
the Lord Jesus was in his agony, when the sweat of his body forced
through all the pores great drops of blood, falling down to the ground!
Is this Gethsemane? And why Gethsemane? The Jews call it Ge-hennom, or
hell; for here it was that Josiah burnt the idol vessels. 2 Kings xxiii.
4 - 10. And it is the same as Tophet, the only word the Jews used for
hell after their return from the Babylonish captivity. The field of
Cedron was indeed a dark and gloomy place; and by its side ran the foul
and black brook which Jesus passed over when he went into Gethsemane.
Here David, of old, went mourning and lamenting, when Ahitophel, like
another Judas, betrayed him, and his life was sought after. 2 Sam. xv.
23. And here the Son of David passed also, when the man of whom David by
the spirit of prophecy spake, (Ps. xli. 9.) which eat bread with Jesus,
lifted up his heel against him. And was this Gethsemane the favoured
spot of Jesus, because here he had so sweetly enjoyed communion with his
Father, and because he here should encounter the powers of darkness?
Learn then, my soul, from thy Jesus where thou oughtest to seek grace in
a refreshing hour, to comfort a trying hour. Say, my soul, where should
be thy dying place, but where thy God hath most blessed thy living
place? There, Jesus, make my seasons (if needs be) of conflict, where
thou hast sanctified and made blessed by thy Bethel visits. And was a
garden the favoured spot of Jesus? Yes, it was in a garden the first
Adam lost himself and his posterity; there, then, Jesus will recover the
forfeited inheritance. Did the devil begin in heaven to ruin man? Why,
then, in Gethsemane Jesus will begin to conquer hell for man's recovery.
Did Satan, from the garden, bind and carry captive the first Adam? Then
from a garden also shall he cause to be bound, and carried away to the
cross, the second Adam," that he, by death, might destroy him that had
the power of death—that is, the devil; and deliver them who, through
fear of death, are all their life-time subject to bondage. "Solemn
Gethsemane! awful, but hallowed spot! Here would I often come here
contemplate Jesus, my blessed Surety, groaning, yet! conquering; pressed
under all the hellish malice of the devil, yet triumphing over all;
deserted by his disciples, sweatiug a bloody sweet, sustaining the wrath
of offended justice, drinking the cup of trembling! Is this Gethsemane?
Oh, thou Lamb of God, thou paschal Lamb! here oft bring me; here shew me
thy loves: and as thy joys were here turned into sorrows, give me to see
how the curses which I deserved, but which thou didst endure, were
converted into blessings; and that by thy stripes I am healed. Hail
sacred Gethsemane!</p>

savour of thy morning meditation? Surely Gethsemane is not forgotten by
thee! Pause over the subject; and from the whole mass of the soul
sufferings of thy Lord, behold what crowned the whole: "Thy rebuke,
(saith Jesus to the Father,) thy rebuke hath broken my heart. "To search
into the depths of this mediation is impossible; for who shall describe
it? What human, or even angelic intellect can fathom the profound
subject? That this was the greatest and heaviest weight in the whole
curse, we may venture to suppose: because we read of nothing which bore
so hard upon the holy Jesus, amidst all his agonies, as the Father's
rebuke. It was this which "broke his heart. "My soul! repeat the solemn
scripture, as if Jesus was in the moment uttering the words: "Thy rebuke
hath broken my heart. "Precious Lord! could not this have been spared
thee?—Pause, my soul!—Lamb of God! must the rebuke of thy Father be also
in the curse?—Pause again, my soul! When Jesus made his soul an offering
for sin, would not the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation,
shew the least portion of favour to his dear, his beloved, his only
begotten Son?—Pause, my soul, yet once again, and ponder over the solemn
subject! "It pleased the Father to bruise him, to put him to
grief."—But, my soul! though neither thou, nor perhaps angels of light,
can explain the extremity of the Redeemer's sufferings, in the rebuke of
the Father for sin, which broke his heart; yet in the contemplation of
the </span><span class="c6">lesser</span><span class="c5"> sorrows of
the curse which Jesus endured, thou wilt be led to form some faint idea,
however small, in comparison of the real state of it, to induce a train
of the most solemn meditations. When the Son of God assumed our nature,
though in a holy portion of that nature, untainted by the fall, being
not derived by ordinary generation, yet coming as the sinner's surety,
he took upon him the curse for sin; he was first made </span><span
class="c6">sin</span><span class="c5">, (2 Cor. v. 21.) and then a
</span><span class="c6">curse</span><span class="c5"> for us (Gal. iii.
13); as such, he was invested with every thing belonging to the
frailties of our nature, which might expose that nature to sorrow, and
suffering, and death. The sentence of the fall was, "Dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return;"Gen. iii. 19: so that the curse, then
seizing the human nature of Christ, at once tended to waste all the
animal spirits, and to induce a state of mind peculiarly low and
dejected. Agreeably to this, we find, that the holy Jesus, though it is
once said of him, that in that hour "he rejoiced in spirit," when the
devils were subject to his name (Luke x. 18 - 21.) yet is it never said
of him, that he was once seen to laugh. As the sinner's surety, he
sustained every thing of sorrow which belonged to God's curse against
sin; and became eminently marked with affliction; and in a way which
none but himself ever waded through; yea, to make the horrors of death
more tremendous and bitter, the very sun became darkened at mid-day; not
so much, I humbly conceive, as some have thought, to intimate, by the
miracle, God's displeasure at the act of the Jews in the crucifixion of
Christ, as to manifest the Father's rebuke of sin, which Jesus then
stood as the sinner's surety to answer for, and which Christ, as if
summing up the whole of his misery, declared to be the finishing stroke,
which had "broken his heart. "My soul! look up, and thus behold the Lamb
of God! Oh! thou precious, precious Redeemer! the sons of thy Zion, but
for this blessed undertaking of thine," would have fainted for ever!"
They would have lain "at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a
net; they would have been full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of
thy God." But now, Lord, thou hast swallowed up death in victory: "the
Lord God hath wiped away tears from off all faces: and the rebuke of thy
people thou hast taken away from off all the earth: for the mouth of the
Lord hath spoken it."</span></p>

5—Morning—Luke 22:44</h3>
<p><span class="c6">"Being in an agony</span><span class="c5">."—Luke
xxii. 44.</span></p>
<p>My soul, art thou still in Gethsemane? Look at Jesus once more;
behold him in his agony; view him in his bloody sweat, in a night of
cold, and in the open air, when we are told the servants, in the high
priest's hall, were obliged to make a fire of coals to warm themselves.
In such a night was thy Jesus, from the extremity of anguish in his
soul, by reason of thy sins, made to sweat great drops of blood. Look at
the Lord in this situation; and as the prophet, by vision, beheld him
coming up with his dyed garments, as one that had trodden the wine fat;
so do thou, by faith, behold him in his bloody sweat; when, from
treading the winepress of the wrath of God, under the heavy load of the
world's guilt, his whole raiment was stained with blood. Sin first made
man to sweat: and Jesus, though he knew no sin, yet taking out the curse
of it for his people, is made to sweat blood. Oh thou meek and holy Lamb
of God! methinks, I would, day by day, attend the garden of Gethsemane
by faith, and contemplate thee in thine agony. But who shall unfold it
to my wondering eyes, or explain all its vast concern to my astonished
soul! The evangelists, by their different turns of expression to point
it out, plainly shew, that nothing within the compass of language can
unfold it. Matthew saith, the soul of Jesus was "exceeding sorrowful,
even unto death. "Matt. xxvi. 38. The sorrows of hell, as is elsewhere
mentioned, encompassed him. Ps. xviii. 5. My soul, pause over this. Was
Jesus's soul thus sorrowful, even with hell sorrows, when, from the sins
of his people charged on him, and the penalty exacted from him as the
sinner's surety, the wrath of God against sin, lighting upon him, came
as the tremendous vengeance of hell? Mark describes the state of the
Lamb of God as "sore amazed." The expression signifies the horror of
mind; such a degree of fear and consternation as when the hairs of the
head stand upright, through the dread of the mind. And was Jesus thus
agonized, and for sins his holy soul had never committed, when standing
forth as the surety of others? John's expression of the Redemer's state
on this occasion is, that he said," his soul was troubled." John xii.
27. The original of this word troubled, is the same as the Latins derive
their word for hell from. As if the Lord Jesus felt what the prophet had
said concerning everlasting burnings. Isa. xxxiii. 14. "My heart," said
that patient sufferer, "is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my
bowels." Ps. xxii. 14. Hence Moses, and after him Paul, in the view of
God's taking vengeance on sin, describe him under that awful
account—"our God is a consuming fire" Deut. iv. 24. Heb. xii. 29.
Beholding his Father thus coming forth to punish sin in his person,
Jesus said—"Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, therefore my heart
faileth me," Ps. xl. 12. And Luke folds up the account of Jesus with
"being in an agony;" such a labouring of nature as implies an universal
convulsion, as dying men with cold clammy sweats: so Jesus, scorched
with the hot wrath of God on sin, sweated, in his angony, clots of
blood! My soul, canst thou hold out any longer? Will not thine
eye-strings and heart-strings break, thus to look on Jesus in his
agony!. Oh precious Jesus! were the great objects of insensible,
inanimated nature, made to feel as if to take part in thy sufferings;
and am I unmoved? Did the very grave yawn at thy death and resurrection;
and were the rocks rent, while my tearless eyes thus behold thee? Oh
gracious God, fulfil that promise by the prophet," that I may look on
him whom I have pierced, and mourn as one that mourneth for his only
son, and be in bitterness as one that is in bitterness for his
first-born."</p>

<p>"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple
robe. And Pilate saith unto them, behold the man."—John xix. 5.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, thou art engaged in solemn subjects at
this season, both night and morning; and here is one as solemn as any;
thy Jesus coming forth in his coronation robes! Yes! For he, and he
alone, is the prince of sufferers, as the prince of his people. Many of
his dear children have been beset with thorns; and to many, indeed to
all more or less, the Lord hedgeth up their way with thorns. But none
but the ever blessed Jesus was </span><span
class="c6">crowned</span><span class="c5"> with thorns. Now, my soul,
ponder well the solemn subject. And Oh! that God the Holy Ghost may open
all the glories of it to thy view. And </span><span
class="c6">first</span><span class="c5">, look at thy Jesus, crowned
with thorns. None but the Lord Jesus could properly wear this crown;
because the curse pronounced by God at the fall, of thorns being brought
forth </span><span class="c6">to the man</span><span class="c5">, could
belong to none but him, the God-man Christ Jesus. This curse contained
an abridgment of all the curses in the bible: and which never fell upon
any but the person of Christ, so as to </span><span
class="c6">crown</span><span class="c5"> him as having suffered all. He
was first made sin, and then a curse for his redeemed. Now the
</span><span class="c6">three</span><span class="c5"> grand branches of
this curse were never fulfilled in any but in Christ: as, </span><span
class="c6">first</span><span class="c5">, a separation from God;
</span><span class="c6">secondly</span><span class="c5">, a state of
unequalled sorrow, subject to all the frailties of nature, in pain and
misery; and </span><span class="c6">thirdly</span><span class="c5">,
death: in dying he died; intimating thereby the </span><span
class="c6">very death</span><span class="c5">, as comprehensive of all
in one. All men in death are exposed to a cold and </span><span
class="c6">clammy</span><span class="c5"> sweat; but it was reserved to
the Lord Jesus, in his death, to sweat a </span><span
class="c6">bloody</span><span class="c5"> sweat. My soul! do thou thus
look at him, in his purple robe, and crown of thorns, who is here
represented to thy view, and never, never forget, that in all this he
was and is thy surety; the Lord thy righteousness! But there is another
point to be regarded in this solemn scripture, which demands thy closest
attention; and let this form a </span><span
class="c6">second</span><span class="c5"> delightful consideration for
thy evening's comforts. When Jesus thus came forth, wearing the crown of
thorns, and the purple robe, as the translation represents the passage;
it is Pilate who saith, "Behold the man!" But this is a mistake, and a
sad mistake indeed: for it is not Pilate that speaks, but Christ. The
word </span><span class="c6">Pilate</span><span class="c5">, if you well
observe, is printed in italics, which denotes that it is a word not
found in the original, but put in by another hand; and much to be
lamented it is, that it should ever have been there. The Lord Jesus
Christ had been all along pointed out in the old testament scripture as
</span><span class="c6">the man</span><span class="c5">, the very man,
that should be "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;" who should
give his back to the smiters, and his cheek to them that plucked off his
hair, and that would not hide his face from shame and spitting. When,
therefore, Pilate brought the Lord Jesus to the view of his people, in
direct and full testimony as answerable to those characters; Jesus saith
unto them, "Behold the man!" He had before, under the spirit of
prophecy, cried out, "Behold me! behold me!" (Isaiah Ixv. 1.) and now,
as if to shew the wonderful and complete agreement of scripture prophecy
with his sacred person, he saith, "Behold the man!" Oh! how blessed is
it to receive this testimony from Jesus's own mouth! Oh! how refreshing
to the soul, to perceive Christ's gracious attention, in such a moment
of trial, to the security and comfort of his people! And what a blessed
strengthening to the faith of his redeemed, to behold all the persons Of
the Godhead calling upon the church to the same contemplation! "Behold
(saith God the Father) my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my
soul delighteth?" Isa. xlii. 1. Behold (saith God the Holy Ghost) the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" John i. 29.
"Behold the man!" saith Christ himself, as in this most blessed
scripture. Lord Jesus! give me to behold thee, with an eye of faith, and
so to gaze, with holy joy, and wonder, love, and praise, upon thy
glories, that my ravished soul may go forth in longing desires after
thee, and thus daily behold thee, until faith be swallowed up in sight,
and hope be lost in absolute fruition!</span></p>

6—Morning—John 18:4-6</h3>
<p>"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went
forth, and said unto them, whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of
Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed
him, stood with them. As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he,
they went backward and fell to the ground."—John xviii, 4, 5, 6.</p>
<p>What a glorious scripture is this! Ponder it well, my soul; for of
all the miracles of thy, Jesus, there is not one more sweet and
satisfactory to contemplate. Yesterday thou wast looking at thy Redeemer
under a heavy cloud. Look at him as he is here represented, for he is
still, in this transaction, in the same garden of Gethsemane; and behold
how the Godhead shone forth with a glory surpassing all description.
Observe what a willing sacrifice was Jesus. He knew the hour was come,
for he had said so. He doth not wait to be taken, and by wicked hands to
be crucified and slain: but he goeth forth to surrender himself. Yes!
Jesus did not go to the garden of Gethsemane for nothing; he knew Judas
would be there; he knew the powers of darkness would be there; he knew
his whole soul would be in an agony; but there Jesus would go. He had
said at the table of his disciples," Arise, let us go hence. "Precious,
precious Jesus! how endearing to my poor soul is this sweet view of thy
readiness and earnestness to become a sacrifice for the sins of thy
people. Thou hast this baptism, Lord, to be baptised with; and how wast
thou straitened until it was accomplished! There was a time, dear Lord,
when the multitudes sought for thee to make thee a king; so convinced
were they, for the moment, who thou wert; and then thou didst hide
thyself from them. But now thine enemies come to make thee king with a
crown of thorns, and to nail thy sacred body to the cross, thou didst
hasten to meet them. Well might the prophet say, thou wentest forth for
the salvation of thy people. Look at this scripture again, my soul.
"Whom seek ye?" said Jesus. Did they not know him? It was a light night,
most probably; for the moon was then at the full; besides, the seekers
of Christ had lanterns and torches. How was it they did not know him?
Didst thou for the moment, dearest Lord, do by them as thine angels at
the gate of Lot by the Sodomites, so cause their eyes to be holden that
they should not know thee? Was there somewhat of a miracle in this also?
But, my soul, behold the wonder of wonders that followed: no sooner had
Jesus said to their inquiry, (whom seek ye) "I am he," than they went
backward and fell to the ground. Was there indeed some sudden
overpowering emanation of the Godhead, breaking through the vail of
Jesus's flesh, which induced this effect? Was it ever known, ever heard
of, in any age or period of the world, of such an effect before?
Supposing all the monarchs of the earth, with the mightiest armies of
men, could be assembled together, how should such an event be induced by
the breath of their mouth? Contemplate this, my soul, again and again
Rejoice, my soul, in this view of thy Saviour; for never, surely, was a
greater miracle of thy Redeemer's wrought; and remember how soon it took
place after his agony. Never go to Gethsemane in meditation, without
taking the recollection of it with thee. "Behold the man!" behold the
God! Here was nothing exercised by Jesus; no weapon, no threat, no
denunciation, no appeal to the Father. Jesus only simply said, "I am
he," and they fell to the earth. Precious Jesus, what a volume of
instruction doth it afford. If such was the effect in the day of thy
flesh, how sure is that scripture concerning the day of thy power, in
which it is said," The Lord shall consume the wicked with the breath of
his mouth, and destroy them with the brightness of his coming. "2 Thess.
ii. 8. And if, my soul, there was such power in the word of thy Saviour,
when he only said to his enemies, "I am he," why shouldest thou not feel
all the sweetness and gracious power of his love, when he saith, "Fear
not, I am he; behold I am with thee: it is I; be not afraid." Ponder, my
soul, in this view also, the awful state of a soul hardened by sin. The
enemies of Jesus, though they fell to the ground at his mere word, felt
no change, no compunction, at the display of it. Judas also was with
them. Yes! he fell also; but Satan had entered into him, and a reprobate
mind marked him as the son of perdition. Oh precious Jesus! how fully
read to thy people, in every part of thy word, is the solemn truth, that
grace makes all the difference between him that serveth God, and him
that serveth him not. Oh keep me, Lord, and I shall be well kept; for
unto thee do I lift up my soul!</p>

6—Evening—Matthew 27:33</h3>
<p>"A place called Golgotha?"—Matt. xxvii. 33.</p>
<p>And wherefore called Golgotha? It was "a place of skulls;" not a
charnel house; not a sepulchre for the great; but probably where a
number of unburied skulls of poor criminals lay together, or scattered
here and there, as the feet of those who visited this place of sorrow,
might kick them. Luke calls it Calvary, (Luke xxiii. 33,) but both mean
one and the same place. And was this a suited place for thee, Oh thou
Lord of life and glory? Yes, blessed Jesus! if thou wilt become sin, and
a curse for thy redeemed; then, surely, this of all places becomes thee,
where thy people must have lain for ever, hadst thou not interposed, and
undertaken all that behoved them to suffer, that they might be made "the
righteousness of God in thee? My soul, did Jesus suffer at Golgotha? Go
thou forth to him "without the camp, bearing his reproach." And is this
Golgotha? And was it here that Jesus "then restored that which he took
not away?" Oh! how blessed the review! how memorable, how sacred the
spot! Who would have thought that a place so wretched should have
produced so much good! Confusion had been introduced into all the works
of God, by reason of sin; here Jesus restored perfect order to all.
God's glory had been tarnished; God's law had been broken; God's justice
despised. At Golgotha, Jesus restored all. And as man had lost the image
of God, the favour of God, the acquaintance with God: at this memorable
spot, Jesus restored to God his glory, and to man God's favour. My soul!
do thou often visit the place called Golgotha; and to endear the sacred
haunt still more, look at thy Lord as thou goest thither, and figure to
thyself thy Jesus going with thee. Here it was that his person and all
his sacred offices were blasphemed. Is Jesus the Lord God of the
prophets? Then will the rabble vilify his prophetical office.
"Prophecy," say they, "thou Christ, who is he that smote thee!" Is Jesus
the great High Priest of Jehovah, after the order of Melchisedec? This
also shall be despised. "Save thyself and us," said the scoffing
multitude. And is Jesus a king? "Come down then," say they, "from the
cross, and we will believe." Yea, and as the most aggravating
circumstance of cruelty, and which, as far as I have ever heard, or
read, was never practised upon the most abject criminal, his very
prayers were turned into ridicule. "My God, my God," said the holy
sufferer, "why hast thou forsaken me!" "This man calleth for Elias,"
said they; "let us see whether Elias will come to take him down!" Pause,
my soul! over the solemn view: and as thou takest thine evening stand at
Golgotha, ask thine heart, is this Jesus, who is "the brightness of his
Father's glory, and the express image of his person?" Is this He, whom
angels worship, and at whose name "every knee shall bow, of things in
heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth?" Oh! thou
bleeding Lamb, that art now in the midst of the throne! often let my
soul ruminate over the affecting scenes of Golgotha. Solemn is the
place, but blessed also. Here would I sit down, and as I contemplate
Jesus, in this endearing part of his character, I would hear his voice,
speaking in the tenderest manner, "Is it nothing to you, all ye that
pass by? Behold, and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day
of his fierce anger."</p>

7—Morning—Isaiah 53:12</h3>
<p>"He hath poured out his soul unto death."—Isaiah llii. 12.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! from the garden to the cross, follow
Jesus. Behold him apprehended and hurried away, both to judgment and to
death. He who struck to the ground the band that came to take him, might
surely, by the same breath of his mouth, have struck them to hell, and
prevented his being apprehended by them. But one of the sweetest and
most blessed parts of Jesus's redemption of his people, consisted in the
freeness and willingness of his sacrifice. Yes, thou precious Lamb of
God! no man (as thou thyself hadst before said) had power to take thy
life from thee; but thou didst lay it down thyself: thou hadst power to
lay it down, and thou hadst power to take it again. Delightful
consideration, to thee, my soul! Now, my soul, let this day's meditation
be sacred to the view of thy Redeemer pouring out his </span><span
class="c6">soul</span><span class="c5"> unto death. And to-morrow, if
the Lord give thee to see the morrow, let the solemn subject of thy
study be the sufferings of Jesus in his </span><span
class="c6">body</span><span class="c5">. Pause then, my soul, and call
up all the powers of thy mind to the contemplation of what the scripture
teacheth concerning thy Redeemer's pouring out his soul unto death. Seek
the teachings of the Holy Ghost in this solemn and mysterious subject.
The original curse pronounced on the fall, which Jesus took upon
himself, and came to do away, contained somewhat vastly great. For as
the blessing promised to obedience," Do this, and thou shalt live,"
certainly meant somewhat much greater than mere animal life, and implied
sweet fellowship and communion with God; so the curse to disobedience,
"Dying, thou shalt die," as plainly intimated much more than the mere
return of the body to the dust out of which it was taken: it meant what
in scripture (Rev. xx. 6.) is called the "second death," meaning hell
and everlasting misery. Hence, in the recovery of our lost and fallen
nature from this awful state, when Jesus undertook the salvation of his
people, he was to sustain all that was our due; and, in the
accomplishment of this, he not only died in his body, but he poured out
his soul unto death. As the sinner's representative, and the sinner's
surety, he bore the whole weight and pressure of divine justice due to
sin; according to what the Holy Ghost taught—"Indignation and wrath,
tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil."—Rom,
ii. 9. Not that the Redeemer needed, in the accomplishment of this, to
go down into hell to suffer the miseries of the damned; for when the
avenging wrath of God came upon him, he endured it here. The wrath of
God may be sustained in earth as well as hell: witness the evil spirit
that is called the prince of the power of the air, Ephes. ii. 2; for
wherever the apostate angels are, they still endure divine wrath. Hence,
when the Lord Christ poured out his soul unto death, by reason of the
extremity of his soul sufferings, and soul's traval! for his redeemed,
he sustained all this as the sinner's surety, in becoming sin and a
curse, to feel and suffer all that was the sinner's due. Oh! who shall
say, what heart shall conceive, the greatness and extensiveness of thy
sufferings, precious, precious Lamb of God! Oh! who shall undertake
fully to shew the infinite suitableness of Jesus to every poor humble
convinced sinner, in deliveriug him from the wrath to come! Here, my
soul, fix thine eyes; here let all thy powers be employed in the
unceasing contemplation, while beholding Jesus, thy Jesus, "pouring out
his soul unto death; while numbered with the transgressors, and bearing
the sin of many, and making intercession for the transgressors.

7—Evening—Mark 15:28</h3>
<p>"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, and he was numbered
with the transgressors."Mark xv. 28.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Look up, my soul, to the cross, and behold thy Lord
hanging with two thieves; yea, in the middle of them, as if the greatest
malefactor of the three; and, what is the most awful part of the
subject, not only was he thus considered by the Jewish rabble, but as
the sinner's representative, Jesus was thus beheld in Jehovah's view;
"numbered with the transgressors," and virtually, the great surety and
sponsor of them all. Pause, my soul, as thou readest this scripture, and
as thou beholdest it fulfilled on the cross. Will it not undeniably
follow, that if Christ was so reckoned, and so numbered, then must it
have been, not for himself, for he had no sin, but for his people; and
if made sin and a curse, surely he hath taken away both sin and the
curse, by the sacrifice of himself, that they might be made the
righteousness of God in him? There is one circumstance in this
representation of Jesus being reckoned with the transgressors, as a sin
and a curse, yea, sustaining the whole of sin and the curse in his own
sacred person, that is particularly striking; I mean, that amidst all
the shadowy representations under the law, the only type on this
subject, and a most decisive one it was; is that of "the brazen
serpent." Of all the creatures of God's creation, it was the serpent
only that was pronounced cursed at the fall; and therefore, though the
blood of many beasts may be, and indeed was made typical of redemption
by the sacrifice of Christ, yet none but the serpent could represent
Christ as a curse for his people. There is somewhat very striking in
this. Christ, in redeeming us from the curse of the law, must be
represented as a curse for us: the serpent therefore, the cursed beast,
shall be lifted up in the wilderness; and Jesus himself will graciously
explain it: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must
the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him shall not
perish, but have eternal life:" John iii. 14, 15. What a wonderful
event! Who, but for the scripture, and the teaching of the Holy Ghost,
would have been able to trace, the affinity? "My righteous servant,"
saith Jehovah, "shall justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities."
He is therefore </span><span class="c6">numbered</span><span class="c5">
with the </span><span class="c6">transgressors</span><span class="c5">,
Isaiah liii. 11, 12. And agreeably to this, all the circumstances
attending this sustaining of the curse, shall correspond: a drop of
water is denied to none but the cursed in hell; Jesus, therefore, in his
thirst, shall be denied it also. If malefactors under the curse have no
one to mitigate their sorrows, here again Jesus shall be the same; for
in his sufferings, "all his disciples forsook him, and fled." Is the
darkness in hell an aggravation of the miseries of the cursed there?
Thus also shall it be in the extreme agonies of Jesus; for darkness
covered the earth during his crucifixion, from the sixth to the ninth
hour. Yea, and above all, the sense of divine manifestation shall be
withdrawn, as from those in the regions of everlasting misery, who have
no sense of the divine presence, but in his wrath. So that Jesus needed
not to go down into hell to suffer the torments of the damned; for being
numbered with the transgressors, and standing forth to the view of
Jehovah, as sin and a curse for his people, the waters of the great deep
were broken up, to overwhelm his precious soul; and in those tremendous
hours, all the cataracts of divine wrath were poured out upon him, until
the holy patient sufferer was constrained to cry out in that dolorous
cry, "All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me!" Psalm xlii. 7.
Lamb of God! is it thus at Golgotha thou weft numbered with the
transgressors? And was it thus that the scripture was fulfilled? Oh, for
grace so to behold thee, so to fix and feast my soul upon thee, that,
while conscious that thy holy soul knew no sin, though made sin for me,
I, who know no righteousness, and truly have none, may be made the
righteousness of God in thee!</span></p>

8—Morning—Philippians 2:8</h3>
<p>"He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death
of the cross."—Philip. ii. 8.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, dost thou not feel, at every step towards
Calvary, somewhat of the angel's words when he cried," One woe is past,
and behold there come two woes more hereafter? "Rev. ix. 12. Surely,
never was there a manifestation of the holiness of Jehovah, nor the
utter detestation of God against sin, as was set forth in the
crucifixion of Jesus. Would men, would angels, see what sin really is,
let them go to the cross of Jesus. The casting rebellious angels out of
heaven, the curse pronounced upon the earth, the drowning the old world
by water, the burning of Sodom by fire; nay, the millions of miseries
among men, and the unquenchable fire of hell; though all these may make
the souls of the awakened exclaim against sin, yet all these are slight
and inconsiderable things, compared to the wrath of God poured out upon
the person of God's own Son, when he died the accursed death of the
cross. My soul, take thy stand this day at the foot of the cross. Behold
the Lamb of God! There see divine justice more awfully displayed than
would have been in the everlasting ruin of all creation. And Oh may it
be thy portion, my soul, while looking unto Jesus, to say as Paul did—"I
am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the
faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. "But, my
soul, while thou lookest up to Jesus hanging on the painful tree,
contemplate the sufferings of the Lord Jesus in his sacred body. The
death of the cross was a </span><span class="c6">violent</span><span
class="c5"> death; for as there was no sin in Jesus, there could not
have been those seeds of death, which in all the race of Adam, are found
to bring forth fruit unto death. Precious thought this, even in the
moment of beholding Jesus's life taken by violence. Had Jesus not died
by a violent death, he would have been no sacrifice; for that which died
of itself naturally, could not by the law have been offered to God. The
death of Jesus was also a </span><span class="c6">cursed</span><span
class="c5"> death; for it is written," Cursed is every one that hangeth
on a tree. "Behold, my soul, thy Lord thus lifted up a spectacle between
heaven and earth, as if cursed and despised both of God and man. The
death of Jesus was a </span><span class="c6">painful</span><span
class="c5"> death, in which many deaths were, as it were, contained in
one. The nails driven through the most feeling parts of the hands and
feet, and the body stretched forth on the transverse timber; in this
manner the cross, with the Lord Jesus fastened upon it, was lifted up in
the air, until the bottom fell into its socket, which suddenly shook the
whole and every part of his sacred body; and thus the whole weight
hanging on his pierced nailed hands, the wounds in both hands and feet
by degrees widened as he hung, until at length he expired in tortures.
Precious, precious Redeemer! was it thus thou didst offer thy soul an
offering for sin? Was there no method, in all the stores of Omnipotency,
for satisfying divine justice, but by thy holy, harmless, undefiled body
dying the violent, cursed, painful death of the cross? Oh by the crimson
fountain of thy blood, which issued from thy pierced side, enable me to
sit down, day by day, until I find my whole nature crucified with thee
in all its affections and lusts. Let there be somewhat, dearest Lord, of
an holy conformity between my Lord and me; and if Jesus died
</span><span class="c6">for</span><span class="c5"> sin; may my soul die
</span><span class="c6">to</span><span class="c5"> sin; that by
mortifying the deeds of the body I may live; and by carrying about with
me always the dying of the Lord Jesus, the life also of Jesus may be
made manifest in my mortal body.</span></p>

8—Evening—Mark 15:44</h3>
<p>"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead."Mark xv. 44.</p>
<p>Precious Jesus! had the unjust judge but known thy soul travail and
agonies, instead of wondering at the speediness of thy death, all his
astonishment would have been that nature, so oppressed, and so
suffering, could have held out so long; for what would have crushed in a
moment all creation, as well angels as men, in sustaining the wrath of
God, due to sin, Jesus endured on the cross for so many hours! In point
of suffering, he wrought out a whole eternity due to sin, on the cross:
and in point of efficacy, he "for ever perfected them that are
sanctified." Jesus therefore accomplished more in that memorable day,
than all the creatures of God could have done for ever. Wonderful were
the works which God dispatched in creation; but the wonders of
redemption far exceed them. The six hours which Jesus hung upon the
cross, wrought out a more stupendous display of almighty power and
grace, than the six days God was pleased to appoint to himself in making
the world. But, indeed, Pilate need not, on another account, have
marvelled at the quickness of Christ's death, had this unjust judge but
reflected on the previous sufferings of the Redeemer. They who have
spent sweet hours in tracing Jesus's footsteps through the painful
preludes to his death, and especially in the concluding scenes, have
been able to mark many a sorrowful part which (besides the soul agonies
of Jesus in accomplishing redemption-work) bore hard upon his body also.
My soul, if thou wert to trace back the solemn subject, thou wouldest
find enough to excite thy astonishment that Jesus lived so long on the
cross, rather than that he died not before. His agony evidently began
four days before the passover. The evangelist Luke tells us, that he
spent the whole night in prayer, and the whole day in preaching to the
people in the temple, Luke xxi. 37, 38. Read also Matthew's account four
days before his crucifixion, in the prospect of what was coming on,
Matt. xx. 18, 19. And again, before a single assault was made upon him
in the garden, Matt. xxvi. 38. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful," said
the dying Lamb," even unto death. "And the beloved apostle's relation is
to the same amount, four days before his crucifixion: "Now is my soul
troubled (said the holy sufferer); and what shall I say? Father, save me
from this hour! But for this cause came I unto this hour!" John xii. 27.
And if to these agonies of soul, before the tremendous season of
Gethsemane and Golgotha arrived, be added the exercises of the Redeemer
in body; all must have contributed to wear out and exhaust his strength,
and hasten on the pains of death. When we call to mind how the Lamb of
God was driven to and fro; hurried from one place to another; from Annas
to Caiaphas, and from the judgment hall to Calvary; we cannot be
surprised at his fainting under the burden of the cross. Many a mile of
weariness did he walk, before nine of the o'clock in the morning of the
day of his crucifixon; and many a bodily fainting must he have felt from
the thorny crown, the soldiers scourging, and their buffetings and
smitings with the palms of their hands. Unfeeling Pilate! thy
marvellings will be now, and to all eternity, of another kind. As for
thee, my soul, take thy stand at the foot of the cross, and do thou
marvel, whilst thou art looking up, and beholding Jesus dying, that He
who might have commanded twelve legions of angels to his rescue, should
in love to his church and people, thus give "his soul an offering for
sin," and die," the just for the unjust, to bring us unto God!</p>

9—Morning—Luke 23:34</h3>
<p>"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do."—Luke xxiii. 34.</p>
<p>My soul, art thou still taking thy stand at the foot of the cross?
Art thou still looking up to Jesus? If so, listen now to his voice.
There were seven expressions of Jesus, which were his last words, which
he uttered on the cross. The last words of dying friends are
particularly regarded: how much more the last words of the best of all
friends; even the dying friend of poor lost perishing sinners. Those
which I have chosen for the portion of the day were the first; and they
contain the strong cry of Jesus to his Father for forgiveness to his
murderers. And what endears those expressions yet more to the heart are,
that they are not only the first upon the cross, but they are wholly,
not for himself, but the people. During the whole painful process of
suffering, when they scourged him, crowned him with thorns, smote him
with their hands, and mocked him, we hear no voice of complaint. "He was
led as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before her shearers is
dumb, so he opened not his mouth." Precious, meek Lamb of God! But now,
when lifted up on the cross, Jesus broke silence, and cried out,
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Pause, my soul.
Look again at the cross. Was not Jesus now entered upon his high
priest's office? Was not the cross as the altar from whence the
sacrifice was offered? Was not Jesus himself the sacrifice? And was not
Jesus the sacrificer? Might not the pale, the dying, whitened visage of
Jesus be compared to the white ephod of the high priest; the streaming
blood, flowing over his sacred body from the several wounds, as the
incense of his censer; and the dying sweat of his holy frame, like the
smoke ascending with the sweetest savour before God? As the arms of
Jesus, when he thus prayed, were stretched forth on the cross, so the
high priest spread forth his hands, when burning the incense for
sacrifice, in pleading for the people. Hail, thou glorious high priest!
in this the humblest moment, and the most powerful of thine
intercessions. Surely every wound of thine, every look, every feature,
every groan, pleaded with open mouth this gracious intercession for
forgiveness of sinners. Lord, was I not included in the prayer? Was not
the eye of Jesus upon me in the moment of this all-prevailing advocacy?
Oh ye of every description and character, that still sit unconcerned and
unmoved at this cry of the Son of God, "is it nothing to you, all ye
that pass by?" Think, my poor unawakened brother, how justly that voice
might have been heard for all the enemies of Jesus—"Depart from me, ye
cursed;" when the tender language of Jesus was, "Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do." And think, moreover, that the same
gracious voice is still heard in heaven, and of the same blessed force
and efficacy as ever; for while our sins are calling for judgment, the
blood of Jesus calls louder for mercy. Dear Lord, let this first cry of
thine upon the cross, be the first and last of all my thoughts, under
every exercise and temptation of sin and Satan—"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

9—Evening—Isaiah 53:11</h3>
<p>"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
satisfied."—Isaiah liii. 11.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Is not this covenant promise of thy faithful God
and Father peculiarly suited, my soul, for thine evening meditation,
after the subject of the morning, in contemplating the first cry of
Jesus upon the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do?" And was not the cry answered in the case of the Jerusalem sinners
at the day of Pentecost, soon after, when, under the apostle Peter's
sermon, they were pricked to the heart, and cried out, "Men and
brethren, what shall we do?" Acts ii. 23, 37. Ponder over the solemn
expression, </span><span class="c6">the travail</span><span class="c5">
of the Redeemer's soul. Did Jesus really sustain in soul somewhat like
those throes of nature with which a woman is exercised in her hour of
extremity? Did he travail in birth for his redeemed?—Pause, my soul, and
very solemnly consider the subject. If the eighteenth Psalm be supposed
to contain prophetical allusions to Christ, we may therein discover
somewhat which will be helpful in this study: "The sorrows of hell
compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me;" Psalm xviii. 5.
We have similar expressions, Psalm cxvi. 3. As therefore these strong
terms are very highly descriptive of suffering, and of a peculiar kind,
it may be well to inquire farther, whether there be any ground to make
application of them in reference to this subject? Now it is worthy
remark, that the curses pronounced by God at the fall, upon Adam and his
wife, became distinct acts of suffering; and it should seem, that he,
who, in after ages, was to take away sin and the curse from both, must
do it by suffering for both, in order to deliver them from it. My soul,
review them: "Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy
sorrow, and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children :
and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And
unto Adam he said, because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy
wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, thou
shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt
thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also and thistles shall
it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground;
for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
thou return;" Gen. iii. 16 to 19. Now, that Jesus, in his own sacred
person, literally and truly bore every title of this sentence as it
referred to Adam, none, who have read the history of the blessed Jesus
in the gospels, can for a moment question. So much in sorrow did Jesus
eat his bread, that he, and he alone, by way of emphasis, must be
peculiarly called, "The man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." And
he it was that was crowned with thorns, by way of eminency in
affliction, and sweat a bloody sweat; and he said himself, "Thou hast
brought me into the dust of death," Psalm xxii. 15. But unless we can
trace a similarity of Jesus bearing in his own sacred person somewhat in
reference to the woman also, how shall we see the curse removed, and the
sentence done away? Hence, if the travail of soul spoken of by the Lord,
through the prophet, be intended to allude to the Lord Jesus bringing
forth his sons to glory (and wherefore it should not, cannot be shewn),
then have we a most gracious and beautiful representation folded up in
this scripture; and the promise connected with it is equally delightful.
And may we not interpret that scripture of another prophet by this
illustration: "Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with
child? Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a
woman in travail, and all faces, are turned into paleness? Alas! for
that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of
Jacob's trouble: but he shall be saved out of it;" Jer. xxx. 6, 7.
Precious Jesus! thou art indeed the man, the God-man, that didst travail
for thy children; and while all faces are turned into paleness by reason
of sin, thou, our glorious Jacob, our Israel, Jehovah's servant, in the
day, the great day of thy soul travail, shalt be saved out of it, and
shalt see of the travail of thy soul, and be satisfied. Yea, Lord, thou
wilt remember no more thine anguish, for joy that the dew of thy birth
is as incalculable as the drops of the morning. Hail! Almighty Lord! the
trophies of thy redemption shall correspond to the greatness of thy
name: "men shall be blessed in thee, and all nations shall call thee
blessed." Amen.</span></p>

10—Morning—John 19:26, 27</h3>
<p>"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by,
whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, woman, behold thy son. Then
saith he to the disciple, behold thy mother."—John xix. 26, 27.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> This was the </span><span
class="c6">second</span><span class="c5"> among the dying words of the
Lord Jesus; and no doubt, of high importance in their full sense and
meaning: not simply to recommend Mary to the care of the beloved
apostle, John, but probably of greater moment in reference to the church
of Jesus at large. My soul, is it not very certain that the Lord Jesus
knew all the events which would take place in all generations of his
people? And as such, did not Jesus perfectly well know also that the
time would come when divine honours would be offered to Mary? These
points cannot be disputed. Well then, is it not worthy the closest
observation, that Jesus both in this place, and upon all other
occasions, when speaking of Mary, called her woman? Why so? If, as Jesus
knew, that there would be some who would pray to her, and call her
mother of God, by which name the Holy Ghost never, distinguished her,
neither the Lord Jesus himself; could there have been a more decided
method adopted than this to discountenance such idolatry, than when
Jesus, in his dying moments, called Mary only woman? Besides, was it not
on another account, that as Jesus was to be the seed of the woman, which
was promised to bruise the serpent's head, such a dying testimony might
serve instead of a thousand witnesses, in proof of the confirmation of
the fact: and Mary's song might be the song of thousands—"My soul doth
magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God </span><span
class="c6">my Saviour!</span><span class="c5">" But when we have thus
attended to the second cry of Christ upon the cross, in reference to
those sweet points, do thou, my soul, remember alse how tenderly those
expressions of thy Lord recommend all the endearing affections of love
and regard through all the members of Christ's mystical body. To behold
our mother, or to behold our sons, are only different expressions to
intimate that all true believers in Jesus are members of one another,
and of his body, his flesh, and his bones. And as it was by our Lord
himself in this life, so is it with all his redeemed, both in this life
and in that which is to come; they who do the will of his Father, which
is in heaven, the same are Christ's brethren, and sisters, and
mother.</span></p>

10—Evening—Zechariah 13:7</h3>
<p>"Awake, 0 sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my
fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall
be scattered."—Zech, xiii. 7.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> That this blessed scripture points to Christ, and
to him only, the Lord Jesus himself fully confirmed in his discourse
with his disciples at the Mount of Olives, Matt. xxvi. 31. And indeed of
whom could Jehovah thus speak, as "fellow to the Lord of Hosts," but to
Him, who, "though in the form of God, and with whom it was no robbery to
be equal with God, yet took upon him the form of a servant, and was made
in the likeness of men?" But what call is this to the sword? Was it the
flaming sword at the gate of Paradise, which was placed there to guard
the way to the tree of life? And had the sword been for so many ages
sleeping? Could none presume to enter but Jesus? And if he enters, the
sword of God's justice must first awake, and be sheathed in his heart?
And is it God the Father himself that thus commands the sword to awake,
and smite his only begotten Son? Did God indeed so love the world, that
he thus gave his only begotten Son, "to the end that all who believe in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life?" Pause, my soul, over
these solemn, but blessed thoughts. And is he God, on whom these things
are to be transacted? Yes; for he is "fellow to the Lord of Hosts." And
is he man also? Yes; for "the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us!"
Such is the mystery of godliness; "God manifest in the flesh!" And,
what! is he both God and man in one person? Yes; for so only could he be
Christ. Well might the prophet exclaim, "Wonder, O heavens, and be
astonished, O earth!"—My soul! take thy stand, this evening, at the foot
of the cross, and contemplate, among the prodigies of that memorable
day, that great wonder concerning Him crucified, who was fellow to the
Lord of Hosts. View both his natures: He was truly and properly
</span><span class="c6">man</span><span class="c5">; for it was one
express article in the covenant of redemption, that "as by man came
death, by man should come also the resurrection of the dead. And as by
the disobedience of one many were made sinners, so by the obedience of
one should many be made righteous." Moreover, the first promise of the
bible, which came in with the fall, was express to this purpose: "The
seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head." The devil had
triumphed over the nature of man in the fall; and the same nature of man
was promised to conquer death, hell, and the grave: and as both the law
and the justice of God were solemnly concerned that the same nature
which had rebelled should obey, and the same nature which had sinned
should atone; and all the divine perfections were concerned, that he who
undertook the purposes of redemption, should be the man that was fellow
to the Lord of Hosts, even Christ Jesus. Secondly, as none but man could
be suited for a Redeemer, so none but God could be competent to
accomplish redemption. Hence he must be fellow to the Lord of Hosts. In
point of dignity, in point of merit, the glory due to a Redeemer when
redemption should be accomplished, and the adoration, love, and praise
to be ascribed to him, could never be suitable to any less than God.
Hence by the union of both natures, Jesus, and Jesus only, who thus
formed one Christ, became the very person here described, and was, and
is, and ever must be, "the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of
Hosts." Now, my soul, whenever thou lookest up to the cross, (let it be
daily, hourly, continually, yea, unceasingly) never lose sight of this
glorious union of God and man in thy Jesus. Fix thine eyes, thine heart,
thy whole affection upon him; and while thou art resting all thine
assurance of pardon, mercy, and peace, the joy of this life, and the
glory of that which is to come, wholly upon thy Jesus; Oh! let thine ear
of faith receive in transports of delight, the proclamation of God thy
Father concerning Him, "the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of
Hosts."</span></p>

11—Morning—Luke 23:43</h3>
<p>"And Jesus said unto him, verily I say, unto thee, today shalt thou
be with me in Paradise."—Luke xxiii. 43.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, hear the gracious words of thy Jesus. This
was the </span><span class="c6">third</span><span class="c5"> cry of the
Redeemer on the cross. And Oh! how full of grace, rich, free, unmerited,
unexpected, unlooked-for grace, to a poor lost perishing sinner, even in
the very moment of death. Let. the self-righteous pharisee behold this
example of redeeming love, and wonder, and be confounded. Surely no one
will venture to suppose that this man's good works were any
recommendation, when the poor wretch was dying under the hands of
justice. What was it then that saved him but the complete salvation of
Jesus? The Son of God was offering his soul on the cross a sacrifice for
sin, and being between two notorious sinners, gave a rich display of the
sovereignty of his grace, and his love to poor sinners; and in
confirmation, snatched this one as a brand from the burning—took him
from the very jaws of hell, and that very day led him in triumph to
heaven; thereby manifesting to every poor sinner, in whose heart he puts
the cry for mercy, that, that cry shall never be put forth in vain. And
mark, my soul, how powerful, the grace of the Lord Jesus wrought upon
this man. He and his companion both knew that before night they would
both be in eternity. The thought affected neither; they joined the
rabble in insulting Jesus. "Save thyself and us," was the language of
the heart of both, until the grace of Jesus wrought on this man's mind,
and changed the reviler into an humble suitor. What could there be in
Jesus thus to affect him! Jesus hung upon the cross like a poor Jew.
Jesus had been always poor, and never more so than now. And yet, in the
midst of all these surrounding circumstances, such a ray of light broke
in upon this man's mind, that he saw Jesus in all his glory and power,
acknowledged him for a King, when all the disciples had forsook him and
fled, and prayed to be remembered by him when he came into his kingdom.
Precious Lamb of God! bestow upon me such a portion of thy grace as,
under all the unpromising circumstances around, may call forth the like
conviction of thy power, and my need. And Oh! that this pattern of mercy
might be reviewed by thousands of poor perishing dying sinners! Methinks
I would have it proclaimed through all the public places of resort,
through all the haunts of licentiousness, among the numberless scenes of
hardened sinners who fear that they have sinned beyond the possibility
of forgiveness. Oh look at this example of Jesus's love, ye that are
going down to the grave full of sin and despair! behold the thief!
behold the Saviour! And Oh for a cry of grace like-that of the dying
malefactor—"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom;" and
Jesus's gracious answer—"To-day shalt thou be with me in
paradise."</span></p>

11—Evening—Luke 23:39, 40</h3>
<p>"And one of the malefactors, which were hanged, railed on him,
saying, if thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering,
rebuked him."—Luke xxiii. 39, 40.</p>
<p>My soul! thy morning meditation was directed to that soul-reviving,
penitent, encouraging prospect, which the cross of Christ affords, in
the recovery of the thief upon the cross, as furnishing the most
illustrious example of the sovereignty of grace! Oh! what a trophy was
there of the Redeemer's conquest! Now take thy stand again at the foot
of the cross, and look on the other side, and behold the dreadful
reverse, in the obduracy of the human heart. Here view the sinner dying
in all the possibilities of a hardened conscience, railing and
blaspheming; while the other departs in the most finished act of faith
and repentance, glorifying the Lord. Pause over the contemplation, and
then ask, what was it made the mighty difference? Who made thee, my
soul, to differ from another? And what hast thou, which thou didst not
receive! Blessed Lord Jesus! I do indeed rejoice with trembling, when I
consider what! am; yea, what every man is by nature; and how resolutely
shut and bolted the hearts of all men are, in our universally fallen
state, and cannot but remain so for ever, unless thou, who hast the key
of David, dost open, and by thy sweet influences dost enter in! Pause
once more, my soul! Perhaps, among the wonders which attended the
crucifixion and death of Jesus, this, of a determined obduracy, is not
the least. Nothing can be more plain, than that a general suspicion took
place, both among the Jews and the Roman soldiers, who attended the
crucifixion of Jesus, that he was more than man. Jesus had wrought many
miracles, in confirmation of his being the Christ: and, now on the
cross, the stupendous events which took place most loudly proclaimed it.
The sun became dark at mid-day; the veil of the temple was rent in twain
by an invisible hand; the earth did quake, the rocks were rent, and
graves were opened! And to such a degree were these portentous sights
carried, that the centurion, who presided at the execution, for the
moment, felt himself so overcome with a conviction of Christ's real
character, that, unable to resist the impulse on his mind, he cried out,
and feared greatly, saying, "surely this was the Son of God!" Matt.
xxvii. 51—54. But; as if to shew the desperately wicked state of the
human heart, even these prodigies, and the renewal of them on the
morning of our Lord's resurrection, soon lost their effect, and were
considered no more. Though an earthquake ushered in the morning of
Christ's triumph over the grave; though for a while, at this, and She
presence of an angel, the Roman soldiers became as dead men; though
Christ had foretold his resurrection, and the pharisees obtained a guard
to watch the sepulchre on this account, and had it sealed with a seal,
and a stone; still, both soldiers and pharisees, when recovered from
their fright, rather than own Jesus for the Christ, will resolutely
persist to their own damnation! My soul! pause over this solemn subject,
and learn to have a proper view of the desperately wicked state of every
man's heart by nature. Learn also where to ascribe the whole of that
difference between one man and another, in the blessed effects of
distinguishing grace. But for this, neither wouldest thou have believed
in the resurrection of Jesus. That "Jesus is believed on in the world,"
is one of the wonders in the apostle's account "of the great mystery of
godliness;" I Tim. iii. 16. And however astonishingly it strikes the
mind, yet the word of God confirms the undeniable truth, that were the
devils in hell liberated from their chains, still devils would they
remain. This we learn from the solemn account in the book of
Revelations. Under the vials of God's wrath, they who have hardened
their hearts against God and his Christ, are there given up to be
hardened for ever: "In the kingdom of darkness," it is said, "they
gnawed their tongues for pain; and blasphemed the God of heaven, because
of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds; "Rev.
xvi. 8—11. Lord Jesus! give grace to all thy redeemed, in the view of
thy distinguishing love, to know our mercies, and to bless thee, as the
author of them.</p>

12—Morning—Matthew 27:46</h3>
<p>"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
Eli, lama sabacthani; that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?"—Matt. xxvii. 46.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul! Jesus had hung upon the cross now for six hours. Think
what agonies he sustained both in soul and body. The fury of hell had
broke out upon him, and in the cruelties of the men around him,
exercised upon his sacred person, manifested how extensive that fury
was. But had this been all; had God the Father smiled upon him, had the
cup of trembling been taken away, some alleviation would have taken
place in Jesus's sufferings; but so far was this from being the case,
that the heaviest load of the sorrow his holy soul sustained, was the
wrath of the Father due to sin, as the sinner's surety. Angels, no
doubt, looked on. All heaven stood amazed. And, at length, overpowered
with the fulness of sorrow and anguish of soul, the dying Lamb cried
out," My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? "Pause, my soul, while
thou hearest in the ear of faith, still vibrating in the air, the
dolorous cry; and conceive, if it be possible, what the holy, harmless,
undefiled Jesus felt, when such expressions of exquisite terror and
distress were forced from his dying lips. What forsaking was this of
Jesus by God his Father? Not the dissolving of the union between them:
not the withdrawing the arm of his strength; for Jesus still calls him,
"Eli, Eli," that is, My strong One. Not that he left him to himself;
neither that his love for Jesus was lessened: but it was the withdrawing
or withholding those sweet manifestations whereby he had sustained the
human nature of Jesus, through the whole of his incarnation. It was
beholding Jesus in this solemn season as the sinner's surety; and as
such, it was a punishing desertion; implying that as Jesus stood, or
rather hung, with all the burden of our sins, he was so deserted for
that time as we, out of Jesus, deserve to be forsaken for ever. The cry
of Jesus, the shriek of his precious soul, under this desertion,
represented the everlasting shrieks of them that are cast out of God's
gracious presence to all eternity. Here pause again, my soul. And
wouldst thou have howled this endless, pitiable cry for ever, had not
Jesus uttered it for thee once? And art thou, by virtue of it, saved
from this wrath to come? Hath Jesus both borne thy sins, carried thy
sorrows, and been forsaken of his Father, that thou mightest enjoy his
presence and favour for ever? My soul, what wilt thou render to the Lord
for all his benefits? Wilt thou not take the cup of salvation, and call
upon the name of the Lord, now thy Jesus hath for thee taken the cup of
trembling, and drank all the dregs of it? Precious, precious Redeemer,
may I never, never lose sight of thee in this part of thy sufferings
also; and especially eye thee still more when my soul is under the
hidings of God's countenance. Let me recollect, dearest Lord! that thou
hast been forsaken before thy people, and for thy people; and here, as
in all other instances, thou hast the pre-eminence, so as to sanctify
even our momentary desertions to our good and to thy glory. Yes,
precious Lord! such are the blessed effects of thy desertion, that hence
my soul learns, my God still supports, though my God may withhold his
comforts. Jesus was forsaken for a season, that my soul might not be
forsaken for ever. And grant me, dearest Lord, from thy bright example,
to cast myself wholly upon thee, as thou didst upon thy Father, when all
sensible comforts fail, convinced that thou "art the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever!"</p>

<p>"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing
was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.”—John xix. 19.</p>
<p>My soul! thou hast not yet read the inscription over the cross of
Christ, in thine evening meditations. Do not withdraw from the sacred
spot, until thou hast read it, and also, through divine teaching,
understood its blessed design. Pilate meant it in reproach: but Jehovah
over-ruled the design, to give his dear Son due honour. It was written
in the three learned languages, in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew. And it
is the best of all learning to be able to read it in the light in which
the Lord the Spirit caused it to be written. Do thou, almighty Teacher,
cause me so to read it! Pilate meant it as Christ's crime; as if to tell
the world wherefore he suffered: but, so far is the inscription itself
from notifying a crime, that it positively asserts what it was meant to
deny. Pilate wished it to be understood that Christ was punished as an
usurper: but then he should not have said that he was the king of the
Jews, but that he assumed the title; whereas he marks it as a thing
perfectly understood; "Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews. "Some of
Christ's enemies perceived this, and accordingly desired Pilate to alter
the words—"write not," say they," the king of the Jews: but that he
said, am king of the Jews. "But he who over-ruled the mind of Pilate to
write, over-ruled his mind that he should not alter. "What I have
written," said he, "I have written. "Yes, Pilate: Jesus was indeed king
of the Jews! And now that memorable scripture was fulfilled: "Yet have,
I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion;" Psalm ii. 6. Precious Lord
Jesus! thy title hath been this from everlasting; and will be to
everlasting. It is like thyself, "the same yesterday, and to-day, and
for ever!" And now, my soul, do not lose sight of the testimony of an
enemy to the kingship of thy Lord Jesus. Look at the cross now, where
thy Redeemer was publicly proclaimed king upon it; and behold how the
offence of the cross is ceased. And Oh! for grace to own Jesus now in
glory for my King, as Pilate notified to all the world that he was king,
when in the lowest humiliation upon earth. And Oh! what rapture will
break in upon the soul, when he, whom Pilate proclaimed king upon his
cross, shall come as a King upon his throne. Lift up thine head, O my
soul, and contemplate thy King, who once was crowned with thorns, now
crowned with glory, Hear what the apostle saith, and let thy whole mind
be occupied in contemplating the glory that shall be revealed: "Behold,
the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment
upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their
ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard
speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him!" And what is
the answer of the church, but "even so; come, Lord Jesus!" Amen.</p>

<p>"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I Christ."—John xix.
28.</p>
<p>After this, that is, I conceive, (though I do not presume to mark the
very order in which the Lord Jesus uttered his loud cries upon the
cross,) after his complaint of desertion: for whether this was the
fourth or fifth of the seven last words of the Redeemer, I dare not
determine: yet the words themselves were highly important, and
significant of great things, in reference to Jesus and his people. Jesus
thus cried, that the scriptures might be fulfilled, it is said; for it
had been prophesied of him, that gall was given him to eat—and, when
thirsty, vinegar to drink, Ps. lxix. 21. And the soldiers, unconscious
of what they did in fulfilling this very prophecy, gave him sponge
dipped in vinegar. But, my soul, was it the thirst of the body thy Jesus
complained of? I think not. He had before declared, at his last supper,
that he would drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until the day he
drank it new in the kingdom of his Father. What could be then the thirst
of Jesus, but the thirst of his soul, for the accomplishment of
redemption for his people, and the accomplishment of redemption in his
people. He thirsted with an holy vehement thirst for the everlasting
salvation of his ransomed, and seemed to anticipate the hour by this
expression, when he should see the travail of his soul, and be
satisfied. But did not Jesus also, in this hour, as bearing the curse
and wrath of God for sin, thirst in soul with that kind of thirst which,
in hell, those who bear the everlasting torments of condemnation feel,
when they are under an everlasting thirst which admits of no relief!
That representation the Lord Jesus gives of this state, in the parable
of the rich man's thirst, serves to afford a lively but alarming view of
such superlative misery. Oh that those who now add drunkenness to
thirst, would seriously lay this to heart. Did God Suffer his dear Son,
to whom sin was but transferred, and not committed by him—did he suffer
him to cry out under this thirst? and what may we suppose will be the
everlasting cry of such as not only merit his wrath for sin, but merit
yet more his everlasting wrath for refusing redemption by Jesus, who
thirsted on the cross to redeem sinners: from endless thirsting in
despair and misery? My soul, did Jesus thirst for thee? Were his dying
lips parched, and his soul deeply athirst, for thy salvation? And shall
not this thirst of thy Redeemer kindle an holy thirst in thee for him,
and his love and his great salvation? Wilt thou not now this morning
anew, look up by faith to the cross and to the throne, and catch the
flame of love from his holy, loving, longing, and languishing eyes,
until all thy powers go forth in vehement desires, like him of old,
crying out—"As the hart thirsteth for the water brooks, so longeth my
soul after thee, O God. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
for thy love is better than wine."</p>

13—Evening—Acts 2:31</h3>
<p>"His soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
corruption."—Acts ii. 31.</p>
<p>Two sweet, but distinct thoughts, arise out of this scripture: one,
concerns the soul of Christ; the other, respects his body; and both are
most blessed to the believer in the review. My soul! thou hast attended
to the parched state of thy Redeemer, as represented on the cross, and
made it the subject of thy morning meditation; do thou now behold what
this scripture states, under all his humiliating circumstances, that
neither hell nor the grave can have dominion over him. His soul shall
not be long in a way of separation from the body, in the invisible
state; for very shortly it shall arise from hades, the hell here
mentioned. And his body is too holy, harmless, and undefiled, to admit
of putrefaction; yea, it must he presented before the Lord for a
sweet-smelling savour. Precious thought to the believer! Jesus needed
not to lie long under the dominion of death: he had fully paid the debt
of sin by death; and therefore there needed no detention to make farther
restitution for the sins of his people, when thus fully cancelled. And
as the infinite holiness and purity of his nature could not become
subject to the power of corruption, he needed not to lie longer in the
grave than might clearly and fully ascertain to his people in all ages,
the reality of his death, for the better confirmation of the
resurrection that followed. Hence Jesus could not be left, as the great
representative of his people, in a situation so comfortless, when the
work was completed which the Father gave him to do. And as his holy
nature could not admit the possibility of corruption; so the covenant of
redemption exempted him from it. Add to these, it was needful that, both
in soul and body, He who had died for our sins, should rise again for
our justification, and not only triumph in our nature over death, hell,
and the grave, but return to the right hand of power, "there to appear
in the presence of God for us," Hail! thou holy and triumphant Lord! I
bow the knee before thee! In thy holiness thy people are considered
holy: and as thy spotless soul could not be detained in hell, neither
thy flesh see corruption, so all thy redeemed shall be accounted holy
before thee, and through thy righteousness, be considered righteous
before God and thy Father for ever. Amen.</p>

14—Morning—John 19:30</h3>
<p>"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, it is
finished."—John xix. 30.</p>
<p>Perhaps these words formed the sixth cry of the Lord Jesus on the
cross. The glorious close of all his sufferings was now arrived; and
full of these high ideas which occupied his holy mind, he cried out, "It
is finished!" What is finished? Redemption-work is finished. All the
long series of prophecies, visions, types, and the shadows of good
things to come, which pointed to Jesus and redemption by him, were now
finished in their accomplishment. The law was finished in its condemning
power; and the gospel commenced its saving influence. Jesus, by that one
sacrifice now offered, had for ever perfected them that are sanctified.
The separation between Jew and gentile was now finished and done away
for ever. Jesus had now "gathered together, in one, all the children of
God which are scattered abroad." The iron reign of sin and Satan, of
death and hell, were now broken in pieces by this stone cut out of the
mountain without hands; and life and immortality, pardon, mercy, and
peace, were brought to light, and secured to the faithful, by this
finished redemption of the Lord Jesus Christ. The peace, the love, the
favour of God the Father, was now obtained; and that spiritual kingdom
of the Lord Jesus, which shall have no end, was from this moment set up
in the hearts and minds of his people. The sure descent of the Holy
Ghost was now confirmed; and the Lord Jesus already, by anticipation,
beheld his Israel of old, and his gentile church, as well as Ethiopia
and the multitude of the isles, stretching forth their hands unto. God.
Full of these and the like glorious prospects the mind of Jesus was
filled; and having received the vinegar, as the last prophecy remaining
then to be completed, he cried out, "It is finished!" My soul, never let
these precious, precious words of Jesus depart from thy mind. Do by them
as Moses commanded Israel concerning the words he gave them; "let them
be in thy heart, and in thy soul; bind them as a sign upon thine hand,
and let them be as frontlets between thine eyes." Tell thy God and
Father what thy Jesus hath told thee—"It is finished!" He hath finished
redemption for thee; and He will finish redemption in thee. He hath
destroyed death, both satisfied and glorified the law, taken away the
curse, made full restitution for sin, brought in an everlasting
righteousness, and opened the glorious mansions of the blessed as the
home and rest of all his people. Oh my soul, let these dying words of
thy Jesus be made by thee as an answer to all thy prayers, and begin
that song to the Lamb, which ere long, thou wilt fully and loudly sing
among the church above—"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain; for thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood."</p>

14—Evening—Luke 23:35—37</h3>
<p>"And the people stood beholding; and the rulers also with them
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to
him, and offering him vinegar, and saying, if thou be the king of the
Jews, save thyself."—Luke xxiii. 35—37.</p>
<p>My soul! thou art not tired, I hope, of taking thy stand, night by
night, and morning by morning, at the foot of the cross. Surely it is
blessed to sit down by the fountain, which was opened by the soldier's
spear, in the heart of Jesus, and contemplate, one by one, the mercies
which flow in it to the souls of his redeemed. There are more to be
seen, more to be discovered at every renewed review; for in the death of
Christ, is the life of the soul. It is not the smallest part of the
excellencies which Jesus discovered in his death, that it was "the death
of the cross;" for the apostle joins this with his sufferings. He not
only endured the cross, but he despised the shame; and yet that shame,
in all the parts of it, forms a wonderful branch in the subject. My
soul! look at the cross in this point of view, and see whether thou wilt
not draw sweet consolation from it, under the grand consideration, that
as thy sins have caused shame before God, so the shame thy blessed
Surety endured, has more than made satisfaction to the divine glory.
Behold the people, with the rulers, deriding Christ with taunts and
reproaches; and even the Roman soldiers mocking Jesus, though they knew
him not. Indeed, every thing in Christ became the subject of their
resentment. Through his whole life, this had been the case; and now, in
the close of it, the whole is summoned up into the most finished
contempt. His person most daringly despised: "if he be the Son of God,
let God save him if he will have him," say they! His offices blasphemed:
"art thou a king then," said Pilate, in the most sovereign contempt. "If
thou be the King of Israel," said the rabble," save thyself and come
down from the cross." "Prophecy, thou Christ," said one of them in the
hall," who is he that smote thee. "And as a priest, when Jesus was
stretched forth on the cross, as in the act of blessing, and truly in
the act of dying for them, the taunt was, "He saved others, himself he
cannot save." Thus the Lord of life and glory, as the prophet had
foretold, hid not his face from shame and spitting! And, as if to crown
all with the highest possible instance of shame and disgrace, while the
multitude counted him for a deceiver, and all his disciples forsook him
and fled, as from a person with whom it was dangerous to be found, he is
hung up as a malefactor, and that between two thieves; yea, God himself
allowed him, nay, appointed him to be reckoned among the transgressors.
Pause, my soul, over this blissful subject; and most blessed it is, when
Christ is thus beheld in relation to his people. For surely whatever
shame and confusion of face is the sinner's, due by reason of sin, the
Lord Jesus hath fully paid it, yea, more than paid it, as the sinner's
representative. And herein is that scripture completely explained and
applied: "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God. Speak ye
comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is
accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of
the Lord's hand double for all her sins." Surely this was literally and
truly the case in the person of her Almighty Surety and Representative,
when Jesus endured the cross, and bore the shame for all his people!</p>

15—Morning—Luke 23:46</h3>
<p>"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into
thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the
ghost."—Luke xxiii. 46.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, ponder well these last of the last seven
words of thy God and Saviour which he uttered on the cross; for surely
they are most sweet and precious, and highly interesting, both on thy
Saviour's account and thine own. And first remark, the </span><span
class="c6">manner</span><span class="c5"> in which the Lord Jesus thus
breathed out his soul; not like a man spent and exhausted, after hanging
so many hours on the cross, faint with loss of blood, and such agonies
of soul as never one before endured; but it was with a loud voice,
thereby proving what he had before declared—"No man taketh my life from
me; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again."
Precious Jesus, how sweet this assurance to thy people. But wherefore
cry with a loud voice? A whisper, nay, a thought of the soul only, if
with an eye of communication to God the Father, would have been
sufficient, if this had been all that was intended. Wherefore then did
Jesus cry with a loud voice? Was it not that all in heaven, and all in
hell might hear? Did not angels shout at the cry? Did not the spirits of
just men made perfect among the faithful gone to glory in Jesus's name,
hear, and sing aloud? Did not all hell tremble when Jesus thus cried
aloud, conscious that the keys of the grave, and death, and hell, were
now put into his Almighty hand? Oh! precious, precious Jesus! was this
among thy gracious designs for which, when thou wert retiring from the
bloody field of battle, as a conqueror, thy loud voice shouted victory?
And was there not another sweet and gracious design in this loud cry,
Oh! thou blessed Jesus? Didst thou not intend thereby that poor sinners,
unto the ends of the earth, might, by faith, hear and believe to the
salvation of their souls? Didst thou not, dearest Lord! when bowing thy
sacred head, as if to take a parting look of the disciple and the Marys,
at the foot of the cross, and beholding them as the representatives of
all the members of thy mystical body, didst cry with a loud voice, that
all with them might behold thy triumphs, and rejoice in thee their
glorious Head? Yes, Lamb of God! we adore thee in this glorious act; for
we do accept it as it really is, the act of our one glorious head. In
this solemn committing of thy spirit to the Father, we consider our
spirits also as committed with thee, and by thee. (My soul! mark this
down carefully in. the inmost tablet of thine heart.) In all this,
blessed Jesus! thou wert, and art, our Head. Thou didst, to all intents
and purposes, take every individual believer of thine as a part of
thyself, and by this act didst commit, with thyself, the whole into thy
Father's hands, to be kept until the hour of their dropping their
bodies, then to be united to thee for ever. Oh! precious Jesus! O
precious mercy of our Jesus, how safe, how eternally safe, and secure,
are all thy redeemed! Well might thine apostle say, "No man liveth to
himself, and no man dieth to himself; for in Jesus his people ever live,
and in Jesus they securely die." Henceforth, dear Lord! let me know
myself to be already committed with thee, and by thee, into the hands of
my God and Father in Jesus, and when the hour cometh that the casket, in
which that precious jewel, my soul, now dwells, is opened for the soul
to take her departure, O then for faith in lively, active, earnest
faith, to follow the example, and to adopt the very language of my God
and Saviour; and to cry out—"Lord Jesus, into thy hands I commend my
spirit; for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of
truth!"</span></p>

<p>"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after
he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right
hand of God."—Heb. x. 11, 12.</p>
<p>The morning portion was the finishing cry of Jesus on the cross.
This, my soul, I hope thou didst, as it were, hear with the ear of
faith: beholding with the eye of faith, the Lord of life and glory as
retreating from the field of battle, having gotten himself the victory,
and by that "one offering of himself, once offered, for ever perfected
them that are sanctified. "Fold up then the blessed object for thy
nightly pillow, as for thy morning meditation, and bring it forth
continually for thine unceasing joy and peace in believing, that (as the
Holy Ghost hath in this scripture, for thy present enjoyment, sweetly
set it forth) when all the priests in their daily ministry could
accomplish nothing, this man, this God-man, this thy Jesus, whose name
is Wonderful, hath "by his one offering," for ever put away sin, and
is"sat down on the right hand of God;" to see the purchase of his
redemption, by price and by power, fully compensated to all his people.
But here lie the blessed effects of thy Jesus's redemption; and do thou
mark it, and bring it forward constantly in thy pleadings for acceptance
with the Father in the Beloved, that so rich, so precious, so
inestimable and invaluable is the redemption of God's dear Son, that it
never can be fully compensated to his people. A whole eternity will not
be sufficient to pay, nor can all the glories of heaven constitute a
sufficient recompence; for after millions of ages are past, and millions
of redemption blessings have been given in them, such is the infinite
merit, and such is the infinite glory of the Son of God's righteousness,
and blood, and sacrifice, that there must still remain a surplus unpaid,
a redundancy still unaccounted for. Jesus will have brought in such
everlasting revenues of glory to Jehovah, by the redemption of sinners,
and in the honour done to his justice, love, and wisdom, by
accomplishing the work the Father gave him to do, as will never be fully
recompensed; yea, the merit of his cross alone will, to all eternity,
shine with such splendour as to fill heaven with songs of endless
praise. The sons of God, we are told, shouted for joy, when beholding
the six days works of creation. But the six hours which Jesus hung on
the cross wrought a more glorious work of redemption to Jehovah's
praise, and will call up the unceasing adoration of angels and men to
all eternity. What sayest thou, my soul, to this view of the wonderful
subject? Let such be thy meditation day by day, and may thine eyes
prevent the night watches to be fully occupied in it. Take thy stand at
the foot of the cross; there by faith behold Him on whom the eye of
Jehovah is unceasingly fixed: and when thou hast followed the Lamb from
the. cross to the throne, where Jesus is now for ever sat down on the
right hand of God, catch the notes of the hymn which the redeemed are
now singing in glory before him, and in which, ere long, thou wilt
assuredly join: "To him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb
that was slain, be glory and honour for ever and ever. Amen."</p>

<p>"There laid they Jesus."—John xix. 42.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, it is usual for the relations and friends
of those that are deceased to attend the funeral. Art thou a friend, a
relation, of Jesus? Oh yes; I trust thou art. He was, and is, the
dearest of all friends, the nearest of all relations. He is at once all
and every one—the Father, the Husband, the Brother. The invitation is
therefore sent to thee, personally to </span><span
class="c6">thee</span><span class="c5">. Every voice of affection calls
thee to the tomb of Jesus, saying, "Come, see the place where the Lord
lay." And if, like Mary Magdalene, from more abundant love, thou art
asking, "Where have they laid him?"—the answer immediately is returned,
"Come and see." Yes, thou dear Redeemer! by that faith thou hast
graciously given me, I will come and see. Let my faith take wing, and
light down in Joseph of Arimethea's garden, and behold the place where
the Lord lay. Was this the memorable spot? Did Jesus lay here? Did he
here make (according to the ancient prophecy foretold of him)"his grave
with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, because he had done no
violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth? "Here let me look; here
let my soul wander in contemplation. Oh what a marvellous sight to
behold Jesus thus lain in the grave. Surely we may cry out, as the
church did in the view," My beloved is white and ruddy. "Never did death
triumph so before. Never did the grave receive and hold' such a
prisoner. But, my soul, behold also, in the view, how Jesus triumphed
even in death. It was "through death he destroyed him that had the power
of death-that is, the devil, that he might deliver them who, through
fear of death, are all their life-time subject to bondage. "And what
saith Jesus to my soul from the grave? Fear not," I have the keys of
death and the grave: fear not to go down to the Egypt of the grave, I
will go with thee, and will surely bring thee up again from thence. "And
observe, my soul, as the grave could not detain thy Lord, thine Head, a
prisoner; so neither can the grave, beyond the appointed time, detain
any of his members. And as the union between the Godhead and the manhood
in Jesus was not broken off by death, so neither can the union between
Jesus and his people be interrupted by death. The covenant of
redemption, the union of Jesus with his people, the love of God in
Christ to the souls and bodies of his redeemed, all these rot not in the
grave; nay, where sin is taken out, the very enmity of the grave is
slain; and though it acts as a devourer of our corrupt bodies, yet it
acts as a preserver also of the refined part, that the dust and ashes of
his saints Jesus may visit, and manifest his care over, from day to day.
Precious Lord, here then, as in every thing, thou hast the pre-eminence.
Thou hast gone before: thou hast sweetly perfumed the grave by having
lain there. And where should the dying members be but where their living
Head hath been before? Hence then, my soul, take comfort and fear not,
when thy partner, the body, is called upon to go down to the grave. When
the soul flies to Jesus in heaven, the body will sweetly rest in Jesus
till summoned from the grave. Thy God, thy Jesus, hath the appointment
for thy departure; both the place </span><span
class="c6">where</span><span class="c5">, the time </span><span
class="c6">when</span><span class="c5">, and the manner </span><span
class="c6">how</span><span class="c5">, are all with him. He hath the
keys both to open the door of death, and to open the kingdom of heaven.
Leave all then with him. Frequently; by faith, visit his sepulchre, and
behold where they laid him, And in the triumphs of thy Jesus, as thine
head, already take part, as a member of his body, crying out with the
apostle, "Oh death where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?
God be praised who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ."</span></p>

<p>"Having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that
he should be holden of it."—Acts ii. 24.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! thou hast been in contemplation to the
tomb of Jesus this morning, and seen the place where the Lord lay; now
sit down, and ponder over what this blessed scripture saith, that "the
pains of death were loosened, because it was not possible for Jesus to
be detained a prisoner by it. "And if there were no other scripture, but
this one, in proof of Christ's godhead, this in itself would be
unanswerable; for it could be nothing but the godhead of his person
which made it impossible. It was this which, from the union of the
manhood with the godhead, preserved his soul from sin, and his body from
corruption; for though the human nature that Christ took was subject to
all the sinless infirmities of nature, and to feel hunger, weariness,
and the like, to the full, being part of the curse on the fall, which he
came to bear and do away; yet was he not left to the infirmities of what
we, in our fallen state, are exposed to, and often sink under. Sweet
thought, to look. to the tomb of Jesus with! Here, as oft as we
contemplate the spot, we may say: here Christ hath lain down, to teach
his followers to lie down. But here Christ could not be detained; his
holy body was not subject to corruption. "Thou wilt not leave his soul
in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." But
may it not be added also, on another account, that the pains of death
could not hold Christ; forasmuch as God's justice being fully satisfied
by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all, there could
be no detention of the prisoner when the debt was paid? The Lord Jesus
did not, for he needed not, go down to hell for the purpose of receiving
there the punishment our sins deserve, and which, by suffering in our
stead and room, he did away: his sufferings were fully commensurate upon
earth: and it is not the </span><span class="c6">place</span><span
class="c5">, but the </span><span class="c6">degree</span><span
class="c5"> and </span><span class="c6">nature</span><span class="c5">
of punishment, that makes an equivalent on the score of paying. His
capability of suffering, and the extremity of what he endured during his
agony in the garden, and on the cross, (not to mention a whole life of
sorrows, in being all along acquainted with grief) these were the full
Cup of trembling which Jesus drank, and completely adequate it was, or
he would not have said upon the cross, "it is finished!" Neither was it
necessary that the Redeemer should long endure the sufferings due to
sin, as the sinner's surety. Here also his capability of sustaining
much, in a little space, plainly proves, that when all the vials of
divine wrath were poured out upon his sacred head; being once completely
emptied, they could not again be filled. Though had not Jesus died," the
just for the unjust, to bring us to God," the second death (which, out
of Christ, is the sinner's due) must be an eternal death, because the
vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, are only fitted' for, and
capable of receiving misery by portions, which never being fully poured
out, are consequently never finished. But not so with Him who stood the
sinner's surety. He could, and did receive at once, in life and death,
the whole of the punishment due to sin: and therefore he it is of whom
the Holy Ghost speaks, "All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me,"
Psalm xlii. 7. Precious Lord! while I think of these things, and my
whole soul is going forth in sorrow at the contemplation of those
sufferings of thine for' my salvation, grant me to feel at the same time
the blessedness of thy redemption, and my interest in it, since "by thy
stripes I am healed."</span></p>

17—Morning—Luke 24:34</h3>
<p>"The Lord is risen indeed."—Luke xxiv. 34.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Let thy meditations, my soul, this morning, be
sweetly exercised upon thy risen and exalted Saviour. For if thy Lord be
indeed risen, then will it undeniably follow, that as he died for our
sins, so he arose for our justification, and is thereby become the first
fruits 0f them that sleep. Beg of God the Holy Ghost to lead thee into
the devout contemplation and enjoyment of this soul-reviving subject.
Trace the testimonies of this wonderful event, until, frown being
overpowered in the vast assemblage of witnesses, thou art prompted to
cry out in the same language," the Lord is risen indeed. "And surely
never was there any one fact so fully, so dearly, and so
circumstantially confirmed. It hath the united testimony of heaven and
earth: of angels and men, of the living and the dead, of friends and
foes; and God himself confirming it in the midst of his people, by
sending down the Holy Ghost agreeably to the promise of Jesus at the day
of Pentecost. Review these things in order. </span><span
class="c6">First</span><span class="c5">, heaven gave in its evidence in
those supernatural signs which issued in the morning of Jesus's
resurrection; for we are told that "an angel descended from heaven, and
rolled back the stone from the door of Jesus's sepulchre, and sat upon
it." And, </span><span class="c6">secondly</span><span class="c5">,
earth gave her testimony also to the same, by the convulsions sustained
at his approach—"there was a great earthquake. "And then again, as
angels came to inform the pious women who waited to embalm the sacred
body of Christ, that Jesus was risen; so the testimony of multitudes
among men gave equal attestation to this glorious truth. For besides the
many separate and distinct appearances Jesus made to numbers, he
appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, by way of confirming
the undoubted fact. The </span><span class="c6">living</span><span
class="c5">, who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead,
surely could not be mistaken. And the </span><span
class="c6">dead</span><span class="c5"> which arose from their graves,
as if to celebrate the glories of his resurrection, in which they took
part, came forth when the sepulchre yawned at the triumph of Jesus, and
went into the holy city and appeared unto many. And not only the friends
of Jesus, but the foes of Jesus, became undesignedly the witnesses of
this great truth: for, by attributing his resurrection to the disciples
stealing away his body, they positively proved that the body of Christ
remained not in the sepulchre. And that the poor timid disciples whose
meetings were all in secret for fear of the Jews, should project such a
scheme as to take away the body, which the Roman soldiers were purposely
placed to secure, is not to be equaled in folly in the very idea, unless
by that other part of the childish story, that the body was stolen while
the guard slept, that so the testimony, it should seem, to this tale, is
the testimony of men sleeping. Here then, my soul, in devout
contemplation, take thy stand at the door of the sepulchre of thy Jesus,
and ponder over such a multitude of witnesses, who all cry out with one
voice, as the angels did to the astonished women," He is not here; for
he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay." And O
thou dear Redeemer, do thou, while my soul is pondering these things, do
thou draw nigh, as thou didst to the disciples on the morning of thy
resurrection, and sweetly commune with me of all these blessed truths
concerning thyself; lead me, by faith, through all the precious subject,
from the sepulchre to thine house of prayer, to the ordinance and thy
table, from thy cross to thy crown; and cause my whole heart to burn
within me, while thou art talking to me by the way, and while thou art
opening to me the scriptures. Then shall I truly rejoice that my Lord is
indeed risen from the dead, and my soul is risen with him, from dead
works, to serve thee, the living and true God.</span></p>

17—Evening—John 20:19</h3>
<p>"The same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the
doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,
came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto
you."—John xx. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> There is a peculiar blessedness in this first visit
of the Lord Jesus to the whole college of disciples (at least as many as
were present of them) after he arose from the dead: and the manner of
relating it is peculiarly striking also. It was the same day at evening;
and it was the </span><span class="c6">first day</span><span class="c5">
also; as if the Lord Jesus would again and again honour the day, as well
in the evening as the morning of his resurrection, and make that day for
ever memorable to his church, and among his people. My soul! thou hast
celebrated thy Lord's triumphs over death, in the morning, both at home
and abroad, in his church, at his ordinances, at his table, and among
his disciples; but learn hence also, that at evening time Jesus will
make it light by the sweet renewed visits of his grace; and when the
doors are shut, and in thy retirement the world is shut out, and thou
art communing within, Jesus will come and say, "Peace be unto thee." And
doth Jesus do this? Hast thou this precious legacy of peace, which he
left to his people, administered to thee by his own blessed hand? Is he
thy peace, and hath he made thy peace through the blood of his cross?
Having purchased it by his death, doth he confirm it to thee by his
resurrection. and in the earnest of his Spirit, seal it on thy soul to
the day of eternal redemption? Oh! then look up to him, my soul, again
this evening, as thy peace, thy surety, thy sponsor; and say with the
prophet, "This man shall be our peace, when the Assyrian shall come into
our land;" Micah v. 5. Yes, thou dear Redeemer! thou art indeed the
peace, the very means and end of all joy and peace in believing, and
wilt be the everlasting security of thy people in peace with God through
all eternity! Methinks I hear thee say, in the nightly visits of thy
love and grace, as to the disciples of old: "Peace I leave with you; my
peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you: let not
your heart be troubled; neither let it be afraid!"</span></p>

18—Morning—Romans 1:4</h3>
<p>"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."—Romans i. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Do not, my soul, hastily pass away from this most
precious subject of thy Lord's resurrection. It is an inexhaustible
theme, and will be among thy felicities in eternity. Yesterday, thou
didst but barely consider the fact. Let this day occupy thy thoughts on
another sweet portion of it, in beholding how Jesus effected it by his
own power and Godhead. He had said before that he had power to lay down
his life, and power to take it again. And he had told the Jews to
destroy the temple, by which he meant the temple of his body, and be
would raise it again in three days. He had proclaimed himself to be the
resurrection and the life: and here he proved it, when he was declared
to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by
his resurrection frown the dead. Now, then, pause over this glorious
view of Him who was thus proved to be one with the Father, and who, at
the same time, was one ill thy nature, bone of thy bone, and flesh of
thy flesh. Beautiful and comprehensive is the expression—"declared to be
the Son of God!" for who but God could accomplish such an event? And by
the Spirit of holiness he was equally declared to be not liable to
corruption; for, as God's Holy One, it was impossible that his flesh
should see corruption. Psalm xvi. 10. And the Holy Ghost again, by Peter
the apostle, explains it when he saith," Christ was put to death in the
flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. "I Pet. iii. '18. The flesh here
means his human nature; and the quickening by the Spirit (being what is
called the antithesis, that is,. the opposite to flesh) means his own
Spirit, his own power and Godhead; similar to what is said in' the
Hebrews concerning the offering of Jesus, that through the Eternal
Spirit he offered </span><span class="c6">himself</span><span
class="c5">, Heb. ix. 14—meaning, that his Godhead gave dignity and
value to the offering of his body for the sins of his people. Ponder
this blessed truth, my soul; for it is most blessed, and of much greater
importance than, at the first view of the words, it may strike you.
Behold in it, that it was the Godhead of Jesus by which thy Jesus
triumphed over death and the grave. The Father's hand was in it most
certain, as it was in all the other acts of redemption; for the Holy
Ghost taught the church, by Paul, that God. had raised up the Lord. 1
Cor. vi. 14. And manifested by this, saith the Holy Ghost, that he was
the God of peace, in bringing again from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ.
Heb. xiii. 20. And the Holy Ghost had his almighty hand in the same; for
it is the Spirit that quickeneth; and hence Christ is said to have been
justified in the Spirit. I Tim. iii. 16. But while we are taught by
these scriptures, and others to the same purport, to behold both the
Father and the Holy Ghost acting in the resurrection of Jesus—by this,
and others of the same kind, we are taught to view the Godhead in Christ
as the cause of his resurrection. For if Jesus had been raised by the
power of the Father and the Holy Ghost only, how would he have been
declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection? For, in this case,
nothing more would have been manifested in his resurrection than in the
resurrection of others; for it is by the power of God that the dead are
to be raised. Hence, my soul, behold the vast importance of this great
point in the resurrection of thy Lord: and never lose sight of this
blessed truth, that thy Jesus, who is thy resurrection and thy life,
arose himself by this self-quickening principle. Behold, in this point
of view, what a glorious truth is the resurrection of Jesus. And what a
lovely promise did the Lord, by the prophet, give to all the people of
God concerning this, ages before this glorious event took place—"Thy
dead men shall live; together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake
and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs,
and the earth shall cast out her dead. "Isaiah xxvi. 19.</span></p>

18—Evening—Acts 25:19</h3>
<p>"Of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."—Acts
xxv. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> And well might Paul affirm it; for Jesus, after his
resurrection, had spoken to Paul from heaven! Well might John, the
beloved apostle, give the church his repeated evidence to it; for Jesus
not only made his appearance to John, in common with the other apostles,
but in the island of Patmos appeared to him alone, and proclaimed
himself under those glorious distinctions of character: "Fear not; I am
he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore!" Rev.
i. 17, 18. And well might Peter testify to the same, as he did in the
family of Cornelius, when he had such indisputable proofs for himself
and the rest of his brethren, the apostles, who were "the chosen
witnesses of his resurrection: we did eat and drink with him (saith
Peter) after he arose from. the dead;" Acts x. 41. But, my soul! mark,
in the contempt with which this blessed truth is spoken of, by the Roman
governor, how little esteemed, and less regarded by the world, is that
doctrine, which is thy life. And are there not thousands in the present
hour, like Festus, who, even if they do profess a belief of Jesus's
resurrection, are like him, unconscious of its vital effects on their
hearts; and as to any of the saving influences resulting from it in the
descent of the Spirit upon them, have "never so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost!" My soul! how wilt thou prove the resurrection
of Jesus in thine own experience, that, like Paul, thou mayest with
equal confidence speak of this </span><span class="c6">One
Jesus</span><span class="c5">, this only One, this blessed One, who was
truly and indeed dead, but whom thou affirmest to be alive? Pause over
the question, and then look into the real testimonies of it in thine
heart. Remember what thy Jesus said as a promise which should take place
soon after his resurrection and return to his Father, when
redemption-work was finished: "I will send the Holy Ghost the Comforter.
He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you; "John xiv. 26. Hence therefore, if the
Holy Ghost is come, then is Jesus risen and ascended; and then hath the
Father also most fully confirmed his perfect approbation of the
righteousness and death of Jesus, as the Surety of his people, in
raising him from the dead, setting him on his own right hand, and
sending down the Holy Ghost, agreeably to Christ's promise. And dost
thou know all these things, in thine own experience? Is Jesus thy
resurrection and life? Hath he recovered thee by the quickening,
influences of his Holy Spirit, from death to life, and from the power of
sin and Satan to the living God? Is he now the daily life-giving,
life-imparting, life-strengthening source of all thy faith, and life,
and hope, and joy? Is it Jesus that becomes to thee as the dew unto
Israel, reviving, like the dew of herbs, thy dry and unpromising wintry
state, where there is no vegetation, and causing thee to put forth the
tender bud afresh, when, without his influence, every thing in thee was
parched and withered? Oh! then do thou proclaim it far and near, and let
every one witness for thee, in every circle in which thou art called to
move, that that one glorious Jesus, which was once dead, thou affirmest
to be alive, and liveth for evermore. Precious Lord Jesus! how blessed
are those sweet words of thine to my soul: "And because I live, ye shall
live also!"</span></p>

19—Morning—Romans 4:25</h3>
<p>"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
ourjustification."—Romans iv. 25.</p>
<p>My soul, thou must not yet dismiss—no, nor ever dismiss, the sweet
and precious subject of thy Lord's resurrection. One part of it thou
hast not yet scarce glanced at; and yet it is such a one as thine
everlasting safety, and thy justification before God depends upon.
"For," as the Holy Ghost hath said, by the mouth of his servant the
apostle," if Christ be not risen, then are believers yet in their sins.
"1 Cor. xv. 17. See to it then, my soul, that what this sweet scripture
of the morning saith be true, that Jesus was delivered for thine
offences, and was raised again for thy justification. While Jesus was on
the cross, and when Jesus was taken down and laid in the grave, the
payment and the ransom for sin was then discharging. Jesus was then
truly delivered for our offences. And when he arose from the dead, then
the poor sinner, for whom he was delivered, and for whom he died, was
truly justified before God; for thereby proof was made that the debt was
paid, the receipt given, and God, in confirmation of it, styled himself
by a new name, even the God of Peace, in bringing again from the dead
our Lord Jesus Christ, as the great Shepherd of his sheep, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant. Hence the resurrection of Jesus was
like going into the presence of God to cancel the bond, the hand-writing
of ordinances, that was against us. It was as if Jesus gave this
testimony in his glorious resurrection, that both sin and death had now
lost their retaining power; the dominion of both were for ever done
away, and all true believers in Christ might join the apostle's
song—"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God
that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
also maketh intercession for us. "My soul, be sure to keep this in
constant view, when, at any time, thou art meditating on the death and
resurrection of Jesus: and let both be thy daily meditation. Think how
truly blessed, how truly happy, how present and everlastingly secure,
must those souls be who are interested in the death and in the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus. By the one he hath purchased their
pardon, and by the other he hath justified their persons; so that, when
law and justice present their charge against them, this is the
unanswerable plea—Jesus "was delivered for our offences, and raised
again for our justification. "Oh dearest Lord, grant me daily and hourly
to be bringing into all my spiritual enjoyments the sweet sense and
consciousness of being thus interested, justified, and se, cared. Give
me a present right and title, that I may live upon it; and by and by,
when thou shalt call me home,, then, Oh Lord, present me finally and
fully, once for all, as made comely in thy comeliness, clothed in thy
righteousness, and fully prepared, both in soul and body, for
everlasting happiness and glory among them that are sanctified.</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span

19—Evening—Isaiah 26:19</h3>
<p>"Thy dead men shall live; together with my dead body shall they
arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew
of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."—Isaiah xxvi. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Thy morning meditation was a blessed portion, to
shew thee, my soul, how the justification of the believer is effected by
the person of his glorious Head. When Jesus died on the cross, not as a
private person, but as the public head of his church, then he paid the
full debt of sin: and when he arose from the dead, the full release was
given to our whole nature in him. Jesus received the discharge; the bond
he had entered into for his people was cancelled, and his resurrection
became the proof of their's also. But as the justification of all the
persons of his redeemed is </span><span class="c6">in</span><span
class="c5"> Him, and </span><span class="c6">by</span><span class="c5">
Him, so another sweet confidence is in Him also: Jesus is not only the
cause of their being </span><span class="c6">justified</span><span
class="c5">, but of their being </span><span
class="c6">glorified</span><span class="c5"> also. In these precious
words we have, first, God the Father's promise to his dear Son: "Thy
dead men shall live:" first in grace, and then in glory. How shall this
be effected? Christ then takes up the subject in answer; "Together with
my dead body (saith he) shall they arise: "or it is possible the words
may be still the words of the Father; for the body of Christ is said to
be given of the Father: "A body hast thou prepared me," Heb. x. 15. But
in either sense, the doctrine is the same; the resurrection of the
believer is assured from its union with Christ. Jesus is the head of his
body, the church. "Your life (saith the apostle) is hid with Christ in
God Col. iii. 3. And so again: "If the Spirit of him that raised up
Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Christ from the
dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth
in you;" Rom. viii. 11. Lastly, to crown all, as Jesus is the whole
cause, both in </span><span class="c6">justifying</span><span
class="c5">, and in </span><span class="c6">glorifying</span><span
class="c5">, so is he the </span><span class="c6">pattern</span><span
class="c5">, in his resurrection, </span><span
class="c6">how</span><span class="c5"> they shall arise. As the dew of
herbs casteth out the same from the earth every year, so shall the earth
cast out her dead. Christ's body was in substance the same, and so must
be his. people. "This corruptible (saith the apostle) this very
identical body, must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality." Not "another body;" for then it would be "another person;
"and this, instead of a </span><span class="c6">resurrection</span><span
class="c5">, would be a </span><span class="c6">creation</span><span
class="c5">. But the identical person that was buried, shall arise with
the same identity. Well might the prophet, when giving this blessed
promise, at the command of Jehovah, close it with that delightful
injunction: "Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust. "And what a song to
God and the Lamb will burst forth at once from millions of the redeemed,
when rising to all the wonders of futurity, in, and </span><span
class="c6">through</span><span class="c5">, and </span><span

Corinthians 15:20</h3>
<p>"Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of
them that slept."—I Cor. xv. 20.</p>
<p>One view more, my soul, while thou art meditating upon this
delightful subject of thy Redeemer's triumph over death and the grave,
and now look at Jesus's resurrection as a sure pledge and confirmation
of thine own. Did Jesus's holy body arise? Then so shall thine, sinful
and polluted as it now is, but then made a glorified body by virtue of
thy union with him. For so saith the Holy Ghost, by his servant the
apostle "He shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
unto his glorious body. For if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus
from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead,
shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in
you. "Phil. iii. 21. Rom. viii. 11. Pause then, my soul, and rejoice in
this glorious and transporting doctrine. As sure as Jesus arose, so sure
shall all his people; for Jesus arose as the first fruits. Jesus arose
not as a private person, but as the public Head. Never call to mind the
resurrection of Jesus, but be sure to connect always with it this
blessed view of the subject—every redeemed believer is part of Christ's
body. And as we are by nature part of the first Adam, and die, from our
union and connection, and being of the same nature with him; so, by
grace, being part of Christ's mystical body, who is called in scripture,
particularly on this account, the second Adam, his people are interested
ip all that concerns him; and because he liveth, they must live also.
Hence he is called the first fruits, the first-born from the dead. And
as all the after fruits of the harvest follow the first fruits; so the
saints, born again in God, follow the first-born from the dead to glory.
Oh heart reviving subject! The eyes that now read these lines, and the
hand that now writes them, is a part of Christ's mystical body by
regeneration, must assuredly be a part in the resurrection. In the eye
of the law they are one. Jesus is the head of his body the church: and
how incomplete in glory would be that glorious head without the whole
and every individual member of his fair one, his spouse, which he hath
betrothed to himself for ever. Shout then, my soul, and shout aloud, and
say with Job—"Though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
flesh shall I see God. "My flesh shall moulder indeed, in the dust, and
see corruption. And so would I have it to be. Vile' and polluted as it
now is, and fighting as it. now doth against my soul's desires and
affections, methinks I would not, if it were possible, take it with me
to heaven as it now is. But when Jesus shall change this vile body, and
have fashioned it like unto his glorious body, then it will be without
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and then soul and body, united
together in love, and both united to the Lord, will form one united
object to praise and glorify God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to all
eternity! My soul, dwell upon these things; give thyself wholly to them;
and as thou believest that Jesus died and rose again, so equally believe
also, that all they that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For
this the apostle had in commission from the Lord to tell all true
believers, that when Jesus shall "descend from heaven, with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, the dead in
Christ shall arise; and then they which remain unto the coming of the
Lord, shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air,
and so shall they ever be with the Lord. "Oh for grace to comfort one
another with these words!</p>

20—Evening—Job 15:12-13</h3>
<p>"So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they
shall, not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. O that thou wouldest
hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me in secret, until thy
wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me!
"—Job xvi. 12, 13.</p>
<p><span class="c5">My soul! thou hast been viewing and reviewing some
of the blessed things, connected with the glorious doctrine of thy
Redeemer's resurrection, for several nights and mornings past; but there
is one more point of view in which that heavenly truth demands
attention, and which thou hast not even glanced at. Sit down, and ponder
over the joy, the gratulations, the unspeakable rapture which will
result from the meeting of thyself! I mean thou and thy body meeting
together after the long separation made by the grave, and all the
humbling circumstances of this flesh of thine having seen corruption.
Figure to thyself what an interview that will be of soul and body! In
this life, my soul may truly say to the body, Oh! how exceedingly
burdened am I, day by day, from an union too dear to be parted from but
with pain; and yet too opposed, in all my pursuits and desires, to what
I am longing after in spiritual attainments, to wish always to continue!
I know, that whilst I am now at home in the body, I am absent from the
Lord; and still so much am I allied to thee, so dear art thou, that when
the prospect of separation appears, though I know it is but for a
season, nature shrinks back, and recoils with terror!—There must be the
clammy sweat of death, and, whatever it be, or in whatever it consist,
there must be a separation of soul and body. Therefore, like the
apostle," though in this tabernacle I groan, being burthened," yet it is
"not to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
swallowed up of life. "Pause, my soul, and receive comfort from the
divine portion of the evening. Job comforted himself with it, and why
should not you? Though death separate soul and body, yet it is only to
devour that corrupt part of the body which is now so afflictive to the
soul. The Lord will "appoint a set time and remember." "He will call,
and thou shalt answer him. He will have a desire to the work of his
hands. "Moreover, thy body, corrupt as it now is, and virtually all sin,
yet hath Jesus as much made it his purchase as the soul. And when the
set time arrives, by virtue of his resurrection, thy body shall arise,
and thou shalt be among the first, when Jesus gives the word, to
descend, and meet thyself in the body, then no longer disposed to
interrupt thy purer joys, but as much alive as thou art to the
everlasting service, love, and praise of God and the Lamb. Hail, thou
glorious Restorer of all things! In thy light shall I see light: and
"when thou, who art my life, shall appear, then shall I appear with thee
in glory. "Amen.</span></p>

<p>"The glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be
one, even as we are one. "—John xvii. 22.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Those are sweet views of Jesus which point to our
oneness and union with him, by which alone we derive an interest in him,
and are made partakers both in his grace and glory. By virtue of this it
is, that the glory the Father gave Jesus, as Mediator, all his people
are interested in, and truly enjoy. For though like the heir of a
kingdom, when an infant, the babe is unconscious of his dignity, yet is
not the less entitled to his high birth and rank: so the seed of Jesus,
while in this childhood of existence, though they do not live up to
their high privileges through the weakness of their faith, yet their
claim in Jesus is not the less. Jesus hath given them the glory of being
brought within the covenant, the glory of redemption, the glory of the
Holy Ghost's gifts and influences; and, in short, all the glory which a
state of grace implies, and which is the earnest of the future fulness
of glory. And, my soul, dost thou ever pause over this account of
present glory as if thou didst not truly know thine interest and the
enjoyment of it? Look at it only under these two considerations, and
then bow down under a sense of it in the dust before God. In the first,
put forth thy utmost faculties to calculate that glory which, if thou
art one of Jesus's redeemed people, thou now truly hast in having union
with Christ! Who shall undertake to describe that glory imparted to a
poor worm of the earth, who is brought into union with God's dear Son?
Paul speaks of it as an high privilege, when he said, , Ye are come to
an innumerable company of angels. "But what is the society of angels,
compared to an union with Jesus? Moreover, angels have no such
privilege: for while Jesus is to them their Lord and Sovereign, and
governs them by his supreme command, yet is he not to them as he is to
his church, the glorious head of that church, which is his body, and by
which he perpetually communicates to all his members a source of
gracious and glorious influences, according to what he hath said,"
Because I live, ye shall live also. "Hence, what the Redeemer said to
the Father is explained on this sure testimony—"The glory thou gavest me
I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one. "Look at the
subject under </span><span class="c6">another</span><span class="c5">
consideration. Hath not Jesus given present glory to all his redeemed in
that communication which is perpetually passing and repassing between
him and them by virtue of this oneness, and unity, and interest, into
which they are actually brought? My soul, what sayeth thy experience to
this precious truth? Dost thou really and truly partake of what is
Jesus's; and doth he not really and truly partake of what is thine? Is
there not an exchange, a barter, a fellowship, carried on between thy
glorious head and thyself? Surely thou hast communion in whatever
belongs to Christ as Mediator; in his righteousness, in his grace, his
redemption, his glory. And doth not Jesus manifest continual tokens that
he takes part in all that concerns thee; thy sorrows, thy wants, thine
afflictions? Was it not said of him, ages before his incarnation, when
speaking of his people," in all their affliction he was afflicted? "And
is it not said now, that "whosoever toucheth his people toucheth the
apple of his eye? "Oh unparalleled grace! 0 matchless love, that the Son
of God should thus manifest his affection! What will you call this, my
soul, but what thy God and Saviour hath called it—the glory which the
Father gave him, he hath given to his people. And all this on purpose to
prove that they are one with him. Hallelujah!</span></p>

21—Evening—John 12:24</h3>
<p>"Verily, verily I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit."—John xii. 24.</p>
<p>How sweet and lovely is this similitude of the Lord's, in allusion to
himself! See to it, my soul, this evening, that thou art able to receive
it. Thou hast been attending thy Lord to the tomb: here behold the
blessed fruits of his precious death. When Jesus became incarnate, like
a pure corn of the finest wheat, he fell to the ground; and when at his
death," he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
death," he fell into the ground: and now what an abundant harvest of
glory to God, and salvation to souls, hath that death, and grave of
Jesus produced! Had Jesus never died, how would he have seen his seed,
and the pleasure of the Lord prosper in his hand? Had Jesus not
descended to the grave, how would he have been the life-giving, the
soul-quickening root of all his church and people? But now, by this one
precious corn of wheat falling into the ground, and dying, how hath the
garner of God been filled, and is now continually filling, with his
seed! Precious Jesus! give me to see that I am thy seed, in the ever
green and flourishing verdure of my soul from thy quickening influence!
And let that promise of my covenant Father and God in Christ be my daily
portion: "As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: my
spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put into thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and
for ever."</p>

22—Morning—Matthew 24:28</h3>
<p>"Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
together. "—Matt, xxiv. 28.</p>
<p>My soul! these are the words of Jesus, none of which should be
suffered to fall to the ground. No doubt much instruction is contained
in this passage. An eagle is a bird of prey: and Job saith, that the
eagle hasteneth to the prey as the swift ships. Job ix. 26. In all birds
of prey there is great sagacity, a vast quickness of scent to smell
their proper food afar off; and thus natural instinct, added to a
rapacious appetite, compel those creatures to fly swift to their prey,
and to devour the carcase. Is there nothing in all this that suits thee,
my soul? Oh yes: If Jesus hath given thee a real principle of life in
himself, which becomes a spiritual quickening from day to day, and from
one hour to another, thy hungering and thirsting for Jesus will be as
earnest and as importunate as the instinct of nature in those birds for
daily food. Pause, my soul, and say—is it so? Dost thou seek after Jesus
in his ordinances, in his word, in retirement, in meditation, in prayer,
in providences; and, in short, in all the various ways by which thou
mayest enjoy him, as a famished bird would hasten to his prey? If Jesus
be indeed the one blessed object of thy desire, will not this be
manifested by the earnestness of thy desires? Did David long for the
waters of Bethlehem when thirsty? Did he declare," that as the hart
panteth for the waterbrooks," so he longed for the enjoyment of God?
Here then, my soul, mayest thou learn how to estimate the real standard
of thy affections to thy Jesus. Oh for grace to have the soul exercised
day and night, and never, never to give over those longings, like
pregnant women, until the full desires of the soul in Jesus, and upon
Jesus, be fully gratified. Methinks as the eagles gather together unto
the carcase, so should believers be found feasting upon Jesus. In Jesus,
and his glorious excellencies, every thing is suited to the wants of the
believer: his name, his person, his work, his blood, his righteousness;
every perfection, every promise, every experience we have had in him in
times past, becomes food to the soul. So that the spiritual cravings of
the soul, when the soul is in health and strength, like the natural
cravings of the bird of prey, act like the same instinct to lead to and
to feed upon Jesus. See then, my soul, whether this morning thou art
risen with a keen appetite for Jesus. Surely thou hast tasted that the
Lord is gracious in times past. And if thou art in health of soul, wilt
thou not as much hunger again for this heavenly food, as the body of an
healthy man craves for his morning meal? Oh blessed Lord, give me this
appetite. Excite an hungering in me for thee. Let it be for thyself; not
for thy gifts only, not for thy graces only, sweet as these are; but,
blessed Jesus, let it be for thyself. And let this desire be continual:
every day, and all the day. And let it be wholly to thee, in all that
belongs to thee. I mean, after every thing in Jesus; thy cross, if
needful, as well as thy crown; a love to thy precepts, as well as thy
promises. And, O let this desire be so insatiable, so earnest, so
unceasing, that nothing I have of thee may so satisfy me that I should
long no more after thee; but rather provoke my soul's appetite, and tend
but to inflame my heart and longings more and more, till, from tasting
of thee here below, thou bringest me to the fountain-head of enjoyment
above, where my longing eyes and longing soul shall feast upon Jesus and
his love for ever and for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>"He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
walking in his uprightness "</p>
<p><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c6">—Isaiah lvii, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="c5">Here, my soul, is a sweet portion for thee to lie
down with, this night, and every night until the night of death arrives,
and thou droppest asleep in the arms of Jesus, to wake no more, till the
everlasting morn arise that shall have no night. This is the privilege
of the faithful, who enter into the peace of Jesus, and these are the
beds they repose in, yea, each of them, for it is the personal enjoyment
of each, and of all, to make Jesus their rest. "This is the rest (saith
the Holy Ghost, by this same prophet, chap. xxviii. 12.) wherewith ye
may cause the weary to rest, and this is the refreshing. "And dost thou
know it, my soul, that Jesus is all this for thee to rest upon, for
peace here, and glory to all eternity? Behold him in his person; behold
him in the fulness of his grace, his righteousness, his blood, and the
unceasing efficacy of his atonement and salvation! Surely thou hast both
known him, and rested upon him, under all these endearing views, and
therefore cannot now need to inquire, what is the rest of the weary, and
the sure dwelling-place of the believer? Look at each sweet character
and office of Jesus, and mark how suited they all are for his people,
when buffetted by Satan, or fatigued in the world, or tired with the
many burdens and interruptions to their peace, which arise from bodily
infirmities; look at each, and see what a bosom Jesus opens to receive,
and lull to sleep in his arms, every lamb of his fold. If the tempter
should hiss from the "lion's den, and from the mountain of the leopards,
how quieting is that voice which speaketh pardon and peace in the blood
of the cross! And what strength does faith afford in Jesus's
righteousness," to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked! "If the
world frown, if family cares and sorrows arise, or if any of those
various afflictions which necessarily arise out of a fallen state,
abound to make this state wearisome, still the promise holds good: "he
shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beds:" Jesus will here
again lull them to sleep with his sweet refreshments. "In the world ye
shall have tribulation, but in me ye shall have peace. "And if, my soul,
thine own manifold frailties, which daily and hourly harass thee, from
that body of sin and death thou carriest about with thee; if these
induce sorrow, as well they may, Oh! how blessed is it to look up to
Jesus under all, and view that blood which speaketh for thee, more than
all thy errors plead against thee! Here, thou dearest Lord, wilt thou
cause me to find constant support and consolation in thee; and, amidst
all, I shall hear thy lovely voice saying," Come unto me, all ye that
are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. "Lie down then, my
soul, this night, and every night, until thou takest thy last night in
the quiet bosom of the grave, upon the covenant promises of thy God, in
the sure and safe resting-place of thy Jesus, and his finished
salvation. And as the waters of the flood allowed no resting-place for
the dove, neither could she find place for the sole of her foot, until
she returned to Noah in the ark, so neither will the tribulated waters
of sin, and sorrow, and temptation, suffer thee to enjoy rest in any
thing short of Jesus, which the ark of Noah signified. "Return then to
thy rest, O my soul, return to thy Jesus, thy Noah, thine ark, for the
Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee? "</span></p>

<p>"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living. "—Rom. xiv. 9.</p>
<p>And was this the cause, dearest Jesus, of all thy sufferings, that
thou mightest be the universal monarch on thine eternal throne? Then
bend thy knee, my heart, and all the affections of my soul, and hail thy
Jesus Lord of all! Now, Lord, I see through thy blessed teaching, though
a fool, and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets have
spoken—now I see how expedient it was that Christ should suffer, and
should enter into his glory. Yes, thou art, indeed, Lord both of dead
and living; the dead to raise, even the dead in trespasses and sins; and
the living to live in them, and rule, and guide them. And as thou art
Lord both of dead and living, so, precious Jesus, wilt thou be Lord over
all the dead and lifeless affections of thy redeemed. Surely, Lord
Jesus, my soul may well believe this; for if, when upon the cross, thou
didst conquer death, now thou art upon the throne, every power must be
put beneath thy feet. Shout then, my soul, .shout all ye followers of
the Lord; never more let dead frames, or dying affections, or unbelief,
or all the temptations of Satan, cast us down. Is not Christ upon the
throne? And is he not Lord both of dead and living? And hath not this
Almighty Lord, both of dead and living, power to save, power to quicken
dead sinners, and comfort living saints; to give grace to the weak; and
to them that have no might, to increase strength? Hath he not power to
kindle anew his own graces that he first planted; to bring back again
wanderers, to reclaim the long-lost backsliders, to soften hard hearts,
to bind up broken hearts, to justify the guilty, to sanctify the filthy,
to adopt orphans, to bless the fatherless, to be gracious, and kind, and
merciful—in a word, to be Jesus? For in that one word is summoned up
all. Oh blessed Master! Oh for an heart to love thee, to live to thee,
to walk with thee, to rejoice in thee, to be always eyeing thee on thy
throne; and never, never to lose sight of thee, my glorious, risen, and
exalted Saviour, in this sweet and endearing point of view, in which thy
servant the apostle hath here represented thee; that it was for this
end, as well as a thousand other blessed purposes, that Christ both
died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of dead and
living. Hallelujah. Amen.</p>

23—Evening—Ecclesiastes 10:19</h3>
<p>"A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all things"—Eccles. X. 19.</p>
<p><span class="c5">What feast is this, which the wise man meant, and
the wine which, for true mirth, he would here recommend? He could not
mean the laughter of the fool for that, he tells us elsewhere (chap.
vii. 6.) </span><span class="c6">"is as the crackling of thorns under a
pot."</span><span class="c5"> The drunkard's song is but the mirth of
the moment, which, like the burning thorn, may blaze and flash amidst
the midnight crew, but suddenly goeth out, and leaves a total darkness.
But if Solomon had an eye to the feast which Jesus hath made in the
mountain of the Lord's house </span><span class="c6">"a feast of fat
things,"</span><span class="c5"> where his body broken, and his blood
shed, are the food of the table; this indeed is a feast made for real
joy of heart, and </span><span class="c6">"wine which cheereth God and
man;"</span><span class="c5"> Judges ix. 13. When the justice of God
drank of this blood of the Lamb, it was satisfied; and when the poor
sinner hath tasted of it, his soul is satisfied also. And as
</span><span class="c6">"money answereth all things,"</span><span
class="c5"> because all things are procurable by it, so the redemption
of Jesus answereth all the wants of a sinner. He is meat to the hungry
soul, and drink to the thirsty. He is a garment to the naked, and the
medicine of life to the diseased. </span><span class="c6">" I will cause
them (saith Jesus) that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill
their treasures."</span><span class="c5"> Sit down, my soul, this
evening, and mark the striking contrast. The pleasures of the carnal are
short and unsatisfying; yea, they have nothing more in the enjoyment of
them than what is common to the brute that perisheth, and the after
effects are all on the side of sorrow. The word of God hath described it
in a finished form of misery: </span><span class="c6">"though wickedness
be sweet in his mouth; though he hide it under his tongue, though he
spare it, and forsake it not, but keep it still within his mouth; yet
his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within
him,"</span><span class="c5"> Job xx. 12, 13, 14. What an awful
termination to a life of sensuality and carnal pursuits. Sin and folly
lead in the front, and misery and sorrow bring up the rear! But in the
sweet feast of Jesus, all is joy and peace in the Holy Ghost; and the
believer sits down, as under the everlasting smiles of God, hearing and
embracing the blessed invitation: </span><span class="c6">"I have
gathered my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my honeycomb with my
honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea,
drink abundantly, O beloved!"</span><span class="c5"> Blessed Lord! Be
it my portion, thus, night by night, and day by day, to hear thy voice,
to behold thy countenance! And do thou Lord, come in and sup with me,
and cause me to sup with thee, until thou take me home to thine eternal
feast above, whence I shall rise no more; where one everlasting banquet
will remain, and the redeemed of the Lord will live for ever
</span><span class="c6">"in the presence of God and the
Lamb!"</span></p>

<p><span class="c5">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken
up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their
king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of
them."—</span><span class="c6">Micah ii. 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="c5">Pause, my soul, over this precious scripture, and
ask thine own heart who this Almighty Breaker can be, except the Lord
Jesus Christ; for he, and he alone, answers to such a divine character.
Was it not he which came up as the Breaker from everlasting; when, in
the council of peace, the divine decree was broken open, and the Son of
God stood forth the sinner's Surety? Was it not he whom John saw by
vision, who alone was found worthy in heaven to open the book, and loose
the seals thereof? Was it not the same precious Holy One, who, when in
the volume of the book it was found written of him, that he should
fulfil the law of Jehovah for sinful man, cried out," Lo, I come? And
was it not Jesus, even thy Jesus, my soul, that in the fulness of time
came up as the Breaker, to break down the dreadful bar of separation
which sin had made between God and man, and to open a new and living way
for the sinner to God by his blood? And when he had broken down the
fence sin had made in disobedience to the divine law, the accusations of
Satan, the dominion of death and the grave, by sustaining the whole
weight and burden of all in his own precious person; did he not, as the
Almighty Breaker; burst asunder the bars of death, and prove himself
thereby indeed to be this Almighty Breaker in such a palpable evidence,
that it was impossible his holy soul could beholden by it? And hath he
not broken through all intervening obstacles, ascended up on high, led
captivity captive, entered into glory, and there ever liveth and
appeareth in the presence of God for us? Is not Jesus then this Almighty
Breaker? But, my soul, look yet further. It is said also, in this
blessed scripture, that the Breaker is not only come up before them,
(that is, his people,) but that "they have broken up, and have passed
through the gate, and are gone out by it; and their king shall pass
before them, and the Lord on the head of them. "And so they are, if so
be this Almighty Breaker hath broken down the strong holds of sin and
Satan in which they lay bound; broken down the natural hatred and enmity
of their own heart against God and his Christ in which they were born,
and in which they lived, and must have died, but for his sovereign grace
manifested in them and towards them; burst open the prison doors of
Satan, and broke off his cursed chains, and brought them out! If these
things are wrought and accomplished in the people, may they not be said,
in his strength, to have broken up, and have passed through the gate of
Satan's dominions, and are gone oust by it into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God? Is it so, my soul, in thy experience? Dost thou indeed
know Jesus for thy Almighty Breaker, by such sweet and precious tokens
of his love and power? Hath thy King passed thus before thee, and thy
Lord on the head of thee? Oh then, be ever on the look out for all the
renewed visits of his grace, in which he still acts as thine Almighty
Breaker, in breaking down all the remaining obstacles which thy
unbelief, and fears, and doubts, are continually raising up against thy
own happiness, in his precious manifestations. Look up to him daily,
hourly, minutely, if possible, that he may break down all the remains of
indwelling corruption in thy nature, by which these fears and this
unbelief gets hold fast in thy soul; and be often on the look out also
for that glorious day of God, when this Almighty Breaker shall finally
and fully come, and break through the clouds to judgment, to break down
every remaining evil that keep thee now from the everlasting enjoyment
of thy Lord. Hasten, blessed Jesus! come, my beloved, and, with a glory
infinitely surpassing all conception, manifest thyself as the Almighty
Breaker, in this full display of thy sovereignty and power. And then, as
Samson (the type in this instance) carried with him the gates of his
prison, so wilt thou break up and carry away all the gates of thy
people's graves, and take all thy redeemed home with thee to glory, that
where thou art, there they shah be also. Hail, thou Almighty Breaker!
Jesus omnipotent, reigneth!</span></p>

<p>"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have
need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,
and poor, and blind, and naked; I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou
mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see."—Rev. iii.
17, 18.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! take a leisurely view of what the Redeemer
hath here stated of the church of Laodicea, and gather from it thine
evening improvement. What a melancholy representation hath Jesus given!
It would have been bad enough to have been in this state, even had the
church been seeking deliverance from it; but to fancy herself well when
very ill, to have the spots of death upon her when she supposed herself
recovered, what can be more awful? See to it, my soul, that this be not
thy case; ponder over the several characters here drawn, and mark well,
whether, through grace, thou hast happily been better taught? Dost thou
fancy thyself "rich, and increased in goods, and having need of nothing?
"Alas! thou knowest that thou art as poor as ever the circumstances of
original sin and actual transgression could make a sinner; from thy
first father, Adam, thou hast derived a nature which is virtually all
sin, and that sin is continually breaking out, to manifest that all
thine affections and thy desires cleave to the earth, and are altogether
earthly. So that, so far from needing nothing, thou art insolvent before
God, and in want of every thing. Hence thou knowest thy wretchedness and
poverty by nature and by practice: for without a view of Christ, and
void of an interest in him, thou art so </span><span
class="c6">wretched</span><span class="c5">, as to be lost for ever; so
</span><span class="c6">blind</span><span class="c5">, that thou
wouldest not have had even a knowledge of thy miserable state; and so
</span><span class="c6">naked</span><span class="c5">, that thou
wouldest not have sought the covering of Jesus's robe of salvation, to
conceal thy shame, either in this world, or in that which is to come.
And hath the Lord taught thee these precious truths? Art thou more and
more sensible of the utterly lost state of every man by nature? And
after all that thou hast attained in thy pursuit of the divine truths,
hast thou arrived at the same conclusion as the apostle," that thou
knowest nothing yet as thou oughtest to know? "Oh! then listen to the
gracious advice of Jesus, and accept the counsel of that Wonderful
Counsellor; buy of him all he recommends, for </span><span
class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> him, and </span><span
class="c6">with</span><span class="c5"> him, are deposited all graces.
"In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. He hath
</span><span class="c6">gold</span><span class="c5">, yea," gold tried
in the fire;" all grace, mercy, pardon, strength, faith, hope, love,
holiness; yea, every thing that can make a poor sinner rich. And he hath
</span><span class="c6">white raiment</span><span class="c5"> to cover
thee, even the spotless robe of his own righteousness, which will not
only conceal the shame of thy nakedness, but when he hath washed thee
from all thy pollutions in his blood, will make thee appear comely in
his comeliness, that thou mayest appear before God and the Father
justified and complete in his salvation. And he hath the </span><span

the spiritually blind, which will effectually, under the anointing of
the Holy Ghost, give thee to see thy nothingness, and the glory,
fulness, and suitableness of Jesus! What sayest thou, my soul, to these
things? Wilt thou not accept the counsel of thy Jesus? Yea, Lord, I do
accept it, on my bended knees, with thanksgiving, love, and praise. And
more especially, dear Lord, do I bless thee for thy bounty, that the
purchase of these mercies from thee comes from thy free grace, not from
my ability; Jesus never proposed to the poor to merit what he freely
</span><span class="c6">gives</span><span class="c5">; nor to the
insolvent, who have nothing to offer, to suspend his riches upon their
merits. Thou, Lord, art too rich to need any thing from thy creatures;
and the things proposed are too costly to be purchased; yea, Lord, thou
hast thyself already bought them with a price no less dear than thine
own most precious blood. Hence, therefore, thou wise, gracious, kind,
and compassionate Lord, I pray for grace to accept thy counsel, and to
buy of thee gold tried in the fire, and the white raiment of thy
righteousness, and the anointings of thy blessed Spirit, for I need them
all," without, money and without price."</span></p>

25—Morning—Luke 18:5</h3>
<p>"And the apostles said unto the Lord, increase our faith."—Luke
xviii. 5.</p>
<p>Did the apostles need so to pray? Then well may I. Oh! thou great
author and finisher of our faith! I would look up to thee, with
thankfulness, that thou hast granted even the smallest portion of faith
to so unworthy a creature as I am. Surely, my soul, it is as great a
miracle of grace that my God and Saviour should have kindled belief in
thy stony heart, amidst all the surrounding obstructions of sin and
Satan which lay there, as when the miraculous fire from heaven, in
answer to the prophet's prayer, came down and consumed the wetted
sacrifice. I praise thee, my God and King, this day, in the recollection
of this unspeakable, unmerited mercy. And though this faith in my heart
still be but as a grain of mustard seed; though it be but as a spark in
the ocean; though it be but as the drop of the dew, in comparison of the
river; yet, blessed, precious Jesus! still this is faith, and it is thy
gift. And is it not a token of thy favour? Is it not an earnest of the
Holy Spirit, and a pledge of the promised inheritance? Babes in faith,
as well as the strong in the Lord, are equally thine; for it is said
that "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed; "(Acts xiii.
48.) "and to as many as believed, thou gavest power to become the sons
of God. "So it is by thyself blessed Redeemer, and not by the strength
or weakness of the faith of thy people, their justification before God
the Father is secured. Precious is that scripture which tells us, that
by thee all that believe, whether great faith or little faith—"all that
believe, are justified from all things. "Acts xiii. 39. But, my soul,
while the consciousness of thy possessing the smallest evidences of
faith in thy beloved, gives thee a joy unspeakable and full of glory,
dost thou not blush to think what ungrateful returns thou art making to
thy Redeemer in the littleness of thy faith in such a God and Saviour?
Whence is it that thine affections are so warm in a thousand lesser
things, and so cold towards Jesus? Whence that his holy word thou so
often hearest as though thou heardest not? Whence the ordinances of
Jesus's house, the promises of his scriptures, the visits of his grace;
whence these pass again and again before thee, and thou remainest so
cold and lifeless in thy affections? Whence that the temptations of
Satan, the corruptions of thine heart, the allurements of the world,
gain any influence upon thee? Whence that thou art so anxious about
things that perish; about any thing, about nothing, deserving to be
called interesting; whence so seldom at the court of the heavenly King,
where thou oughtest to be found daily, hourly, waiting; and whence,
under trials, or the want of answers at a mercy-seat, fretful,
impatient, and misgiving—whence all these, and numberless other evils,
but from the weakness and littleness of thy love to Jesus, thy trust in
Jesus, thy dependance upon Jesus, and thy communion with Jesus? All, all
arise out of this one sad cause, my soul, thine unbelief. Jesus, Master,
look upon me, put the cry with earnestness in my heart, that I may
unceasingly, with the apostles' prayer, be sending forth this as the
first and greatest petition of my whole soul—"Lord, increase my faith.

25—Evening—John 21:4, 5</h3>
<p>"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the
disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith unto them,
children, have ye any meat?"—John xxi. 4, 5.</p>
<p>Every incident in relation to Jesus, and his love to his people,
becomes interesting; and here is a very sweet one. Jesus was now risen
from the dead. But his disciples had only faint and indistinct notions
of the immense importance of this glorious event. They therefore were
returned to their employment of fishing, as unconscious of what the
resurrection from the dead should mean. All night they had been employed
in a fruitless pursuit, and when the morning began to dawn, Jesus stood
on the shore; but their eyes were holden, that they did not know him. My
soul! learn from hence, that Jesus is often with thee, often looking on
thee, and often providing and preparing for thee, while thou art
ignorant of his presence and his love. He speaks to them, before they
speak to him. Yes; "if we love him, it is because he first loved us.
"And what doth Jesus say? "children, have ye any meat? "Precious account
of Jesus! My soul, turn over the several blessed particulars shewn in
it. He calls them children. Yes: his people are his children, for he is
the everlasting Father, as well as their Husband and Brother: indeed, he
stands in the place of all relations, and fills all. My soul! if thou
didst but consider this, and keep the remembrance of it always uppermost
in thine heart, how wouldest thou delight to go to Jesus, as to "a
brother born for adversity, a friend that loveth at all times, and one
that sticketh closer than a brother!" Observe how earnest the Lord is
concerning their present state and safety. Oh! that every child of God
in Christ would learn from hence how Jesus takes part in ail that
concerns them. Surely this solicitude of Jesus takes in the whole of a
believer's warfare. Are they poor in this world? Do they seek their
bread out of desolate places? Like the disciples, do they toil all
night, and gain nothing? And shall not He, who providently caters for
the sparrow, know it, and provide for them, amidst all their manifold
necessities? Look up, my poor afflicted brother (if perchance such an
one should read these lines of my Evening Portion); look up, I say, and
behold Jesus in this endearing instance of tenderness to the wants of
his few faithful disciples. He that caused a miraculous draught of
fishes to supply the pressing necessities of his disciples, can, and
will equally now regard the state of all his redeemed, under their
various temporal straights and difficulties. The promise is absolute,
and hath never failed: "thy bread shall be given, and thy waters shah be
sure, and thy defence shall be the munitions of rocks," Isa. xxxiii. 16.
And as for spiritual famine, when at any time the waters of the
sanctuary run low, Jesus is the Almighty Governor, our spiritual Joseph,
through all the Egyptian state of his people here below; and he speaks
to every one, yea, to thee, my soul, in the number: "children, have ye
any meat? "Lamb of God! though thou art now in thine exalted state, yet
not all the church in glory above, nor all the hallelujahs of heaven,
can detain thee one moment from knowing, and visiting, and supplying all
the manifold wants of thy church in grace here below! Doth Jesus say to
me," hast thou any meat? "Lord, I would answer, thou art "the bread of
life, and the bread of God; yea, the living bread, which cometh down
from heaven, and giveth life to the world!" Precious Jesus! be thou my
bread, my life, my hope, my fulness, my joy, and my portion for
ever!</p>

26—Morning—Song of Solomon 4:2</h3>
<p>"Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came
up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren
among them."—Song iv. 2.</p>
<p>See, my soul, how Jesus sets off the beauties of his church, when
made comely in his comeliness, which he hath put upon it. Jesus's whole
church forms but one flock; for there shall be one fold and one
shepherd. And though it is called a little flock, and a flock of
slaughter, yet it is a beautiful flock in the Lord's hand. But wherefore
are the teeth of the church said to be like a flock shorn? Probably,
from their never being exercised but upon divine things: shorn to all
desires in which unshorn and carnal persons delight. The believer feeds
on Jesus: his flesh he finds to be meat indeed, his blood drink indeed:
To the roof of his mouth this becomes, like the best wine," which goeth
down sweetly, causing even the lips of those that sleep to speak. "And
how do believers, like sheep, come up from the washing, but when from
the washing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Ghost shed upon
them abundantly, through Jesus Christ, they come up clean and washed in
Jesus's blood, and adorned in the robe of Jesus's righteousness, and are
presented before God and the Father, and accepted in the Beloved? And Oh
how fruitful are they, like sheep which bear twins! None are barren or
unfruitful among them, because they shew forth the praises of him who
hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light. The twin
graces, if they may be so called, of faith and love, of prayer and
praise, mark whose they are, and to whom they belong. The old fleece of
nature being taken from them, they are shorn to the world, and the
former filthiness and uncleanness of mind, they are washed from to
themselves: and hence they come up to mention the loving-kindness of the
Lord, and to prove that they are neither barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of the Lord, and in the power of his might. My soul, is this
thy state? Are thy teeth like this flock; and thy knowledge and
enjoyment of Jesus a real heartfelt enjoyment of him? Canst thou truly
relish nothing of food but what hath Jesus in it? nothing pleasant to
thy taste but this bread of God, which came down from heaven? Comfort
thyself then, my soul, that by and by the teeth of death will separate,
like the sheep that is shorn, the body of corruption under which thou
still groanest, being burdened; and thou shalt come up from the washing
in the fountain of Jesus's blood, clothed in his garment of salvation,
and made a meet partaker of an inheritance with the saints in light!</p>

loved Jacob, and I hated Esau!"</span><span class="c6">—</span><span
class="c5">Malachi i. 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="c5">My soul! sit down this evening, and ponder over some
few particulars of the characteristics of grace, and behold its
freeness, fulness, unexpectedness, greatness, sovereignty, and
undeservedness; and yet, if possible, more astonishing than either, in
its </span><span class="c6">distinguishing</span><span class="c5">
operations. The Lord himself invites his redeemed people to this blessed
study; and when a poor sinner can receive it, and mark his own interest
in it, nothing more tends to humble the soul to the dust before God, and
compels it to cry out, under a deep sense of its own unworthiness,"
Lord, how is it that thou hast manifested thyself to me, and not unto
the world? "In this demand of God, the question is decided and answered.
"I have loved you, saith the Lord. But ye say, wherein hast thou loved
us? "or as some read it, </span><span class="c6">wherefore</span><span
class="c5"> hast thou done so, when we were utterly undeserving of it?
How is it, Lord, that thy grace was so personally distinguished? To
which the Lord replies," Was not Esau Jacob's brother? yet I loved
Jacob, and hated Esau. "As if Jehovah had said, I have been pointing out
my distinguishing love from the beginning. Was not Esau Jacob's brother;
yea, his </span><span class="c6">elder</span><span class="c5"> brother?
And had any right of inheritance arisen by birth, or from my covenant
with Abraham, was not Esau before Jacob? Yet, to shew the freeness and
sovereignty of my decrees," before the children were born, or had done
either good or evil," it was said by me," The elder shall serve the
younger."—Lord! help me to bow down under a deep sense of thy
sovereignty, and to cry out with the patriarch," Shall not the Judge of
all the earth do right? "or in the precious words of the patriarch's
Lord," Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. "My soul!
sit down, and trace the wonderful subject all the bible through; and
when thou hast done that, ponder over thine own experience, and fall low
to the dust of the earth, in token that it is, and ever must be, from
the same distinguishing grace alone, that one man differs from another;
for all that we have is what we first received. And how marvellous is
the distinguishing nature of grace, when passing by </span><span
class="c6">some</span><span class="c5"> that we might think more
deserving, to single out others apparently the most worthless and
undeserving. The </span><span class="c6">young man</span><span
class="c5"> in the gospel, full of good deeds, and, as he thought,
within a step of heaven, shall go away from Christ very sorrowful; while
Paul, in the midst of his hatred of Jesus, and making havoc of his
people, shall be called. Nay, my soul! look not at these only, but look
at thyself. Where wert thou, when Jesus passed by, and bid thee live?
How wast thou engaged, when grace first taught thine eyes to overflow;
and he that persuadeth Japheth to dwell in the tents of Shem, persuaded
thee, and constrained thee by his love? And what is it now but the same
distinguishing love, and grace, and favour, that keeps thee, under all
thy wanderings, and coldness, and backslidings, from falling away! Who
but Jesus could keep the immortal spark of grace from going out, amidst
those floods of corruption which arise within? Who but Jesus could
prevent the incorruptible seed from being choked for ever, which at
times seems to be wholly encompassed with weeds, or buried in the
rubbish of thy sinful nature? Precious Lord Jesus! let others say what
they may, or think what they will, be it my portion to lie low in the
deepest self-abasement, under the fullest conviction that it is thy free
grace, and not creature desert, which makes all the difference between
man and man! Oh! for the teachings of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, to
accompany all my views of this most wonderful subject! And when at any
time pride would arise in my heart, or any supposed excellency in me,
compared to others, or when beholding the state of the vain or the
carnal, Oh! for grace to hear that voice speaking and explaining all;
"Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord; yet! loved Jacob, and
Esau have I hated."</span></p>

27—Morning—John 11:36</h3>
<p>"Behold how he loved him!"—John xi. 36.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> The tears of Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus produced
that astonishment in the mind of the Jews, that they thus exclaimed! But
had they known, or did the whole world know, what I know of thy love to
me, thou dear Redeemer of my soul, every one that heard it might with
greater wonder cry out," Behold how he loveth him!" I would for the
present pass by, in my contemplation of thy love, all the numberless
instances of it, which I possess in common with thy church and people;
for though these in every and in all cases carry with them the tokens of
a love that passeth knowledge, yet, for the meditation of the morning, I
would pause over the view of Jesus's love to me a poor sinner, not as it
is displayed in </span><span class="c6">general</span><span class="c5">
mercies, even the glorious mercies of redemption, but as those mercies
come home, in their </span><span class="c6">peraonal</span><span
class="c5"> direction of them to my own heart, even to mine. Think, my
soul, what a huge volume thou wilt have to read over in eternity, of
Jesus's love to thee, as </span><span class="c6">distinguished, express,
personal</span><span class="c5">, and </span><span
class="c6">partieular</span><span class="c5">. And, amidst all the
several chapters of that love, how wilt thou dwell with rapture on those
two sweet verses of it, which, like the hymn in one of the psalms, thou
wilt have to chaunt aloud, after the review of every blessing noted
down; "for his mercy endureth for ever. "I mean, </span><span
class="c6">first</span><span class="c5">, that Jesus should ever look
with pity on thee; and </span><span class="c6">next</span><span
class="c5"> to this, that after such distinguishing grace, the floods of
sin and corruption in thee should not have quenched that love, and
extinguished it for ever. The thought of Jesus's love, if looked at only
in these two points of view, will be enough to employ thy immortal
faculties in contemplation, and love, and praise to all eternity. Pause,
my soul, and take a short view of each. Jesus looked on thee, loved
thee, called thee, redeemed thee, manifested himself to thee, otherwise
than he doth to the world; and this at a time when thousands and tens of
thousands are passed by, of temper, mind, disposition, and
understanding, in every point of view vastly thy superiors, and far more
promising to glorify him. Bow down, my soul, while thou ponderest over
the rich mercy, and refer all the praise and all the glory unto him,
whose free grace, not thy deserts, became the sole cause. And when thou
hast fully turned this astonishing subject over in thy mind, think
again, that after such distinguishing grace, how increasingly
astonishing it is that all thy repeated and aggravated transgressions
have not extinguished this love towards thee, but that Jesus still
loves, though thou hast been, and still continuest, so ungrateful. Oh
love unequaled, past all comprehension! When shall this base, this
shameful heart of mine so love thee, as to live to thy glory? Lord, I
abhor myself in this view of thy grace and my vileness!</span></p>

27—Evening—John 20:11</h3>
<p>"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping; and as she wept,
she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre."—John xx. 11.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul! in this woman, a delightful instance of what thy
love should be to thy Lord. If at any time thou dost miss thy Jesus, and
longest for his return, where wouldest thou expect him.? Surely at his
ordinances, in his word, at his throne of grace, where Jesus "feedeth
his kids by the footsteps of the flock, and beside the shepherds' tents.
"How do men of the world pursue the object of their wishes, but where it
is to be found? Are they thirsty? they haste to drink. Are they cold?
they, seek the fire. Follow this plan. If Jesus be away, seek him where
he hath directed thee to come. So Mary waited at the sepulchre; and as
she waited, she looked in, while she wept, to see the place where Jesus
had lain. Sweet view of a sincere seeker! The heart and eye are both
engaged, and all the affections are going forth in desire. The angels
addressed Mary; but the sight of angels could not satisfy her, till
Jesus himself came. It is worthy of remark, that the first appearance
the Lord Jesus made of himself, after he arose from the dead, was to
this woman, out of whom he had cast seven devils. And it is yet farther
remarkable, that the first words which Jesus spake after the glorious
event of his resurrection, was to Mary Magdalene! He passed by the whole
of the apostles, to give Mary this. distinguished honour. Mary stood at
the door of the sepulchre, weeping, but the apostles had returned to
their own homes; and the Lord Jesus rewarded that waiting. "Woman,"
saith Jesus, "why weepest thou?" As if the Son of God had said, "What
cause can there be now to weep, since all the ruins of the fall are done
away, and sin, death, hell, and the grave, with all their tremendous
consequences, are destroyed for ever?" I hope I do not mistake, but I
think this feature in the character of the Lord Jesus, is calculated to
dry up every tear from every eye of his redeemed. It seems to speak in
the language of that precious scripture: "For the people shall dwell in
Zion at Jerusalem. Thou shalt weep no more. He will be very gracious,
unto thee, at the voice of thy cry: when he shall hear it, he will
answer thee," Isaiah xxx. 19. My soul! do not fail to take with thee the
many blessed improvements, which the waiting of Mary, and the grace of
Jesus in thus rewarding that waiting, brings with it. There is no
interruption, no pause in Jesus's love. In reading that sweet volume,
there are no stops, no, not a comma, but what we ourselves make. And if
at any time we find ourselves come to the bottom of a page full of the
relations of Jesus and his love, it is only to turn over the leaf, and
there we find the continuation of the same blessed subject. Now, my
soul! learn, from Mary, to take thy stand where she stood; not at the
sepulchre of Jesus, for he is risen, as he said, and we are commanded
not to seek the living among the dead; but we are to follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth, and to look at Christ upon his throne of glory.
Nevertheless, as the angels said to those who sought Christ at the tomb,
"Come, see the place where the Lord lay!" so we may by faith often view
that memorable sepulchre; and precious will be the meditation, as Mary's
was. And, my soul, do not forget who it was that led Mary thither, and
gave her those sympathies, and at length converted her sorrow into the
most heartfelt joy. Oh! it is blessed, it is precious, to be kept in the
way, "the good old way," of waiting upon the Lord. He is always near,
and though he may for awhile seem to conceal himself, yet he will be
found of them that seek him. He saith himself, "It shall come to pass,
before my people call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
will hear. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shah answer; thou shalt
cry, and he shall say, here I am!" Blessed Jesus! do thou by me, do thou
by all thy children, who seek thee sorrowing, as thou didst by Mary, and
as thou dost by all thy people; "Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? "And when our souls reply, "It is Jesus alone we seek," Oh, then,
to hear our own names called upon, as her's was, Mary! and in such a way
as to draw forth every affection of the heart in our answer," Rabboni!
my Lord and my God!"</p>

<p><span class="c5"> Was David singled out from amidst his brethren, to
be the Lord's anointed; and do I not behold in this the representation
of Jesus, that Holy One, concerning whom the Lord spake in vision, and
said, I have laid help upon One that is mighty; I have exalted One
chosen out of the people? Yes, thou Lord our righteousness, in this I
behold thee. And let my soul make this sweet subject the meditation of
my morning song, for surely it is a lovely song, to hail thee the
chiefest among ten thousand. I behold thee then, thou dear Emanuel, by
the eye of faith, as coming up from everlasting, when amidst that
immense multitude of those thou disdainest not to call thy brethren,
thou stoodest forth, in the eternal view, as the glorious One, to be the
Christ, the God-man Mediator, for the salvation of thy church and
people. Here, precious Jesus, didst thou appear, to God our Father's
view, pre-eminent above thy fellows. And of the whole body, the church,
which God our Father in the great decree determined to form as the
receivers of grace and mercy, and of eternal life and salvation, thou
wert appointed their glorious Head; and </span><span

class="c6">through</span><span class="c5"> thee, they might become a
glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that
thou mightest present it to thyself in love. And surely, dearest,
precious Jesus, had every individual of thy redeemed brethren been
present, as all the Sons of Jesse passed in review before the prophet,
to have chosen their glorious head, on none but thee could that choice
have fallen. All voices would have echoed to Jehovah's proclamation:
"Arise, anoint him; for this is he. "Yes! truly, Lord, thou art he whom
thy brethren shall praise; and all thy Father's children, with devout
rapture and holy joy, shall bow down before thee. Thou art heir of all
things, the chiefest and first, born in the womb of mercy. It is thou
that art entitled to the most full, honourable, and unchangeable right
to all thy Father's inheritance. "Men shall be blessed in thee, and all
nations shall call thee blessed. "My soul, delight thyself unceasingly
in this contemplation of thy Jesus. God thy Father hath chosen him. He
hath anointed him with the holy oil for salvation, and the Spirit was
given unto him, not by measure. And is not God's chosen thy chosen; the
Father's anointed, thine anointed? Is there any in heaven, or upon
earth, to whom thou art looking for help, or strength, or comfort, or
salvation, but to Jesus? Who but Jesus, my soul, wouldest thou have for
a Saviour? What object so desirable as Jesus, to claim thy love? Witness
for me, ye sons of light, ye angels that see his face and do his
pleasure, that Jesus is my only beloved, my hope, my portion. Shortly I
shall join your assembly, and with you bless and adore Jesus in endless
song, the fairest and chiefest among ten thousand.</span></p>

28—Evening—Luke 24:15, 16</h3>
<p>"Jesus himself drew near, and went with them; but their eyes were
holden, that they should not know him."—Luke xxiv. 15, 16.</p>
<p>My soul! here is a most interesting subject proposed to thine evening
meditation, in this account of an interview between Jesus and two of his
disciples, in the interval between his resurrection and ascension. Sit
down, and under the divine teaching, ponder it well. Were the eyes of
those disciples so holden, that they should not know him, from some
supernatural effect wrought on their powers of vision; or was it induced
from any alteration wrought upon the person of their Lord? Probably
there might be a concurrence of both these causes. The effect
accomplished by this interview seems indeed to shew it; but it is
profitable, highly profitable, to exercise our meditation upon it,
though the point cannot be determined. I think it more than probable,
that death had given an aspect to Jesus, which in itself must have
induced a change. That face which once, in the days of his flesh, brake
forth as the sun when shining in his strength, at the mount of
transfiguration, might now have appeared with paleness, from the sweat,
and dust, and blood, spread over the countenance. But, however this
might have been, so it was, their eyes were holden, that they should not
know him. Precious Lord Jesus! cause me to learn from hence, that all
the gracious manifestations which thou art pleased to make of thyself to
thy people, are of thyself, and depend upon thy sovereign will and
pleasure; and cause me to learn also, how very gracious thou art, to
condescend at any time, by the sweet influences of thy Spirit, to reveal
thyself to thy people, and to manifest thyself to them, otherwise than
thou doest to the world. And hence, Lord, I beseech thee, very
frequently to draw nigh, and go with me, as thou didst with them; and
though mine eyes be holden, so as that I do not discern thee, yet, like
them, thy gracious discourse will make mine heart burn within me, while
thou art walking with me by the way, and while thou art opening to me
thy scriptures. And, especially, do by me as thou didst by them, when at
thy table, or in thine house of worship; give me an open communication
of thy glory "in breaking of bread, and in prayer."—My soul! do not
dismiss this interesting account of the appearance of Jesus, before thou
hast taken another view of thy Redeemer. It was a solemn moment in which
it took place. The Son of God had finished redemption work; but he was
not as yet ascended to his Father. Behold him for a moment, and
contemplate his person in that interval!—Jesus in his human nature,
though his visage was marred more than any man's, and his form more than
the sons of men, is yet said to have been fairer than the children of
men, because grace was poured into his lips, and Jehovah had blessed him
for ever. And as he was altogether free from sin, so was he"the
altogether lovely." And as he was now raised from the dead, though not
yet exalted to the right hand of power, yet surely that human nature of
Jesus, in union with the Godhead, and worshipped by angels, must have
possessed a glory unspeakably blessed and divine. The way to judge of
the appearance of thy Jesus, at this time, is from the conduct of the
angels towards him. Fromtheir ministration to him in the garden, and at
the sepulchre, and especially their attendance on him at his return to
glory, it is easy to gather in what light they gazed on Christ. Such an
assemblage of glory as the human nature of the Lord Jesus possessed, and
derived from its personal union with the Godhead, called forth at once
the love, and adoration, and delight of all the angels of heaven. They
saw holiness in the person of Jesus, in all its perfection; and every
grace, in wisdom, truth, and knowledge, in their highest properties.
Hence their views oœ Christ may very safely be made the standard of
ours. Hail then, thou blessed Emanuel! Let this interval between thy
resurrection and ascension, be ever sacred to my soul. And while I
behold thee as lovely, fair, and glorious, in every eye, both of angels
and thy redeemed, be thou increasingly lovely and precious in mine also.
And let it be my delight to talk of thee by the way, and when lying down
or rising up. And Oh! do thou always draw near to me, thou blessed Lord,
though my dim-sighted apprehension of thee doth so often prevent me from
enjoying thy presence. Yet a little while, and thou wilt call me home,
to behold thy glory unveiled with a cloud, or any intervening object,
where I shall behold thee as thou art, and dwell with thee for ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>"The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
"—Rev, xix. 7, 8.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul, behold that day, that glorious day, in which
redemption is to be consummated, and in the kingdom of heaven; when the
Son of God brings home his bride, the church, the full celebration of
God's glory in the happiness of the redeemed in Jesus, everlasting joy
will burst forth. See how thy nature is then to be adorned. The whole
body, the church, is then to be arrayed in the robes of Jesus's
righteousness, having been washed from all their sins in his blood. And
these nuptial ornaments are to be granted or given to the church; for
she hath no righteousness of her own; but as all along in this world she
had professed, so there in the upper world she triumphantly sings," I
will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for
he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me
with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with
ornaments, and as a' bride adorneth herself with her jewels. "Isa. lxi.
10. Pause, my soul, over this view. Is this to be thy adorning in glory?
See to it then, my soul, that it becomes thy covering now. How suited is
it to all thy circumstances! Thou hast no fine linen, nothing clean,
nothing white. Think how comely Jesus's robe of righteousness must be to
appear in. This is the wedding garment, by faith worn at his supper upon
earth, and the same in fruition in which thou art to sit down at his
table above. And Oh how suitable a covering to hide all thy deformity,
to conceal and take away all thy pollution. And will not this procure
thee favour and acceptance with God? Is it not thus that Jesus's
followers are distinguished from men of the world? Art thou now clothed
with it? Hath God the Spirit put it on? Doth Jesus now send thee his
love-tokens as his betrothed; and, in the ordinances of his grace, doth
he grant thee many sweet espousals? Oh then, my soul, see to it, that
thy righteousness is that of Jesus's own, with which his church is
arrayed, and that these robes are always clean and white, which are
washed in the blood of the Lamb: for, ere long, the midnight cry will be
heard; "Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him!" Oh
precious Lord Jesus! give me to hear that voice with joy, that, with
holy wings of love, in the last office of faith, to be then swallowed up
in sight, I may arise to enter with thee into the marriage, to sit down

Peter 3:4</h3>
<p>"The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price. "—I Pet. iii. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! where is this to be had? Hast thou
considered it in its importance, or in its attainment; whence it cometh,
and on whose account it is given? Sit down, this evening, and ponder
over it. What is a meek and quiet spirit, but grace, in all its blessed
properties and saving effects, keeping the heart and mind through Christ
Jesus? Now mark </span><span class="c6">some</span><span class="c5"> of
the many precious things belonging to it. The fountain of it is God; for
"every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
of turning,'' James i. 17. It is also the purchase of Christ's blood,
and the fruit of the Holy Ghost; and so infinitely important in its
operation, that believers are said thereby "to be made partakers of the
divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
through lust," 2 Pet. i. 4. And what a lustre doth the possession of it
impart to the whole man? Being a portion of the same Spirit which was
given to the manhood of Jesus </span><span class="c6">without
measure</span><span class="c5">; it produces a resemblance and
similitude in the character of every renewed soul to him. As a fair and
beautiful countenance gives a loveliness to the </span><span
class="c6">natural</span><span class="c5"> form, so grace is that which
gives the whole that can be called blessed, or engaging to the
</span><span class="c6">spiritual</span><span class="c5">. Hence a poor
man with grace in his heart, is infinitely more lovely in the sight of
God, than the persons of the great void of it, though the blood of kings
were to flow through their veins. It is this which is the source, and it
is this which gives the finishing gracefulness to the whole man. And as
it flows </span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> God, so
all its tendencies are to God. Next to the person of Jesus, the
</span><span class="c6">grace</span><span class="c5"> of Jesus, is, or
ought to be, the one earnest object and desire of every soul. Until we
have this ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, every man by nature, in
the sight of God, is of no esteem. There can be nothing lovely or
desirable in the unregenerate. "lie that liveth in pleasure, is dead
while he liveth," saith the scripture, I Tim. v. 6. And however, to our
view, the actions of such may carry with them much moral sweetness, yet
as those actions are not quickened from the Spirit of grace, they are no
other than as flowers strewed over the bodies of the dead. They are of
no esteem in the sight of God. The </span><span
class="c6">person</span><span class="c5"> must be first sanctified by
grace, and then the </span><span class="c6">action</span><span
class="c5"> follows. The Lord had respect </span><span
class="c6">first</span><span class="c5"> to Abel, and </span><span
class="c6">then</span><span class="c5"> to his offering; but as to Cain,
as he had no respect, so neither could his offering be acceptable; Gen.
iv. 4, 5. My soul! what saith thy experience to these things? Hast thou
this precious grace, this saving grace, this sanctifying grace, which
flows at once from God the Father's gift, the blood and righteousness of
Jesus Christ, and the regenerating influences of God the Holy Ghost? Are
those blessed effects wrought in thee, which saving grace is sure to
work? Is God's glory your delight; his Christ your Christ; his salvation
your salvation? Hast thou felt the renewing, transforming, confirming,
establishing principles of grace, flowing in from the Spirit of Jesus
upon thy spirit, so that the new man is "renewed in knowledge, after the
image of him that created him?" In a word, hast thou so beheld, as in a
glass," the glory of the Lord, that thou art changed into the same
image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord? "If, my
soul, thou hast these blessed tokens, these ornaments of a meek and
quiet spirit, which are in the sight of God of great price: then dost
thou possess that which all the world can neither give nor take away.
"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the
price thereof. "Precious Jesus! it is the purchase of thy blood, it
comes from the sovereign gift of God the Father, and is the earnest of
the Holy Spirit! Lord, seal my soul with it "to the day of eternal
redemption!"</span></p>

30—Morning—Psalm 73:23</h3>
<p>"Nevertheless, I am continually with thee. "—Ps. Ixxiii. 23.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Yes, my soul, and well it is for thee that it is
so; there is a </span><span class="c6">nevertheless</span><span
class="c5"> in the precious redemption by Jesus, which secures thee,
amidst all thy languishing seasons, when to thy view it sometimes
appears as though the Lord had forgotten to be gracious, and had shut up
his loving-kindness in displeasure. And whence this security but in
Jesus, and the covenant engagements of God thy Father in him? The
everlasting worth and efficacy of the Redeemer's righteousness and
death, are the same amidst all the changeable circumstances of his
people's warfare. By the expression of being continually with Jesus, is
meant, no doubt, that union with his person, as the sinner's Surety,
which gives security and firmness to the everlasting state and happiness
of his redeemed. And it is this which constitutes, not only the safety
of his people now, but the happiness of his people for ever. Heaven
itself, but for Jesus, and the constant flow of righteousness and glory
in him, and from him, would cease to be heaven. The souls of just men
made perfect could be no longer happy nor righteous, but as those
supplies flow in upon their souls from him. So that the everlasting
preciousness of Jesus, as the glorious Head of his people, is thus
confirmed, and the felicity of the church must be wholly made up from
this eternal union with him. Hence how precious the thought, "I am
continually with thee!" And is this thy portion, my soul? Art thou alive
to this sweet and soul-reviving thought? Is Jesus, thy Jesus,
continually with thee, and thou continually with him? See to it, that
the nearness of Jesus to thee hath the same effect upon thee, as with
things in nature, when the earth and the inhabitants testify their sense
of feeling. Doth not the earth, and the plants, and the birds, and every
thing look gay when the sun renews the face of the earth, and shines
with loveliness to make all nature smile? And shall thy Sun of
Righteousness arise unobserved or unenjoyed, who comes with healing in
his wings? Oh precious Jesus, cause me so to live upon thee, that I may
be always eyeing thee, in dark seasons as well as bright hours; that,
from never suffering thy dear image to depart for a moment from my
heart, I may be so prepared to behold thy face in open glory, when the
veil of this flesh is removed, and I awake up after thy likeness, that,
though I change my place, I shall not change my company. In earth, or
heaven, yet, if with thee, happiness is begun in the soul; and faith, in
lively exercise, is itself an anticipation of glory, by just so much as
the soul realizeth thy sweet presence, in being ever with the
Lord.</span></p>

Samuel 12:24</h3>
<p>"Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth, with all your heart; for
consider how great things he hath done for you. "—I Sam. xii. 24.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> How truly affectionate was this pastoral advice of
the prophet to Israel, in the close of recapitulating Israel's history,
and God's love over them! My soul! take this portion from Israel's
history, and apply it to thine own; for the argument, and the reason
upon which the argument is founded, are one and the same; and thou wilt
find .the same causes, both from interest in Christ,. and from received
mercies from Christ, to form the same conclusion. But at what part of
thine history wilt thou begin, or where wilt thou end, in considering
</span><span class="c6">what great things</span><span class="c5"> thy
God, thy Jesus, hath done for thee? Wilt thou open with the
consideration of God's mercies towards thee in nature, or providence, or
grace? What arithmetic will be competent to score the vast account, even
in a thousandth degree, of either of those departments; much more if
thou weft to study the subject in all? Who indeed can be sufficient to
note them down, or to state in order, as they passed before him, the
numberless events which testified divine favour, during the long season
of thine </span><span class="c6">unregeneracy?</span><span class="c5">
What a huge volume might be formed in nature only, of the Lord's
watchfulness, providings, preservings, and ordinations, in making all
minister and become subservient to our welfare? Oh! it is blessed to
consider, even if it were here only, what great things the Lord hath
done for us. And while we mark the footsteps of his love, and note our
wanderings from him; when we trace back the wonderful subject of
distinguishing mercy, and call to mind the grates of some, yea, many,
with whom were spent our youthful days, while we remain not only the
</span><span class="c6">spared</span><span class="c5">, but we hope the
</span><span class="c6">saved</span><span class="c5"> monuments of free
sovereign grace and mercy; well may we exclaim, with one of old," Bless
the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits; who redeemeth thy
life from destruction, and crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender
mercies!" And if from the outer court of nature and providence, our
souls enter into the inner court of grace, and there mark down, since
the day of our </span><span class="c6">regeneracy</span><span
class="c5"> and the Lord's effectual calling, what great things he hath
done for us, surely it would tire the arm of an angel to write the whole
account. Precious Lord Jesus! in thee, and by thee, and from thee, all
our mercies flow. Thou art the first, the last, the best, the
comprehensive gift of God; the channel of all blessings temporal,
spiritual, and eternal; through whom all the streams come, from Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost; and through whom all love and praise return; not
only the channel through whom they come, but the substance in whom they
centre. Thou hast purchased them, and they are enjoyed wholly from our
union with thee; and their continuation in grace here, and glory to all
eternity, must result from thee: all the covenant mercies of God in
Christ, are "the sure mercies of David" on thy account! Think, then, my
soul! what causes thou art surrounded with, in the great things God hath
done for thee, that thou shouldest fear the Lord, and serve him in
truth, with all thine heart! Close then the month as thou hopest to
close thy life on earth, with this sweet scripture; and as thou didst
open the month in contemplating the Lord thy righteousness, as the name
whereby thou are enjoined to call him, so now let thy last meditation,
before thou droppest to sleep in ending the month, be with the same. "He
is (as Moses told Israel) thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done
for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
"Be this, therefore, thy daily meditation, and thine evening hymn: "to
fear the Lord, and serve him; for consider how great things he hath done
for thee." Amen.</span></p>

1—Morning—Matthew 1:21</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt call his name Jesus."—Matt. i. 21.</p>
<p>This is one more of the Redeemer's names, which is as ointment poured
forth. As if the Holy Ghost had been graciously consulting the
everlasting comfort and happiness of his people, and therefore commanded
the church to know their Lord, by so many different and endearing
appellations. As if he bad said, are you kept back from approaching him
through fear? Oh no;—go to him, for he is Emanuel. So great, as God,
that he is able to save; so tender and near, as man, that he is more
ready to bestow mercy than you are to ask it. Are you kept back for want
of righteousness? Be not so, for he is the Lord our righteousness, and
what you need he hath for you. Or, are you depressed by reason of sin?
Let not this discourage you, for his name is purposely Jesus, because
he, and he alone," shall save his people from their sins. "My soul, what
knowest thou practically and personally of this most blessed name of thy
Saviour? It is one thing to have heard of him as Jesus, and another to
know him to be Jesus, There are multitudes who rest satisfied with the
name. The Jews knew him, saw him, conversed with him; but they knew him
not as a Saviour. Nay more than this, many have had, and still have, an
historical knowledge and belief that Jesus is a Saviour, but yet no
apprehension or concern for an interest in him. Thus Balaam, whose eyes
were so far opened, but his heart never affected, as to have visions
concerning Christ. But what an awful account did this impious creature
give of himself! "I shall see him, (said he) but not now; I shall
behold, him, but not nigh."—Numb, xxiv. 17. What an awful state! O my
soul, bless thy God, thy Jesus, that thy knowledge is not of the head
only, but of the heart. Thou hast not simply heard of Jesus, but
received him as Jesus, to the salvation of thy soul. Thou hast seen God
in Christ; the Father's name, the Father's authority in him. Thou hast
come to him in that name, and by that authority, as a poor sinner, and
found Jesus precious. And is not Jesus precious to thee? Is not the very
name of Jesus most precious? As one of old expressed it, so hast thou
found it, that in this one name of thy Lord, the whole of the gospel is
folded up; it is the light, the food, the medicine, the very jubilee of
the soul. Yes, thou blessed, holy, gracious Lord! Yes, thy name is
indeed Jesus, for thou art, thou wilt be Jesus. "And they that know thy
name will put their trust in thee, for thou shalt save thy people from
their sins."</p>

1—Evening—Deuteronomy 28:58</h3>
<p>"That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY
GOD."—Deut. xxviii. 58.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! thy </span><span
class="c6">morning</span><span class="c5"> meditation, in the opening of
a new month, was directed to that soul-reviving subject, the
contemplation of the name of Jesus. Oh! what rich stores of unknown,
unexplored treasures of mercies are folded in that one name of thy Lord!
It will serve to heighten thy study yet more, and tend to endear Jesus
as increasingly precious, by pondering over what the man of God taught
Israel in the solemn words here proposed to thine </span><span
class="c6">evenig</span><span class="c5"> meditation. Every thing in
Jehovah is solemn. His sweetest mercies come to us with great
sacredness. It is impossible to receive them but with the lowliest
reverence, even when the soul is made blessed in divine favours. We
rejoice indeed, but we rejoice with trembling. And the greater the
mercies are, the more will the conscious sense of our undeservings
humble the soul to the dust before God. The Israelites were taught by
this scripture, that the great design of Jehovah, in all his
dispensations, was to induce a suitable and becoming reverence for this
glorious and fearful name of THE LORD THEIR GOD. And his sacred name is
here put in large letters, by way of intimating its immense dignity and
importance. His name is glorious, because it sets forth how that glory
of Jehovah is manifested in his covenant engagements by CHRIST; and his
name is no less fearful, because it is by virtue of those covenant
engagements that the Lord is pledged to bring all the foes of Christ and
his redemption under his footstool. There seems to be a reference to the
oath of Jehovah, when Christ was introduced into his high priestly
office, that the Lord, at Messiah's right hand," would strike through
kings in the day of his wrath;" Psalm cx. 4, 5. And it should seem no
less evident, that this very name, glorious and fearful as it is, was
thus expressly proclaimed to intimate, that, by virtue of this oath,
Jehovah is engaged as much, on the one part, to fulfil the threatenings,
as, on the other, to make good the promises; both of which were rendered
firm and irrevocable by the solemnity of an oath. My soul! ponder over
these most sacred things with a reverence suited to them. And in these
awful days, in which the church of Jesus is now surrounded with the
dreadful delusion of heresy, in those who deny the Lord that bought
them, see to it, that thou art strong in the grace which is in Christ
Jesus. Oh! the blessedness of "knowing whom thou hast believed, that
thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD." Thy
Lord, thy God in covenant; in his relation to thee in Christ, thy
perfect redemption by Christ, and thy acceptance from Christ, in his
finished salvation. Oh! did the sinner of every description and
character, but for a moment consider what he is doing, who is looking to
this glorious and fearful name of the Lord God, without knowing him as
his God, that is, God in Christ, the Mediator, and being accepted in
him; what dreadful trembling and apprehension of soul would it induce!
Bless thy God, thy Jesus, my soul, who hath thus made a sweet revelation
of himself to thee, and not only taught thee, but inclined thee by the
teachings and influences of his Holy Spirit, to fear "this glorious and
fearful name, the Lord thy God!"</span></p>

2—Morning—Genesis 24:58</h3>
<p>"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
man? And she said, I will go."—Gen, xxiv. 58.</p>
<p>See, my soul, with what readiness Rebekah determined to accompany the
servant of Abraham to Isaac. And wilt thou not arise and go forth at the
invitation of the servants of Jesus, who sends them to call thee to his
arms? Hath he not, by the sweet constraining influences of his Holy
Spirit, as well as by the outward ministry of his blessed word, made
thee willing in the day of his power? Did the servant of Abraham give an
earnest of his master's affection in putting the bracelets upon
Rebekah's hands, and the ear-rings, and the gold? But what was this to
the love-tokens which Jesus himself hath given thee, when he set thee as
a seal upon his heart, and as a seal upon his arm, and when all the
waters of divine wrath his holy soul had poured upon him for thy sins,
and all the floods of corruption, which like a deluge, had overspread
thy whole nature, could not quench his love, nor drown it. And if it be
demanded, then, from thine own mouth this day, "Wilt thou go with this
man," this Godman, this Glory-man, this Jesus? Wilt thou not instantly
cry out, "I wilt go?" Yes! thou altogether lovely Lord, thou chiefest
and fairest among ten thousand, I will go with thee. I would forget mine
own people .and my father's house. For my father's house is an house of
bondage. I was born in sin, and shapen in iniquity. A child of wrath,
even as others, and by nature dead in trespasses and sins. It is thou,
blessed Jesus, who hast delivered me from the wrath to come. It is thou
who hast quickened me by thy Holy Spirit to a new and spiritual life. It
is thou who hast sent thy servants to call me to thyself, and hast
betrothed me to thyself for ever. And is there any that yet asketh me,
"wilt thou go with this man? My whole soul would outrun the question,
and, like the apostle, I would answer, "to whom else shall I go?"
Witness for me, ye servants of my Lord; ye angels, and ministers of
light. I have none in heaven, neither in earth, but him. Yes, thou
dearest Redeemer! I will go with thee, follow thee, live with thee, hang
upon thee, die with thee, nor even death itself shall part thee and me.
Oh let those precious words of thine, concerning thy church, be sweetly,
felt in my soul. "I will say, it is my people: "and my whole soul will
make her responses to the gracious sound, and say," the Lord is my
God."</p>

2—Evening—Daniel 2:34, 35</h3>
<p>"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay, and brake them to
pieces.—And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and
filled the whole earth. "—Dan. ii. 34, 35.</p>
<p>Ponder well, my soul, this wonderful vision of the heathen king, and
mark its several features. If the Lord be about to bless and comfort his
people, how often is it done by ways the most opposite and unlikely,
according to our apprehension of things! It shall be accomplished, even
by their enemies, and they who wish most to afflict them, shall not
unfrequently be made the unconscious instruments of doing the very
reverse of what they intend; as in the instance before us, to which
these words in the writings of the prophet Daniel refer. The church was
now in captivity; oppressed, and brought very low: the king, in whose
dominions they were in their vassalage, a despotic tyrant, whose word
became the chief law. The Lord visits this monarch's mind with a vision
of the night: he is troubled with what he had seen iu his vision; but
when he awakes, the remembrance of what he had seen vanished. Daniel is
blessed of the Lord, both to bring to his recollection his thoughts in
the night, and to give the interpretation of them. The king's heart is
for the time subdued, and Daniel honoured with favour. But the most
eminent point of this vision was for' the church's comfort, and the Lord
caused his people to rejoice in the discovery of it. The image to be
destroyed represented the several monarchies of the world, before the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the order in which they should
succeed each other. The Chaldean took the lead, and the Persian
followed; to which succeeded the Grecian; and during the fourth, which
was the Roman power, the Lord Jesus Christ," the stone cut out without
hands," was to arise, which should destroy the image, become "a
mountain, and fill the earth. "What a wonderful coincidence of
circumstances must it have been, that made every minute point in this
representation, to answer so exactly to Jesus, and to him only! The
birth of Christ, produced without the intervention of a human father;
nothing could more strikingly set forth, than the figure of "a stone cut
out 'without hands. "And the triumph of his spiritual kingdom was
equally beautiful, in the similitude of breaking in pieces "the image
which, stood on his feet. "And when what is said of Christ is
considered, which must finally be fulfilled in him, that "the kingdoms
of the world shall become the kingdoms Of our Lord, and of his Christ,
and he shall reign for ever; "who doth not, or will not, see the
striking representation of a mountain springing up from slender
beginnings," and filling the whole earth? "My soul! wilt thou not learn,
this evening, from this very precious scripture, to appreciate thy
Jesus, and to behold how sweetly scripture testimony confirms every
thing concerning him? Teach me, thou dear Lord, to view thee under those
delightful characters; and while I trace back the history of thine
incarnation, low, humble, and despised, as "a stone cut without hands;"
Oh! give me to contemplate thy glory in what most assuredly shall be
accomplished, when "like a mountain established on the tops of a
mountain, all nations shall flow to thee, and thou shalt fill the
earth." Divine Master! fill my whole soul with thyself; and let this our
land, and our people, be filled with the knowledge of Jesus and his
great salvation," as the waters cover the sea!"</p>

8:35</h3>
<p>"Sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind."—Luke
viii. 35.</p>
<p>Look at this man, my soul, and see whether thou canst find any
resemblance to thyself. Before that he heard the voice of Jesus, he was
under the possession of the evil spirit. It is said of him, that he wore
no clothes. He dwelt in no house, but abode among the tombs. He was
cutting himself with stones. No man could tame him, neither fetters nor
chains bind him. Poor miserable creature! And yet, my soul, was not this
a true emblem of thy state; and indeed, of every man's state by nature?
Had not Satan full possession of thine heart and affections, my soul,
before that thou becamest savingly acquainted with the Lord Jesus
Christ? Did he not lead thee in the pursuit and gratification of thy
lusts and pleasure at his will? Thou mightest truly be said to wear no
clothes; for so far from having on the garment of Jesus's righteousness,
in those days of thine unregeneracy, thou wert naked to thy shame, in
the filth of nature. Thou didst not dwell in the house of God, nor even
delight to go thither. And, as this poor creature abode among the dead,
so didst thou live and abide with characters like thyself, dead in
trespasses and sins. And as this miserable man was wounding himself with
stones, so wert thou; for thy daily commission of sin was giving wounds
to thy soul, infinitely more alarming than the wounds he gave his body.
And could no chains or fetters be found strong enough to bind him? So
neither did all the solemn commands and threatening judgments of God's
holy law act with the least restraint upon thine ungoverned passions.
Pause, my soul, over the representation, and acknowledge how just and
striking the similarity. Then ask thyself, art thou now sitting at the
feet of Jesus, clothed and in thy right mind? Yes! if so be like this
poor man, thou hast heard the voice of Jesus, and felt the power of his
grace in thine heart. If one like the Son of God hath set thee free,
brought thee to his fold, opened thine ear to discipline, and thine
heart, to grace, then art thou free indeed. What sayest thou, my soul,
to these things? Is there this change, this blessed change, from dead
works to serve the living and true God? Oh then, will not the language
of thine heart be like Jesus, and his church of old? "I will greatly
rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: for he hath
clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the
robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments,
and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels."</p>

3—Evening—Zechariah 9:1</h3>
<p>"The eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the
Lord."—Zech. ix. 1.</p>
<p>Precious Jesus! when shall this blessed scripture be accomplished?
"The eyes of man!" What man? Surely as the church's glorious head, and
as her glorious representative, the eyes of our Lord Jesus himself were
always from everlasting directed to Jehovah his Father. But secondarily,
and subordinately, the eyes of thy redeemed, blessed Jesus, the eyes of
man, the eyes of every man, must ultimately, as the tribes of Israel, be
all toward thee for salvation. Thou indeed hast said, "Look unto me, and
be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none
else," Isa. xlv. 22. Paul, my soul! this evening, over this view of thy
Jesus, for it is a very blessed one, and see what improvements under
divine teaching, thou canst draw from it. It is said, that as one of the
tribes, yea, all the tribes of Israel, every eye shall be upon Jesus.
And how suitable is it that it should be so! Is not God the Father
unceasingly beholding his dear Son in his engagements, as the Mediator
and Surety of his church and people? Oh! who shall be competent to
describe with what complacency and delight he beholds him in his
glorious person, as the God-man, the Glory-man; and in all his offices,
characters, and relations? Somewhat of this we may gather from what
Jesus hath himself said concerning the Father's love for his
undertaking, and accomplishing redemption by his blood. "Therefore
(saith our Jesus) doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I might take it again," John x. 17. But the full apprehension of
the love of the Father on this one account, cannot perhaps be brought
within the capacity of the human mind. But if God the Father loves Jesus
as Mediator, and for his undertaking, and is unceasingly beholding him
with rapture on this account, it may serve at least to teach thee, my
soul, how exceedingly it becomes thee to look to Jesus for the same, and
that thine eyes, as the eyes of all the tribes of Israel, should be
towards the Lord. Dearest Lord Jesus! let mine eyes, mine heart, my
whole soul be fixed on thee, until every affection be going out in
desires after thee. I would trace thee, as the whole testament saints,
who saw thy day" afar off, rejoiced, and were glad." I would behold thee
as new testament believers, who are looking to thee, and "are
enlightened, and their faces are not ashamed." I would see thee with the
first dawn of the morning; yea, before the morning light, and" until the
day break, and the shadows flee away;" and until my beloved come to me"
as a roe, or a young hart, upon the mountains of, Bether!" Yes, precious
Lord Jesus! I would be sending the earnest longings of my soul through
the windows of the eye after thee, and never give rest to my eyes, nor
slumber to my eyelids, until that blessed hour arrive, when no medium
shall intervene to prevent the full enjoyment of my soul in thee; and
when a body of sin and death shall no longer weary my soul in her
enjoyment of thee; but I shall then see Jesus as he is, and never more
lose sight of his lovely person, but live in his presence, and Jesus in
mine, for evermore.</p>

<p>The dying patriarch Jacob, under the influence of the prophetic
spirit, pointed to the seed of Naphtali as a hind let loose. But it is
the church which points to Jesus as the hind of the morning; for he is,
indeed, the loving hind, and the pleasant roe. It is sweet and
profitable to observe in what a variety of methods the Holy Ghost hath
been pleased to give sketches of Jesus. My soul, look at Jesus for thy
present meditation as the hind of the morning. Was he not, from the very
morning of eternity, marked under this lovely character? Did not the
church speak of him, and desire his appearance, under this same
character, when she begged of him, that until the shadows of Jewish
ordinances were passed away, and the day of gospel light should break in
upon her, that her beloved would be like a young hart, or the roe, upon
the mountains of Bether? And was not Jesus, indeed, when he did appear,
truly as the hind which the dogs that compassed him about, and the
assembly of the wicked inclosed? Did he not say, in those unequalled
moments of suffering," Save me from the lion's mouth, for thou hast
heard me from the horns of the unicorn?" Yes, precious Jesus, thou art,
indeed, the hind of the morning! In the morning of our salvation, thou
camest over the hills and mountains of our sinful nature, with the
swiftness of the hind, and the loveliness and gentleness of the roe, to
expose thyself to the serpent, and the whole host of foes, for the
deliverance of thy people. And, having trod upon the lion, and the
adder, and the young lion, and the dragon, trampled under thy feet by
thy death, thou "didst overcome death, and him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil; and hast delivered them, who, through fear of
death, were all their life-time subject to bondage." And now, precious
Lord! thou art, as the hind slain, the food of the souls of thy redeemed
by faith, until faith itself is done away in sight, and hope swallowed
up in absolute fruition. Oh let the language of my heart daily, hourly,
correspond to the church of old; and, during the shadows of ordinances,
and all the dark clouds of unbelief and temptations with which I am here
exercised, let me still, by faith, behold thee as the hind of the
morning fleeing swiftly to my assistance, hearing and answering my
prayers, leaping over all the mountains of distance which sin and
unworthiness would throw up between thee and my soul, opposing all my
enemies, and beating them under my feet that would keep me from thee;
until that day, that glorious everlasting day which will have no night,
shall break in upon my soul, and thou wilt then appear, to my unceasing,
uninterrupted joy, the hind, indeed, of the morning. "Make haste, my
beloved, and be thou like unto a roe, or to a young hart, upon the
mountains of spices."</p>

6:12</h3>
<p>"And continued all night in prayer to God."—Luke vi. 12.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! contemplate thy Lord in the view here
represented of him. "Jesus continued all night in prayer to God." But
did Christ need to use prayer? Yes, as Christ, the sent, the anointed,
the servant of Jehovah, when he voluntarily stood up as the surety of
his people, at the call of God the Father. But as God, "one with the
Father, over all, God blessed for ever," he prayed not; for all divine
perfections were his in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
eternally, essentially, and underived. But, my soul, as thy
representative, Jesus needed the use of prayer, and hath both endeared
it, and recommended it by his bright example. And observe the fervency
and earnestness of his prayers, by the length of time. For whereas one
short hour is found long by thee, (yea, sometimes in that hour, what
coldness and deadness creep in!)thy Redeemer "continued all night in
prayer." And what were the subjects of his prayer, but the salvation of
his people? He needed no prayer for himself, had not his love to us, and
zeal for his Father's glory, prompted his infinite mind to undertake our
redemption. But when the Son of God became man for us, to make us sons
of God, then our safety, peace, and welfare, both for this life and that
which is to come, occupied his divine mind, and led him out "all night
in prayer to God!" What an illustrious proof hath Jesus given of this in
his farewell prayer, the night preceding his sufferings and death! As a
dying father in the midst of his family, behold how he commended his
whole household to God. "Keep, holy Father, (said he) through thine own
name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are."
My soul! often let thy thoughts revolve on this; and in thy cold and
languid moments in prayer contemplate how Jesus was engaged for thee and
thy salvation. The sun witnessed to the diligence of his labours by day,
and the stars in their courses testified of his earnestness in prayer by
night. And what is it now, in his glorious office as Intercessor, but
the all-prevailing and unwearied exercises of the same, only with this
difference: in his exalted state, his addresses are not by way of prayer
or petition, as when upon earth; for all the high offices of his
everlasting priesthood and sacrifice are carried on by his" appearing in
the presence of God for us." He appears in a vesture dipped in blood,
and as a Lamb which hath been slain. And his blood is said to be "a
speaking blood;" for it speaketh to God for us, on the ground of his
merit, and it speaketh </span><span class="c6">from</span><span
class="c5"> God to us, on the account of God's covenant grace and mercy
in Christ. Ponder well, my soul, these things;and in the contemplation
of thy Jesus, never lose sight of the everlasting and eternal efficacy
of his blood and righteousness; nor of thy interest in both. And when at
any time, thy poor, polluted, cold, and lifeless prayers find no
ascension, no strength nor energy, direct one look, with faith, to the
Lamb that is in the midst of the throne. Behold him, whom the Father
heareth alway; and call to remembrance, that it is the efficacy of his
merits and intercession which is the sole cause of thine acceptance
before God and the Father, and not thy earnestness, or the length of thy
prayers. Precious Jesus! help me thus stedfastly and steadily to behold
thee in thy holy vestments of the everlasting priesthood of Melchisedec;
and then shall I be assured that neither my poor person, nor poor
prayers, will ever be forgotten before God.</span></p>

14:10</h3>
<p>"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
me?"—John xiv. 10.</p>
<p>My soul, thou wilt never sufficiently contemplate this blessed
oneness between the Father and the Son, in the great work and glory of
redemption. Pause this morning, and observe for the confirmation of thy
faith, that as Jesus is one with the Father in all the essence and
attributes of the Godhead, so God the Father is one with Jesus. in all
the offices of redemption. God was in Christ's human nature; for he is
said to have been "God manifest in the flesh." God was in every name of
Christ, every work of Christ, every word of Christ, every office of
Christ, every attribute of Christ. And hence, in seeing Christ, we truly
see God; in all his grace, mercy, love, salvation, and every blessing
connected with our present, future, eternal happiness. And what a sweet
thought is that, my soul, for thee to dwell upon; that as the Father is
in Jesus, and in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, so,
in consequence, there is a fulness of grace and a fulness of glory in
Jesus to give out a supply here of the one, and hereafter of the other,
to satisfy the most capacious desires of the souls of his redeemed to
all eternity. For the human nature being personally united to the
God-head in the person of the Lord Jesus, there must be this fulness
everlastingly dwelling. There may be, and for certain purposes sometimes
there are, great gifts and graces of the Spirit poured out upon the
Lord's servants; but never could the Godhead be found in any but Jesus.
"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself." Pause once more,
my soul, and ask thyself, hast thou Christ? Then hast thou God the
Father in him. Where Christ is, God the Father is; and where Christ is
not, there God is not. See then, my soul, that? this is the standard to
ascertain the reality of thy case as it appears before God. Hast thou
Jesus for thy portion? Then the Father is in him. Dost thou love Jesus?
Then must thou love the Father in him. Dost thou seek Jesus? Then art
thou seeking the Father in him. Oh for grace to discover our true
interest in all the Father's covenant engagements, and promises, from
this very source: that this everlasting oneness between the Father and
Son infallibly secures to his people all the blessings of redemption,
for in seeing the Son, we literally and truly see the Father, and
glorify the Father in Jesus. Amen.</p>

13:12</h3>
<p>"And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."—Luke xiii. 12.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! sit down this evening, and let the case of
this poor woman open to thy view some sweet subjects of instruction and
encouragement. Who knows, but that God the Holy Ghost may graciously
make thy meditation on it blessed, in Jesus? The evangelist gives a
short but interesting history of her. She was a daughter of Abraham; and
yet Satan had bound her; and that not for a little space, but for a very
long time, even to </span><span class="c6">eighteen years.</span><span
class="c5"> Hence learn, that they who are </span><span
class="c6">within</span><span class="c5"> the covenant, are not
</span><span class="c6">without</span><span class="c5"> affliction; nay,
they become the very grudge and hatred of Satan, on that account; and
shall assuredly be made sensible of his enmity. Do not overlook this
part of the poor woman's memoir. It forms a distinguishing feature in
the children of the kingdom. Jesus himself hath said, "Because ye are
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
world hateth you." John xv. 19. And as to the length of time in which
Satan had harassed her, no doubt, there was much mercy mingled with the
exercise. Jesus knew all; yea, permitted all, and sanctified all. It
were devoutly to be wished, that all the Lord's afflicted ones would
ever keep this conviction uppermost in their minds. I have often
thought, that we should lose some of our highest enjoyments, if the Lord
did not afford occasion for the enemy to make use of some of his deepest
cruel ties. A child of God can never be a loser by the greatest
exercises, while Jesus stands by, regulates, restrains, and ultimately
blesseth all. The devil, as in the case of this poor woman, meant
nothing but evil; but see, my soul, how Jesus at length overruled it for
good. And if the sorrow be lengthened, to </span><span
class="c6">eighteen</span><span class="c5"> or even </span><span
class="c6">eight and thirty</span><span class="c5"> years, as to the man
at the pool of Bethesda, yet, if the issue be glorious, it is the end
that crowns the action; and in the mean time, the Lord can, and will
minister </span><span class="c6">eighteen thousand</span><span
class="c5"> consolations, to bear his children up under them, and to
make them "more than conquerors," through his grace supporting them. He
can, like another Samson, make "meat come forth from the eater; and out
of the strong, bring forth sweetness." How often have I seen a child of
God triumphing in weakness, when the power of Jesus hath been resting
upon him! Yea, the very tear, which hath been standing in the eye from
the pain of body, hath looked like a pearl for beauty, from the
spiritual enjoyments of the soul.—But let me take another view of this
poor exercised daughter of Abraham. Though bowed together by reason of
this spirit of infirmity, so as in no wise to be able to lift up
herself, yet do not fail to remark, my soul, that she did not absent
herself from the house of prayer. What multitudes are there who plead
sickness, yea, trifling sickness, to justify their absence from the
house of God! And who shall say what blessings may be lost upon those
occasions? Had Thomas not withdrawn himself from the meeting of the
disciples, at that memorable season when Jesus came to bless them, he
would have been spared the dreadful mortification that followed. Had
this poor woman not been in the synagogue when Jesus visited it, who
shall say how long might the blessing she then found have been withheld,
or when might another opportunity have offered? And it doth not appear
that this poor woman's attendance on worship was with the most distant
view of getting relief to her body, but for the care of the soul She was
indeed a daughter of Abraham, and as such, regarded "the one thing
needful." She had at least learned the spiritual truth of that blessed
saying of Jesus, whether or not she had heard the Lord's sermon on the
mount, and was brought into the practice of it: "Seek ye first the
kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you." When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
her, " Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity!" It doth not appear
that she made any application to Jesus to be healed. Sweet thought! "If
we love him, it is because he first loved us." Gracious as the Lord is
to the cries of his afflicted, he doth not always wait for their
petitions. It is his love, not </span><span class="c6">our</span><span
class="c5"> prayers; his </span><span class="c6">free</span><span
class="c5"> grace, not our </span><span
class="c6">constrained</span><span class="c5"> necessities, that becomes
the rule for Jesus bestowing mercy. Oh! thou dear Lord! art thou not now
in the assemblies of thy people? and dost thou not seek and search out
the poor of thy fold, wheresoever they have been scattered "in the
cloudy and dark day?" Ezek. xxxiv. 11, 12. Pause, my soul, over this
delightful view of thy Jesus, in his grace, to this daughter of Abraham;
and gather from it sweet instruction in all the remaining infirmities
under which thou art frequently bowed together, and from which, in
thyself, or thine own strength, thou art no more able to lift up
thyself, than this woman, of the stock of Abraham. Learn from this
relation where, and in whom alone, thy strength is found. Oh! for grace
to live under the constant enjoyment of strength in Jesus, and to say
with that exercised servant of old: "I can do nothing of myself; but I
can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me." And should the
Lord, in his providence, cause these lines to meet the eye of any son or
daughter of Abraham, who is still under the same spirit of infirmity, of
a natural state in which they were born, I would say, do as this poor
woman did, diligently attend the means of grace, and let nothing of soul
or body hinder a constant waiting upon the Lord; and, depend upon it,
Jesus will be there, and will speak personally to your case and
circumstances, and say, "Thou art loosed from thine
infirmity!"</span></p>

6—Morning—Genesis 45:4</h3>
<p>"And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into
Egypt."—Gen. xlv. 4.</p>
<p>What an interview was this, in the first manifestation the governor
of Egypt made of himself to his brethren! We are told that he wept
aloud. His bowels yearned over them. He had long smothered in his own
bosom those he now manifests himself to every poor sinner, whom, by his
grace, he makes partaker in the first resurrection on whom the second
death hath no power? I am Jesus, your brother, saith that adored Lord;
but he doth not add, whom ye sold for worse than a slave. There is no
upbraiding, nothing of our baseness and sins. And yet we have all not
only sold him, but by our transgressions crucified him. What a beautiful
feature this is in the Redeemer; and how much even the love of Joseph
falls short of Jesus! And what endears it still more, is the peculiar
attention the Redeemer manifesteth upon the occasion. If there be one of
his brethren more distressed and discouraged by reason of sin than
another, to him Jesus directs his manifestation more immediately.
Witness the case of Peter after his fall. Jesus will have the account of
his resurrection not only communicated to all, but Peter is mentioned by
name. "Go, tell his disciples, and Peter." As if knowing the apostle
might fear that. having denied Jesus, he might justly be denied by him
No, saith Jesus, let Peter be particularly told the joyful news, to make
his heart glad. And dost thou, dearest Lord, speak to my soul? Dost thou
say to me, I am your brother? Art thou not ashamed to call such sinners
brethren? Oh thou unequalled pattern of unexampled love! add one mercy
more to the vast. account, and let a portion of it kindle a flame of
love in my soul. I have, indeed, sold them for a slave; nailed thee, by
my sins, to the cross, and put thee to an open shame. But since thou
hast redeemed me by thy blood, and bought the pardon of my sins so dear;
and now, by thy triumph over death, art become the first-born among many
brethren, and exalted as a Prince and a Saviour to give blessings
infinitely superior to those Joseph was exalted to bestow on his
brethren; behold, Lord, to thee do I come: manifest thyself still the
forgiving brother, and supply all thy wants. Yes, blessed Jesus! thou
art he whom thy brethren shall praise; and all thy Father's children
shall fall down before thee.</p>

6—Evening—Deuteronomy 34:1</h3>
<p>"The top of Pisgah."—Deut. xxxiv. 1.</p>
<p>There is somewhat truly interesting in this account of Pisgah, to
which Moses ascended before his death. The relation, no doubt, was
intended to convey seasonable instruction, of a spiritual nature, to all
true believers in Christ, in their Pisgah contemplations of the promised
land. My soul! sit down this evening, and see what, under divine
teaching, thou canst make of it. Probably thy Lord, thy Jesus, may grant
to thy faith, sights yet more glorious than even Moses beheld in open
vision, when he went up to Mount Nebo. "The top of Pisgah" afforded to
the man of God, a beautiful prospect of Canaan; and as we are told, that
"his natural force was not abated, neither his eye become dim;" he might
possibly view the boundaries of Israel's dominions; which, in point of
extent, reached but little more than fifty miles in one direction, and
about three times that length in another. Indeed, we are informed, that
"the Lord shewed him all the land;" and the same power which gave him
the prospect, would doubtlessly give him a suited strength of vision for
the purpose. But what, my soul, are thy views on Pisgah's heights? The
utmost extent of the imagination cannot be sufficient to take in what is
opened before thee, of that "length and depth, and breadth and height,
of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge!" And if he, who led
Moses to the top of Pisgah, go with thee; if the same Lord that shewed
him all the land, shew thee also "the glories to be revealed :" think
what blessings will pour in upon thee, of "joy unspeakable and full of
glory." It is true, thy Pisgah views are in the distant means of grace,
and the ordinances of worship; where, very frequently, clouds arise, and
darken thy prospect. Nevertheless the word of God opens a true map of
that Judea, which is above, and which is "the glory of all lands;" and
God the Holy Ghost can, and will give the seeing eye to see, and the
awakened heart "to believe, the glorious things which are spoken of the
city of God." And if Moses, from the first moment that the Lord spake to
him from the bush, when the visions of God began, had been accustomed to
contemplate in every thing the view of Jesus; and, like the other
patriarchs, had seen his day afar off, so as to rejoice and be glad;
surely, since the Lord first called thee by his grace, and was pleased
to reveal his Son in thee, thou hast had increasing desires after Jesus,
and increasing knowledge of, and communion with Jesus; and therefore on
Pisgah's top, in thy evening meditation, thou mayest find sweet
anticipations of the glories of that kingdom above, which, ere long,
thou hopest to enter into the full enjoyment of, amidst the heirs of
God, and the joint heirs with Christ. One sweet thought more, the top of
Pisgah opens to the mind, in beholding the man of God going up to it: I
mean in that he went alone, the divine presence only being with him.
Here indeed is the very life of communion. The blessings Jesus imparts,
in Pisgah views, to his redeemed, are all personal, and alone. They are
joys with which a stranger cannot intermeddle. The white stone, and the
new name, and the hidden manna, which Jesus gives, are all in secret:
"no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth," Rev. ii. 17. My soul! art
thou acquainted with these things? Are these among the privileges of the
true believer; and dost thou hope, after a few more revolving suns have
finished their daily course, and the shades of night are done away, to
realize these glories, and enter upon the everlasting possession of
them?—Get up then, by faith, in thy evening meditations; yea, hear Jesus
calling thee by name, as he did Moses, and saying, get thee up into this
mountain, Abarim, and behold the land which I have taken possession of
for Israel! Oh! for grace and faith in lively exercise, to look olden
"within the veil, whither our glorious forerunner is for us entered,"
and there behold Jesus on his throne, and speaking in the same precious
words, as to the church of old:" To him that overcometh, will I grant to
sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am sat down with
my Father in his throne," Rev iii. 21. And while these soul-ravishing
triumphs of faith are upon the mind, with all the warmth of holy joy,
from Pisgah's heights, surely, like Simeon, the soul will then cry out
in the same language as he did, when he caught Jesus in his arms: "Lord,
let thy servant now depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine
eyes have seen thy salvation."</p>

7—Morning—Hosea 14:7</h3>
<p>"They shall revive as the corn."—Hosea xiv. 7.</p>
<p>Sweet promise to comfort a soul like mine, under so many and such
frequent languishing graces! How often hath it appeared to my view as if
the gracious seed had perished! It was small, indeed, in its first
beginning, like the grain of mustard seed; and no sooner had it
appeared, than I perceived it almost choked with the tares of
corruption, unbelief, and Satan's rubbish. I was soon led to suspect
God's work upon my soul. Surely, I said, this is not grace. Presently I
could see no more of it. I was ignorant that by thus dying to self, the
Holy Ghost was opening to my view the only living in Jesus. In a moment
unlooked for, it revived as the corn. Ah, from whence is the source? Not
from self, not from labours, not from exertions: can dead roots live?
The Holy Ghost taught me this must be Jesus. Your life, he said, is hid
with Christ in God. Here are the springs of grace: here, from hence,
flow the streams of that river which make glad the city of God. Here
then is faith's view of God's glory in Christ. Here is the promise.
"They shall revive as the corn." And thus it is fulfilled. "In me,"
saith that precious Redeemer, "is thy fruit found." Mark this down, my
soul. Both root and fruit are in one and the same, even Jesus. Spiritual
attainments are in Jesus, not in the greenest buddings or fairest
blossoms of our own labours. Live then, my soul, wholly upon Jesus, and
then thou wilt revive as the corn. Suppose it trodden down; suppose the
tares of the wicked rise to oppose it, yet if Jesus be the root, and the
springs of grace in him flow, as they cannot but flow, to keep alive all
the branches in him, there shall be, there must be at last, a glorious
harvest. Oh what a volume doth the soul sometimes read at once in that
short promise," Because I live, ye shall live also." Hail, hail, thou
glorious root out of a dry ground; thou wilt send forth the golden ears
for thine own garner. Thou wilt weed out every thing that annoys. Thou
wilt water, and by the sweet influences of thy blood, thy word, and
Spirit, thou wilt shine upon the standing corn. And when, by all thy
gracious husbandry, for the whole work and glory is thine, thou hast
caused the plentiful crop to hang down their heads in all the humbleness
of self-abasement, as the token of ripeness; thou wilt command thine
angel to put in the sickle of death, and take home every stalk and every
grain of the precious seed to thy garner in heaven.</p>

7—Evening—Revelation 2:10</h3>
<p>"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil
shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give
thee a crown of life."—Rev, ii. 10.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! thy last evening meditation, by faith, was
on Pisgah's top. This evening, do thou attend to what thy Saviour speaks
in this scripture of the prospect of a prison. This forms the state and
condition of the believer. The transition he is sometimes, and suddenly,
called to make, is from the house of feasting to the house of mourning.
He is here but in a wilderness at the best; and whatever accommodations
he meets with by the way, the apartments of joy and sorrow are both
under the same roof, and very often it is but a step from one to the
other: yea, sometimes, and not unfrequently, when Jesus hath been
feasting with his people, and they with him, before the cloth hath been
taken away, and the blessing offered up, a reverse of circumstances hath
followed.—But what saith thy Lord in this sweet scripture, (for it is a
sweet one, if well considered)? "Fear none of those things which thou
shalt suffer." There is a fear which belongs to our very nature, and
impossible wholly to be free from it; it is indeed part of ourselves. No
creature of God but one, and that is the Leviathan, that we read of, is
wholly free from it, Job. xli. 33. The blessed Jesus himself, when
assuming our nature, condescended to take all the sinless infirmities of
our nature, and therefore was subject in some degree to it; for we are
told, that "he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh," Rom. viii. 3.
Hence we read, that his holy soul, when in the garden, was "sore
troubled, sore amazed, and very heavy." Listen, my soul, to these
complaints of thy Redeemer! .And when at any time fear ariseth within at
the conflicts of Satan, recollect how Jesus felt during his unequalled
agony. One look, by faith, directed to him, as in the garden, will quiet
all. "Having himself suffered, being tempted, he knows how to succour
them that are tempted." But, besides this </span><span
class="c6">natural</span><span class="c5"> fear, to which our nature is
subject, there is a </span><span class="c6">sinful</span><span
class="c5"> fear, which unbelief, doubt, and distrust too often bring
into the soul. And it is this, if I mistake not, to which Jesus hath
respect in his precept before us. All hell is up in arms, to harass and
distress a child of God; and if the devil cannot deprive the believer of
his heavenly crown, he will rob him as much as possible of his earthly
comfort. Mark, then, my soul, what thy Jesus here proposeth for relief.
The devil would cast thee into </span><span class="c6">hell</span><span
class="c5">, if he could, but his rage can reach no farther than to a
</span><span class="c6">prison.</span><span class="c5"> He would cast
the </span><span class="c6">whole church,</span><span class="c5"> if he
could, into it; but it shall be only </span><span
class="c6">some</span><span class="c5"> of the church. He would cause
the confinement, if he could, to be </span><span class="c6">for
ever;</span><span class="c5"> but Jesus saith, it shall only be for
</span><span class="c6">ten</span><span class="c5"> days. And the Holy
Ghost hath caused it to be left on record, as a thing much to be
observed, that when the church was in Egypt, and Pharaoh would have kept
the people in vassalage for ever; yet when the Lord's time before
appointed was arrived, "the self-same night, the Lord brought them forth
with their armies," Exod. xii. 41, 42. Oh! it is a subject worthy to be
kept in everlasting remembrance, that "the Lord knoweth how to deliver
the godly out of temptation." Now, my soul, ponder well these things;
and connect with them what Jesus hath connected with the subject in that
sweet promise: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a
crown of life." Precious Jesus! put </span><span
class="c6">thy</span><span class="c5"> fear in me; and the fear of man,
which bringeth a snare, will depart. Be thou with me in trouble, and my
trouble will be turned into joy. Should a prison shut </span><span
class="c6">me in;</span><span class="c5"> no prison can shut
</span><span class="c6">thee out.</span><span class="c5"> Every
distressing thought will be hushed asleep, while, by faith, I hear my
Lord speaking to me in those soul-comforting words: "Fear thou not, for
I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen
thee, yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand
of my righteousness," Isa. xli. 10.</span></p>

<p>Pause my soul, over those divine, those glorious, those
soul-quickening, soul-reviving words of thy Almighty Redeemer! What man,
what prophet, what servant of the Lord, what angel but he that is the
angel of the covenant, one with the Father, over all, God, blessed for
ever, could assume such a language, and prove that assumption as Jesus
did, both by his own resurrection and that of Lazarus? And mark, my
soul, the many precious things contained in this sweet scripture.
Observe the blessing itself, even resurrection and life. Observe the
source, the author, the fountain of it. Jesus, thy Jesus. Observe for
whom this stupendous mercy is designed, and to whom conveyed; namely,
the dead in trespasses and sins, and for the dying languishing frames of
believers. And lastly, observe how absolute the thing itself is; they
shall live. Oh precious words of a most precious Saviour! And may I not
say to thee, my soul, as Jesus did to Mary, after proclaiming himself
under this glorious distinction of character; "Believest thou this?"
Canst thou answer as she did, "Yea, Lord, I believe that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world?" This is a
blessed confession to witness before God. For if I believe that Jesus be
indeed the Christ of God, every other difficulty is removed to the firm
belief that, as the Father hath life in himself, even so hath the Son
life in himself, and whom he will he quickeneth. Witness then for me,
every looker on, angels and men, that my soul heartily, cordially, fully
subscribes to the same precious truth, and in the same language as Mary.
Yea, Lord, I would say to every word of thine concerning thy
sovereignty, grace, and love, as thou hast said it, so I accept it; in
the very words of thine I take it, and cry out, yea, Lord, even so be it
unto me according to thy word. And now, my soul, under all remaining
seasons of deadness, coldness, backslidings, wanderings, and the like,
never henceforth forget, from whom all revivals can only come. Never
look within for them; for there is no power of resurrection in thyself.
"Can these dry bones live?" Yes, if Jesus quickens. And is Jesus less
able to quicken thee than thy connexion with Adam to have killed thee?
Oh how plain is it, that the very wants of the soul correspond to the
very fulness of Jesus to answer them. And therefore, when the Lord Jesus
saith, "I am the resurrection and the life," he comes to seek employment
in this glorious character, to quicken the dead and revive the living.
Oh Lord, give me to hear thy blessed voice this day, and my soul shall
live, and live to praise thee.</p>

8—Evening—Genesis 5:99</h3>
<p>"And he called his name Noah, saying, this same shall comfort us
concerning our work, and toil of our hands, because of the ground which
the Lord our God hath cursed."—Gen. v. 99.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> I still think, and believe that I always shall
think, that holy men of old possessed great superiority of faith to new
testament believers, in the attention they paid to the choice of names
given to their children. Our choice, for the most part, is from caprice,
or respect to our relations or earthly connections; they had an eye to
heaven. Thus, in the instance before us, Lamech evidently called his
son, Noah, which signifies rest, in reference to "the rest which
remaineth for the people of God;" and, as such, had an eye to Christ,
the promised seed, in whom alone that rest was to be found. I do not
presume to suppose that Lamech thought this child to be himself the
promised seed, as our first mother Eve did at the birth of Cain, when
she said, "I have gotten a man," or, as it might be read, "the man, from
the Lord," Gen. iv. 1. No doubt she considered this, her first-born son,
to be </span><span class="c6">the very man,</span><span class="c5"> the
</span><span class="c6">Ishi</span><span class="c5"> promised: and
hence, when her second son was born, she called him Abel, which means
</span><span class="c6">vanity;</span><span class="c5"> thereby
intimating, what is indeed true, that every other man but the God-man is
but vanity. Poor woman! how sadly mistaken she found herself! But though
Lamech had not such high views of his son, as to suppose him the very
Christ; yet in calling him Noah, it should seem probable, that he
desired, in the remembrance of this child, to keep up an eye to Christ
in him as a </span><span class="c6">rest,</span><span class="c5"> and
his son as a </span><span class="c6">type</span><span class="c5"> of
Christ, which Noah eminently was. And indeed the latter part of Lamech's
observation seems to confirm it: "This same shall comfort us concerning
our work and toil, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed." It
would be a strange, not to say an unnatural thought in a tender parent,
to take comfort in the prospect of a son's arriving to manhood, to take
off all toil and labour from his parents, that they might enjoy ease;
which would be the case, had Lamech meant nothing more than the rest of
this mortal life. In this sense, indeed, what is the </span><span
class="c6">curse</span><span class="c5"> here spoken of, and how could
the labour of Noah take it away? But on the supposition that Lamech was
so well taught of God, as to be looking forward to the day of "Christ
afar off," and under the believing expectation of Christ's coming in the
fulness of time, who would take away the curse, by being made both "sin
and a curse" for his redeemed, he called his son Noah, that he might, as
often as he should look upon the child, remember Christ. There is
somewhat very sweet and striking in this circumstance, which may serve
to explain why the Holy Ghost hath thus caused it to be so particularly
recorded. My soul! gather a sweet improvement from this scripture, and
do not fail to observe how graciously God the Holy Ghost dealt with the
patriarchs, in causing, by so many ways, the one glorious event of Jesus
and his salvation to be kept alive, in ages so remote from the
accomplishment of redemption. And what hast thou. to comfort thyself
with, concerning thy work, and the toil of thine hands? What is thy
rest, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed? Hast thou thy
Noah, thy Jesus, who is thy hope, thy rest, thy righteousness? Precious,
precious Noah! I would look up to thee, my Lord Jesus, and say, Thou
hast comforted me, thou dost comfort me, under all the toil and sweat of
brow-in which I eat my daily bread! Thou hast taken away the curse of
the ground, and art indeed thyself the whole blessing of it. Thou,
blessed Jesus, art the rest, "wherewith the Lord causeth the weary to
rest; and thou art the refreshing!" Isaiah xxviii. 12. "Return then to
thy rest, (thy Noah) my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with
thee," Psalm cxvi. 7.</span></p>

10:33</h3>
<p>"A certain Samaritan."—Luke x. 33.</p>
<p>Look, my soul, beyond the letter of the parable, and see if thou
canst not instantly discover who it is that is here meant. Mark how he
is described: "A certain Samaritan." Not any indifferent undetermined
one among the whole mass of men called Samaritans, but an identical
certain one: and who but Jesus answers to this character? "Said we not
well, (said the Jews) that thou art a Samaritan?" Yes, truly, thus far
ye said right; for our Jesus is the true Samaritan, that came a blissful
stranger from his blessed abode, to deliver us from our lost estate, for
his mercy endureth for ever. And, my soul, observe how exactly
corresponding to all that is said of this certain Samaritan in the
parable, thy Jesus proves to have been. Our nature, universally
speaking, was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when it fell among
thieves, and when it was left more than half dead by the great enemy of
souls; for we had all miserably departed from the Lord, when Jesus came
from heaven to the Jericho of this world, to "seek and save that which
was lost." And what could the priest or levite do by law or sacrifice,
to help our ruined nature? But when Jesus came and bound up the wounds
which sin and Satan had made, by pouring in the balsam of his own
precious blood, then he proved himself to be this certain Samaritan; for
none but Jesus could have done this, since there is salvation in no
other; "neither is there any other name under heaven, given among men,
whereby we must be saved." And what is it now, but the same gracious
mercy carrying on the same blessed purpose in completing the perfect
recovery of our nature. It is Jesus, Samaritan-like, which hath brought
us to the inn of his church, hath appointed his servants and angels, who
are ministering spirits, to minister in all divine things to the heirs
of salvation. He hath commissioned the whole train of ordinances, and
providences, and promises, to minister to our good. His holy word, his
Holy Spirit, are unceasingly engaged to the same blessed end. And what
crowns all, and makes our state and circumstances most safe and blessed
indeed, is, that Jesus hath commanded all the remaining costs and
expences of our cure to be put down to his account. He saith himself to
me, a poor worthless sinner as I am, and to every individual of his
redeemed, "Whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
repay." And is it so, my soul? Is not the blessing too great to be
bestowed, and thou too worthless to receive it? Oh no! for it is Jesus
who promiseth: that is enough. Hail, then, thou certain Samaritan, thou
Almighty Traveller through our miserable world! Since the first day that
thou didst pass by, and didst behold me in my blood, cast out to perish,
and didst bid me live, how hath my soul hailed thee, and now and
unceasingly will hail thee, as my life, my hope, my joy, my portion for
ever!</p>

9—Evening—Exodus 23:9</h3>
<p>"Ye know the heart of a stranger."—Exod. xxiii. 9.</p>
<p>True, Lord, I do indeed! for I was once a stranger in a strange land,
even in the land of spiritual Egypt. My soul! wilt thou not find it
profitable to look back, and call to remembrance thy o original
nothingness; yea, worse than nothing, when Jesus passed by, and bade
thee live? It is among the gracious precepts of the Lord, "to look to
the rock whence thou wert hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence thou
wert digged," Isaiah li. 1. And never surely was mercy more seasonable,
more abundant, more unexpected, unlooked for, and unmerited, than when
bestowed upon me! And doth my Lord say, "Ye know the heart of a
stranger? Oh! for grace rightly to apprehend that state out of which the
Lord brought me, when living as a stranger to the commonwealth of
Israel, "without hope, and without God in the world!" Thou knowest the
heart of a stranger, my soul; say then what it was. A stranger to any
knowledge of God the Father; ignorant, blind, senseless, unconscious of
sin, and unconscious of danger. And what a stranger to thee, thou
blessed Lord Jesus! I knew thee not, I loved thee not, I desired thee
not. Thy love, thy grace, thy pity, thy mercy, these were thoughts which
never entered my breast. Neither thy person, nor thy salvation, the
merits of thy blood, nor of thy righteousness, were ever in my view or
regard; yea, contempt of thee, and of thy people, thy sabbaths, thy word
and ordinances, would have been more the pursuit of my heart, than of
thy love. And so total a stranger was I to the idea of any saving change
to be wrought upon the heart by regeneration, that, concerning the
Eternal Spirit, and his divine agency upon the soul, never had I so much
as heard "whether there was any Holy Ghost!" My soul! was this indeed
thy case, as thou once didst stand before God? "Dead in trespasses and
sins;" and every moment exposed to the tremendous horrors of "the second
death," where thou wouldest have been a stranger to any lovely view of
God in Christ to all eternity. "Dost thou know the heart of a
stranger?"—Pause, and describe, if it be possible, what must be such a
state! And then look round, and behold the multitude of souls that are
so now; and say, dost thou not feel for the stranger, since thou wert
once a stranger in the land of Egypt? Oh! ye that are yet in nature's
darkness, fast bound in misery and iron; strangers and aliens; afar off,
and enemies to God by wicked works; "Oh! consider this, all ye that
forget God, lest he pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you!"
Lord! I desire to be humbled to the dust before thee, to ascribe all to
distinguishing grace, and everlastingly to be crying out, with the
astonishment of the apostle, "Lord, how is it that thou dost manifest
thyself to me, and not unto the world?"</p>

10—Morning—Mark 10:46</h3>
<p>"By the high-way side begging."—Mark x. 46.</p>
<p>My soul, learn a lesson from the beggar this morning. And Oh thou
blessed friend of beggars, do thou sweetly make the view gracious to my
soul. What was it led this poor man to the high-way side to seek alms?
Surely his poverty, wretchedness, and a sense of want. And art thou come
forth, my soul, from the same cause, and on the same errand? I presume
this poor creature came forth empty; for had he been full he would never
have come. And art thou so, my soul! for otherwise it is certain, they
that are full in themselves never seek Jesus. But amidst his want and
poverty, had this poor beggar hopes that the passers by would
commiserate his case and relieve him? Yes, no doubt: though some might
overlook and disregard him, all would not. But, my soul, thy case far
exceeds his. Though all disregard, Jesus will not: and thou art sure he
will pass by, and not only behold thy misery, but give thee needed
relief. Jesus, Master, have mercy upon me! Behold, I am come out this
morning as poor, as wretched, as empty, and as needy, as though I never
before had heard of thy dear name, or been living upon thy fulness. But
thou knowest that I cannot live upon the alms of yesterday, no more than
my body can keep in health from the food received in the many days that
are past, without a new supply, Lord, I know that I am thine, and that
thou art mine. I therefore come to thee for a suited supply; and surely,
thou wilt not send me empty away. Indeed, Lord, I rejoice that I feel my
poverty; for I am thereby, as an empty vessel, better suited for
receiving of thy fulness. Give in, blessed Jesus, to my poor hungry
soul, and then I shall find cause to rejoice that my emptiness and
beggary constrained me to seek thee; and that my need afforded an
opportunity for the display of thy grace. Yes, yes, blessed Lord, I am
not only content to be poor and to be needy, but to be nothing, to be
worse than nothing, so that if thereby my blessed Jesus gets glory in
the manifestation of his love and the giving out of his riches, "I will
glory even in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
me." A beggar still I wish to be, and to lay at thy gate, if but to
glimpse at thy face, and to receive one token from thy fair hand.
Indeed, indeed, then am I most full, when most empty, to be filled with
Jesus.</p>

10—Evening—Psalm 36:1</h3>
<p>"The transgressions of the wicked saith within my heart, that there
is no fear of God before his eyes."—Psalm xxxvi. 1.</p>
<p>How striking is this scripture, and how true! Yes, my soul; thou
needest not to look abroad into another's heart to see iniquity; for at
home, in thine own, a voice may be heard continually proclaiming it.
Renewed as thou art by grace, still thou feelest the workings of corrupt
nature: and though, as the apostle said, "with thy mind thou thyself
servest the law of God, yet with thy flesh the law of sin," Romans vii.
25. Pause over the solemn subject, and observe the working of a body of
sin and death, which is virtually all sin: "the carnal mind, (the
apostle saith) is enmity against God," Rom. viii. 7; not only an enemy,
but in enmity: so that the very nature is so; it is averse, naturally
averse to God, and is everlastingly rising in opposition to his holy
law. And this not only (as some have supposed, but all men, if they
would confess the truth, find to the contrary) before a work of grace
hath passed upon the soul, but after. Else wherefore doth the apostle
say, "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do
the things that ye would?" Gal. v. 17. He saith this to the regenerate,
to the church at large. And consequently this conflict is after grace
hath been manifested to the soul, and not before. A sinner unawakened
may indeed feel at times compunctions of conscience, and be alarmed at
what will be the consequence of his sins: but these are only the alarms
of conscience, not the workings of grace: and for the most part, these
alarms are but momentary. His affections are all on the side of sin. His
soul still remains "dead in trespasses and sins;" and he himself, like a
dead fish, swims down the stream of sin uninterrupted, without
resistance, and without concern. But when a child of God is renewed, and
the soul, that was before dead in trespasses and sins, becomes quickened
and regenerated; then it is that the conflict between the renewed part
in grace, and the unrenewed part in nature, begins, and never ends but
with life. My soul, hath the Lord taught thee this, made thee sensible
of it, and caused thee to groan under it? Dost thou find this heart of
thine rebelling against God; cold to divine things, but warm to natural
enjoyments; framing excuses to keep thee from sweet communion with the
Lord; and even in the moment of communion, running with a swarm of vain
thoughts, that "like the flies in the ointment of the apothecary causeth
it to send forth an ill savour?" Are these in thy daily, hourly,
experience? Why then the transgressions of the wicked saith within thine
heart, and not another's for thee, this solemn truth, there is no fear
of God at such seasons before the eyes of thy sinful body: "for by the
fear of the Lord, men depart from evil," Prov. vi. 6. Oh! precious,
precious Jesus! how increasingly dear, under this view of a nature so
totally corrupt, art thou to my poor soul! What but the eternal and
unceasing efficacy of thy blood and righteousness could give my soul the
smallest confidence, when I find that I still carry about with me such a
body of sin and death? Let those who know not the plague of their own
heart, talk of natural goodness; sure I am, there is nothing of the kind
in me. "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
thing." And were it not, dearest Lord, for the holiness of thy person,
blood, and righteousness, the very sins which mingle up with all I say
or do, yea, even in prayer, would seal my condemnation. Lamb of God! it
is the everlasting merit of thy atonement and intercession, thy blood
sprinkled upon my person and offering, by which alone the justice of God
is restrained and satisfied, and that it breaks not forth in devouring
fire, as upon the sacrifice of old, to consume me upon my very knees!
Blessed, blessed for ever be God for Jesus Christ!</p>

Samuel 16:11, 12</h3>
<p>"Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him. It
may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction; and that the Lord
will requite me good for his cursing this day."—2 Sam. xvi. 11, 12.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, see here a believer in his best frame. To
be sure, it is not always thus with a child of God; but it were to be
devoutly desired always thus to be. But while we admire the faith, let
us yet more admire and adore him, and his grace and mercy who gives it.
Oh what a blessed state it is to eye the hand of the Lord in every
thing. When Shimei thus cursed David, he passeth by the instrument, and
recognizeth the hand of the Lord in the appointment. "Let him alone, for
the Lord hath bidden him." Sin is at the bottom. The Lord doth not
correct for nought. How unjust soever on the part of man, it is both
just and right on the part of God. And observe, moreover, the comfort he
takes to himself out of it. If my God bid my enemy distress me, is it
not that my Almighty Friend may more sweetly comfort me? There is not
only a </span><span class="c6">may be,</span><span class="c5"> but a
certainty there </span><span class="c6">shall be,</span><span
class="c5"> in God's requiting evil with good to his people My soul,
never overlook this in any, and in all of thine exercises. Behold his
hand in it, be it what it may, and then thou wilt never faint under any
burden. Jesus not only looks on, but he it is that permits, that
appoint. Oh he is tender even in rebukes. By those means he makes his
children more like himself; and moreover, it is his gracious plan to
extract pleasure from pain, and by impoverishing the soul in self, and
in creature love, to turn curses into blessings, and convert loss into
gain. Doth the enemy curse you? Doth he come out against you? Oh then
depend upon it, Jesus is going to confer some special blessing upon you.
Thou art to be advanced to great honour, to be made more conformable to
his blessed image. Jesus is hereby giving you not only to believe in
him, but to suffer for his sake. Precious Lord! grant me then this grace
which thy servant David was enabled to exercise; and when the Shimeis of
the day come forth to curse, let them curse, so thou do but bless. And
Oh for sweet influences from thee, dearest Lord! "that I may know thee
and the power of thy resurrection, and the fellowship of thy sufferings,
being made conformable unto thy death."</span></p>

<p>"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from
which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."—Acts xii. 39.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> What can be more blessed to a poor conscious
sinner, such, my soul, as thou art from day to day, than the ministry of
his servant the apostle, in these gracious words. Sit down, this
evening, and, under his divine teaching, ponder them duly over. A poor
guilty sinner needs a rich and holy Saviour. That he cannot justify
himself in the sight of God, is most evident, for the least gust left
upon the conscience would condemn him for ever. He cannot be justified
by the deeds of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin, and in
the law we learn that we have all sinned, and come short of God's glory.
He cannot he justified by the offerings and sacrifices made under the
law of Moses; for how can the blood of bulls and of goats take away sin?
By what then, or by whom, my soul canst thou be justified? Hear what
this sweet scripture saith: "By him, that is, by the Lord Jesus Christ,
all that believe are justified from all things." Oh! how blessed is the
view! how complexly satisfying to the conscience, is the redemption by
Christ Jesus, "whom God hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith
in his blood?" And do not fail to observe the </span><span
class="c6">extensiveness</span><span class="c5"> of the blessing: it is
</span><span class="c6">all</span><span class="c5"> that believe, yea,
every individual believer; for the blood of Christ cleanseth from all
sin; and the righteousness of Chest, in a way of justification, is
</span><span class="c6">to all</span><span class="c5"> and </span><span
class="c6">upon all</span><span class="c5"> that </span><span
class="c6">believe, for there is no difference.</span><span class="c5">
And do not fail also to observe the </span><span
class="c6">equality</span><span class="c5"> of the mercy in
justification; it is to </span><span class="c6">all the
same.</span><span class="c5"> So that though believers differ in the
strength of their faith, and in the different degrees of that faith, yet
respecting their interest </span><span class="c6">in</span><span
class="c5"> Christ, and their union </span><span
class="c6">with</span><span class="c5"> Christ, the weakest, as well as
the strongest, is equally justified, and equally secure. And for this
plain reason: because the object of faith, which is Jews, is one and the
same, and justification is </span><span class="c6">in</span><span
class="c5"> and </span><span class="c6">by</span><span class="c5">
Christ, and doth not arise from the degree of apprehension the believer
hath of it. Sweet thought to a poor timid believer! Hence the
everlasting safety, both for acceptance in grace here, and the enjoyment
of glory hereafter, is to an the same. And however the Lord, in his
infinite wisdom, may think fit to appoint different paths for believers
departures out of life; though some, like the apostles, shall be called
to seal the testimony of their faith in Christ in blood, and wade
through this red sea (if it may so be called) to join the multitude on
the opposite shore, who are shouting the song of Moses and of the Lamb,
whilst others sweetly fall asleep in Jesus on their beds, quiet and
composed, amidst surrounding friends; yet, in the act of justification,
all are alike. Jesus, taketh the lambs of his fold in his arms, and they
shall lie in his bosom, while he leads the strong. In short, all that
are in union with Christ, do </span><span class="c6">live</span><span
class="c5"> in Christ, and shall </span><span class="c6">die</span><span
class="c5"> in Christ, whether they be little children, young men, or
fathers; for "by him all that believe are justified from all things,
from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses." See, my
soul, that thou hast this faith which is of the operation of the Spirit
of God, and then lie down this night, and every night, with the
composure of one that is in a state of justification with God, "having
peace with God, through Jesus Christ our Lord."</span></p>

<p>"Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not
faithless, but believing."—John xx. 27.</p>
<p>Was Jesus willing to have his wounds searched, than his unbelieving
disciple should go unconvinced? Look, then, my soul, at Jesus, and he
will grant thee a suitable testimony, to hush all thy remaining doubts,
if so be after such manifestations of grace as he hath shewn thee, there
be a single doubt left behind. Doth not Jesus, in effect, say, in every
renewed ordinance, reach hither thy finger, thrust in thine hand, and
the precious blood thou needest shall flow; for the fountain for sin,
for uncleanness, for unbelief, and, in short, for every necessity of my
people, is still open. Is not this the language of all? Doth unbelief
doubt the reality of the thing itself, like Thomas? Doth unbelief tempt
the soul to doubt the particular efficacy of it to special cases, such
as a man's own? Doth unbelief suggest the circumstances hopeless from
delay, from past neglect, from present unworthiness? In answer to all,
Jesus speaks, "reach hither thy finger;" and if a touch will not satisfy
thee, thrust thy hand deeply into my side. Here is enough to silence all
fears: why are those wounds still open? Wherefore did I appear to my
servant John as a lamb that had been slain, but to convince, by so
palpable a testimony, that I am the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever? Oh for grace to return the grateful answer to Jesus, "my Lord, and
my God!" My soul, now thou art commanded, this do. Put forth thine hand,
and leave every other consequence with Jesus. While Jesus thus gives
himself to thee, my soul, do thou make a complete surrender of thyself
to him; for this is the very exercise of faith that Jesus is come after,
and therefore let him not go away until he hath taken thine whole
affections with him, as thy Lord and thy God.</p>

<p>"For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord;
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end."—Jer.
xxix. 11.</p>
<p>My soul! thou art "looking for the mercy of thy Lord Jesus Christ
unto eternal life." This is thy one object, and that one object is
centered in Jesus. But in the view of this, thou art sadly put to it, at
times, by thwarting providences, that seem to come between It would be a
blessed help to thee, hadst thou grace always to keep in remembrance
what the Lord saith in this blessed scripture: "I know the thoughts that
I think towards you; thoughts of peace, and not of evil." And how truly
fulfilled are these things in the redemption by Jesus! In him the
foundation is laid for the accomplishment; and "He is of one mind, and
who can turn him?" Be the outward appearances of things what they may,
yet the Lord is everlastingly pursuing one and the same invariable plan
of mercy. His providences may vary, but his grace never can. It is the
deficiency of our faith, and not a defect in the covenant, which makes a
believing soul to stagger, and call in question divine faithfulness. [
said, saith the church, (at a time when the streams of that river which
makes glad the city of God, ran low,) "I said, my strength and my hope
is perished from the Lord." But how did the church correct herself soon
after! "The Lord is my portion," saith she; "therefore will I hope in
him." Lam. iii. 18—24. It is blessed to rest upon the Lord's own words,
and to give credit to what he hath promised, when, according to all
appearances of things, there seemeth an impossibility to the performance
of them. This indeed is faith, and faith in her best dress and
character. It is no longer faith, when the thing promised is come to
pass: this is not trusting God, but receiving payment from God. But when
God's thoughts towards us, find, through his grace in our hearts,
corresponding thoughts towards him, of his truth and faithfulness; then,
whatever happens by the way, the soul of the believer is kept in peace,
because he knows that he shall have an expected end of peace, and not of
evil. Oh! then for grace to be everlastingly hearing the Lord's voice in
all his dispensations. See to it, my soul, that under all trials, all
exercises, all difficulties, be they what they may; as there can be no
trial of which Jesus hath not the appointment, no exercise but what he
knows, no difficulty that can for a moment alter or interrupt his plan
of salvation; Oh! learn to lean upon him, and to leave all with him,
entertaining and cherishing the same good thoughts of him for ever! for
he it is that saith, "I know the thoughts that I think towards you;
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end."</p>

13—Morning—Ezekiel 9:2</h3>
<p>"And one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's
inkhorn by his side."—Ezek. ix. 2.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this scripture. Who could this one man be, but
Jesus, thy Mediator. Did not his garment of linen mark his
righteousness, and the inkhorn to write down his people, his pierced
side? Hath he not written in the book of life the names of all his
redeemed, that none of them may be lost when he cometh to make up his
jewels? And was it not with an eye to this the soldier pierced his side
when by his death he had obtained eternal redemption for them, that he
might with his precious blood mark his people, as a shepherd doth his
sheep? Yes, thou dear Redeemer! surely I behold thee sweetly set forth
in this scripture. Surely the Holy Ghost, who all along delighted to set
thee forth under various similitudes before the old church, hath
graciously represented thee here. Methinks I behold thee now coming
forth in the white garment of thy spotless righteousness, with thy
pierced side, to mark all thine, before the destroying angels go forth
to the everlasting destruction of unawakened, unregenerated sinners.
Methinks I hear thy blessed, gracious, compassionate voice, in the same
tender tone of words as thou once didst utter to thy servant John: "Him
that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he
shall go no more out. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and
the name of the city of my God: and I will write upon him my new name."
Oh Lamb of God, fulfil these blessed promises in my soul! Mark me as
thine, unto the day of redemption. Seal me as a signet in thine image,
and give me that new name which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
it. Then, amidst burning worlds, my soul will stand secure, being
justified in thy righteousness, and sprinkled with thy blood; and I
shall hear, with holy joy, that glorious, but awful voice, "come not
near any man upon whom is the mark."</p>

13—Evening—Song of Solomon 2:3</h3>
<p>"I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was
sweet to my taste."—Song ii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul! hear what the church saith concerning her Lord, in those
early and distant ages, before thy Redeemer became incarnate, and mark
the strength of her faith and love. Did old testament saints thus sit
down with a recumbency on the person, work, and finished salvation of
Jesus, as those determined to arise no more, when they beheld Christ
only through "the shadow of good things to come;" and shall not thy rest
in Christ, and thy enjoyment of Christ, be equal, and even greater than
their's? For shame, my soul! let it never be said, that their views of
Jesus, who was then yet to come, and had all the vast work of redemption
to perform, were as lively as thine, or their delight in those fruits of
his salvation, which they partook of by anticipation, sweeter to their
taste, than they are now enjoyed by thee. Thou hast lived to see the
whole completed, and canst, and dost look up, and behold thy Jesus
returned to glory, having" finished transgression, made an end of sin,"
and now for ever seated at the right hand of God. Oh, thou dear
Redeemer! give me to sit down under the sweet revelations of thy word,
and in the gospel ordinances of thy church, and here by faith realize
and substantiate all the blessings contained in the glories of thy
person, the infinite and eternal merit and worth of thy righteousness,
blood, and salvation; and have my whole soul, and body, and spirit,
continually feasted with the rich fellowship and communion which there
is to be enjoyed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ! And
surely, Lord, thou art all, and infinitely more than is here said of
thee by the church. Thou art a shade for protection from every thing
which can assault a poor weather-beaten soul, harassed by sin, by
sorrow, and temptation. Well might the prophet describe thee as "the man
that is as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest;
as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great rock in
a weary land;" Isa. xxxii. 2. I find thee necessary as an hiding-place
to shelter me from the wrath to come. I have sinned, and am justly
exposed to the wrath of God. I find the accusations of conscience, the
arrests of God's law, the temptations of Satan, the alarms of justice;
and, under all these, what but thy blood and righteousness can screen my
poor soul, or make me secure in an hour of visitation? But, sheltered by
thee, and justified by thy great salvation, I find every thing I need,
to protect and secure me from the storm, "when the blast of the terrible
ones is as a storm against the wall." But, my soul, this sweet scripture
doth not only set before thee thy God and Saviour as a shadow to sit
under for protection, but as affording fruit also, to refresh thee in
thy want of sustenance. Like some rich, luxuriant, and generous tree,
which not only shelters the traveller from the scorching heat, but holds
forth on its branches delicious fruit to regale and satisfy for food; so
Jesus, by his person, work, and righteousness, protects his people from
all evil; and by the fruits of his blood and redemption, supplies them
with all good. Yes! blessed, bountiful Lord, thou art here again all
these, and infinitely more; for the fruits of thy life, death,
resurrection, ascension, and glory, give to thy redeemed, mercy, pardon,
and peace, with all the fulness of covenant blessings in this life, and
everlasting happiness in the life to come. O Lord! grant me then, day by
day, and from night to morn, to sit down under thy shadow, that I may
"revive as the corn, and grow as the vine." Yea, Lord, [ would so sit
down, as one that had determined to rise no more; and having found thee,
and in thee all I need to bid adieu to all the world holds dear; and,
like Paul, "count all things else but dung and dross, that I might win
Christ, and be found in thee, the Lord my righteousness."</p>

14—Morning—Galatians 5:25</h3>
<p>"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."—Gal. v.
25.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, take this sweet scripture for thy motto,
not only this day, but every day; for every day's walk should be the
same with Jesus, by the Spirit. And surely, my soul, if Jesus really,
truly, dwells in thee, he will manifest that he is at home, by ruling in
thee. It is blessed, and gracious, and edifying, when out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, and like the spouse, the lips
drop as the honey-comb, sweetly of Jesus. But the life of Jesus in the
soul, consisteth not in talking only of Jesus, but walking in him, and
walking with him. But, my soul, how wilt thou accomplish these things,
carrying about with thee as thou dost daily, a body of sin and death?
There is but one plan, and that a simple plan, mortifying, indeed, to
the pride of human nature, but giving glory to Jesus. Art thou truly
content to be mortified, so that Jesus be glorified? If so, this is the
only way the apostle hath marked. They, and they only that live in the
Spirit, will walk in the Spirit. The same grace which teacheth thee
</span><span class="c6">of Jesus,</span><span class="c5"> must give to
thee power in Jesus. As long as Jesus is in view, looked to, and lived
upon, all the blessed effects of the grace from Jesus will follow, as
sure as the rays of light diffuse their brightness when the sun is
risen. If, my soul, thou goest forth in a firm dependance upon Jesus's
strength, that strength will be assuredly perfected in thy weakness; but
if Jesus be lost sight of, and a fancied strength in thyself supply the
place, this defect in faith will bring forth a defect in practice. My
soul, learn to exercise an holy jealousy over thyself; for after Jesus
is once truly known, all thy danger begins at this place; so that the
great secret is, to live out of self, upon his fulness; to do nothing
but in his strength; to propose nothing but for his glory; and in every
step you take in the whole walk of life, to make Jesus every thing, and
depend upon him in every thing; and this is the way to find both
security and comfort. Dear Lord, do thou enable a poor worm thus to
live, by living in thee; and then, sure I am I shall be happy, by
walking in thee.</span></p>

14—Evening—Psalm 105:25</h3>
<p>"He turned their heart to hate his people."—Psalm cv. 25.</p>
<p>Oh! precious scripture! what a blessed discovery is here made! Never
should I have known, never thought that the hand of my God was in a
dispensation like this. Henceforth, my soul, remember, when at any time
the world is oppressing thee, and opposing thee, yea, when even "thy
mother's children are angry with thee;" look deeper than the surface,
and behold both the Lord's wisdom, and the Lord's appointment in the
exercise. And dost thou ask wherefore the Lord should dispose the heart
of the believer's foes to hate his people? the answer is at hand: it is
to keep his people from "mingling with the heathen, and learning their
works." Nature cleaves to nature; and the dispositions of flesh and
blood are in all the same. If God, therefore, turn the hearts of those
we are too fond of, to treat us with unkindness, and reward our love
with hatred, this process will do more to separate the precious from the
vile, than all the Lord's precepts; yea, even more than a sense of our
own danger. How much disposed art thou, my soul, to seek the favour of
the world! how frequently dost thou study to conciliate the affections
of those who differ from thee in the great truths of God. Jesus, who
knows this, beholds it, and will not suffer it to be. He graciously
causeth some secret sorrow to spring out of this root. The heart we wish
to be particularly friendly, is led to manifest provoked unkindness; and
where we are looking for most pleasure, there we find most pain. And in
all this, Jesus's love and wisdom are at the foundation. No dispensation
would answer the purpose to correct our wayward choice but this; and it
is blessed to see how the Lord accomplisheth the secret purposes of his
will, by means so opposite to our calculation. Mark down this sweet
scripture for the special purpose of improvement, under exercises like
these. And when at any time the false reproaches of one, or the
unprovoked anger of another, in the carnal world, make thee sad,
recognize the hand of Jesus in the dispensation, and read this blessed
passage in proof; "He turned their heart to hate his people."</p>

15—Morning—Isaiah 62:3</h3>
<p>" Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a
royal diadem in the hand of thy God."—Isa. lxii. 3.</p>
<p>It is very easy to conceive how the Lord of Hosts in the day of
salvation becomes for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto
his people, as a prophet hath said, Isa. xxviii. 5. But that the church,
and every individual redeemed of the church, shall be the Lord's crown
and diadem. Oh, the wonders of grace! Pause, my soul, over the sweet
scripture, and take to thyself the blessedness of it. What a variety of
images and similitudes thy God hath made use of to manifest how highly
he prizeth his redeemed. "Yea, he loveth the people," said one of old;
"all his saints are in thy hand." He calleth them jewels, precious
stones, his treasure, his chosen, his inheritance, his portion, his
crown, his diadem. And what a thought is it for thee, my soul, to
meditate upon, that though in thyself thou art nothing, yet considered
in Jesus, thou art all this, and more; polished, made comely and
glorious, from the comeliness put upon thee and the glory of Jesus. See
then, my soul, the vast mercy in Jesus. A worthless worm made dear to
God! How infinitely precious and dear should God in Christ be to thee.
Let this encourage thee, then, at all times to come to him. Thou art
giving glory to thy God, when thou. comest to him, to give out of his
fulness to thee. Jesus wanteth needy creatures to be glorified upon, by
giving out of his abundance to their necessities; and the more he gives,
the more is he glorified. Mark that also, for thy greater encouragement
to come to him. The more thou art blessed in his fulness, the more
blessed he is in imparting it; so that while thou art his crown of
glory, he is glorified in thy redemption. And while thou crownest
Jesus's head, in ascribing all the glory of thy salvation unto him, he
condescends to make thee a crown of glory in his hand, as a token that
thou art his, both by purchase of his blood, the gift of his Father, and
the conquest of his grace. Hallelujah.</p>

15—Evening—John1:47</h3>
<p>" An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."—John i. 47.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> And what are we to understand by our Lord's
account, in this short but sweet history of Nathaniel, of an "Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile?" If, my soul, thou wilt do as thou art
directed, (1 Cor. ii. 13.) attend "to the words which the Holy Ghost
teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual," thou wilt soon
arrive at a proper apprehension of the Lord's account, of "an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile." It is our mercy that, on a point of so
much consequence, we are not left to mere conjecture; for the Holy Ghost
hath himself pointed out what it is to be without guile, in one of the
Psalms of David. (See Psalm xxxii.) And in his comment upon it by the
apostle, (Romans iv. 12.) he hath followed up the same doctrine more
fully; "Blessed (saith he) is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose
sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile." Now here observe, that
the blessedness here spoken of, is not said to be a man that
</span><span class="c6">hath no sin,</span><span class="c5"> neither
</span><span class="c6">had</span><span class="c5"> sin, but to whom the
Lord </span><span class="c6">imputeth it not.</span><span class="c5">
And wherefore is this blessedness? It is explained: because "his
transgression is forgiven, and his sin covered." And the Holy Ghost is
pleased, by his servant the apostle, to give a farther explanation, by
tracing it to its source, in the forgiveness of sins "by Jesus Christ."
And in the case of Abraham, the great father of the faithful, he most
clearly and fully proves the truth of this momentous doctrine: "Cometh
this blessedness then (saith he) upon the circumcision only, or upon the
uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham. How
was it then reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?
Not in circumcision; but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet
being uncircumcised." Now hence, my soul, thou mayest learn what it is
to have "no guile," and, by consequence thereof, to be an "Israelite
indeed." If thou wilt consult Abraham's history, thou wilt discover that
he was justified by faith: "he believed in the Lord, and it was counted
to him for righteousness;" and this was many a year before he was
circumcised; see Genesis xv. 6. Some have reckoned it full </span><span
class="c6">twenty years;</span><span class="c5"> very certain it is,
that it could not be less than </span><span class="c6">ten
years;</span><span class="c5"> see Gen. vii. And from the moment of his
justification by faith, Abraham might truly be said to be one "in whom
was no guile." Apply what is here said by the Holy Ghost of Abraham, to
the instance of Nathaniel, and of all the spiritual seed of Christ, and
the conclusion will be the same: this it is to be "an Israelite indeed,
in whom is no guile!" My soul! what sayest thou of thyself? Art thou "an
Israelite indeed?" Is thy guilt taken away by the blood of Christ?
Pause; and recollect what the scripture saith: "For he is not a Jew
which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward
in the flesh. But he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is
not of men, but of God," Rom. ii. 28, 29. "And if ye be Christ's, then
are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. iii.
29.</span></p>

16—Morning—Mark 5:18, 19</h3>
<p>"And he that had been possessed with the devil, prayed him that he
might be with him. Howbeit, Jesus suffered him not; but saith unto him,
Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath
done for thee."—Mark v. 18, 19.</p>
<p>Mark this, my soul, and especially when at any time thy Jesus is so
graciously revealing himself to thee, in a way of love, that thou art
longing to be absent from the body, that thou mayest be "present with
the Lord:" think then, of what Jesus said to this poor man. The thought
of being made instrumental in the hand of the Lord in calling sinners to
Jesus, made holy Paul willing to wait in a sinful world, and put off his
own happiness. Precious frame of mind! Paul knew also, that if the Lord
housed his children from the lion's den, and from the mountains of
leopards, as soon as he had brought them to the knowledge of himself,
then, in this case, Jesus would have no church in the wilderness. The
holy seed would not be found amidst the tares of the earth. Blessed
Lord! give grace to every exercised child of thine to think of this;
that when, under the various trials with which thy wisdom and love see
fit to try their graces, they long to be home with thee, and are sending
forth the. cry of the soul for dismission, they may hear thy voice
speaking, as to this poor man, "Go home to thy friends, and tell them
how great things the Lord hath done for thee." But pause, my soul—is
this thy case? Hath Jesus done great things for thee, and art thou
proclaiming it abroad to call others to partake? Suppose one from the
throng was to ask thee, "What is thy Beloved, more than another
beloved?" what would be thy answer? Wouldest thou say, how he hath blest
thee in health, or wealth, or worldly success, or prosperity; in
friends, and relations, and the like? And are these all the things, or
the chief of them, that thou couldest speak of? If so, what are these
more than carnal men can, and do speak of? The infidel, the Turk, the
pagan, can boast as much! But if thou canst say, 'Oh! "come hither and
hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what he hath done for
my soul!" I was once darkness, and am now light in the Lord. I was once
in Satan's chains, and Jesus hath set me free. I was once, like this
poor man, under the possession of sin and Satan; but now I sit down at
the feet of Jesus, to hear the gracious words which proceed out of his
mouth. Here, my soul, this is indeed to tell thy friends how great
things the Lord hath done for thee. Oh! for grace thus to proclaim his
adorable name while on earth, until Jesus comes to take me home to
himself, there to sound his praise before the whole redeemed church of
God for ever!</p>

16—Evening—Esther 4:16</h3>
<p>"So will I go unto the king, which is not according to the law; and
if I perish, I perish."—Esther iv. 16.</p>
<p>What a noble act of the soul is faith! Who, indeed, but the Lord
Jesus, can be the author or giver of it? Ponder it well, my soul, and
see if thou canst discover the smallest possible degree of it in thee.
To have the least portion of it is an evidence of an interest in Christ;
for it is said, that "as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed," Acts xiii. 48. And Oh! what an honour is it to give credit to
God the Father's testimony of his dear Son!—Sit down, my soul, this
evening, and pause over the subject. There are more difficulties to the
exercise of it than are generally considered. The case of Esther, in the
court of the Persian king, will serve, in some measure, to explain it.
By the law of Persia, every individual, whether man or woman, who
ventured into the inner court of the king's presence uncalled, was
condemned to death; neither was there any remission of the punishment,
unless the king held out to the offender the golden sceptre. The case,
however, for which Esther was constrained to go in, was of that nature,
that there remained no alternative, but to go or die. Contrary to the
known law of the realm, she therefore ventured, crying out as she went,
"If I perish, I perish." Now this is quite the state of the poor sinner.
The law of God for ever separates between a holy God and an unholy
sinner. "Thou canst not see my face and live." Nothing that is "unholy,
can stand in God's sight." These are the solemn declarations of the law
of heaven. God hath indeed reserved the grace of pardon, to whom he will
hold out the golden sceptre. But even this grace doth not reign but
through righteousness. The law admits of nothing by way of pardon, but
upon the ground of satisfaction. A righteousness every sinner must have
in himself, or in a Redeemer, or he will perish everlastingly. Hast thou
then, my soul, that faith, that trust, that sure dependence, upon the
Lord Jesus Christ, as to go in unto the King, which is not according to
law, but wholly on the blessed authority of the gospel, determined, like
Esther, to be saved by this grace of thy King and Saviour, or not at
all? Yes, Lord! I come. Precious Emanuel! wilt thou not hold forth the
golden sceptre of thy grace, and say to my soul, as thou didst to the
poor woman in the gospel, "Great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as
thou wilt?"</p>

<p>"I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me."—Psalm xl.
17.</p>
<p>Precious consideration, my soul! Under all thine exercises, the Lord,
thy Lord, thy Jesus, thinketh upon thee. Wherefore should I faint, then,
under any burden? Surely I may say, as Hagar did at the well, "Thou,
God, seest me." Surely I may give my God, my Saviour, this name, as she
did; for she said, "Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
Yes, however unconscious my poor heart is of the blessed truth, yet a
very blessed truth it is, while! am looking after Jesus, he is
beforehand, thinking and looking upon me. Precious Lamb of God! I will
remember my poverty no more: that is, I will remember it no more, but as
it is made the means in thy hand to make me sensible of my need and thy
fulness. Art thou thinking upon me? Do I hear thy gracious voice, saying
to me, "I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end?" Oh
then, herein I will rejoice! Poor and needy as I am, let me be more
poor, more needy, so but I see my fulness in Jesus. He is thinking of
me, providing for me, blessing me. I would not be full for the world, or
fancy myself so; for what room should I then have for Jesus? What it
will be in heaven, I know not, in the fulness of happiness that is
there, though that fulness can only be in and from Jesus; but here
below, a full state, or a supposed full state, would be a wretched
state. No, let me be poor and needy, empty and in want, wretched and
helpless in myself; for then I am sure my Jesus will be most precious.
Mark it down, then, my soul, this day, and wear it about thine heart as
a pleasing consideration—when thou feelest thy need and poverty most,
the Lord thy Jesus thinketh upon thee.</p>

17—Evening—Matthew 10:3</h3>
<p>"Matthew the publican."—Matt, x. 3.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> It ought not to be overlooked, in the account of
this apostle of Jesus, that in the list given by the other evangelists,
of our Lord's disciples, he is placed before Thomas; but in this, of his
own, he places Thomas first. And whereas, after his call to the
apostleship, the brethren, in making mention of him dropped his former
occupation of a </span><span class="c6">publican,</span><span
class="c5"> yet Matthew himself still preserves it. Grace always
humbles. The call of this man, the distinguishing nature of that grace,
the effects, and blessedness of it, open some sweet thoughts for
meditation, which, under divine teaching, cannot fall of being
profitable to the saint, and encouraging to the sinner: and it will be
well, my soul, for thee to exercise thine evening devotion upon it. He
was a </span><span class="c6">publican;</span><span class="c5"> that is,
a tax-gatherer for the Romans. Of such characters we cannot have a more
lively idea, than from what our Lord himself said of them. For when
Jesus, in his description of a sinner more than ordinarily to be
avoided, sets him forth as such, he said, "Let him be to thee as an
heathen man and a publican." Such was Matthew when called. And where was
he when called? Not in the synagogue, attending the means of grace, or
desiring to seek the Lord; but when seeking him not, yea, sitting at the
seat of custom, and fully engaged in his pursuit of worldly gain. Pause,
my soul, and mark the property of grace! Surely in this man's instance,
as well as in thousands of others, the Lord might say, "I am found of
them that sought me not!" And Oh! what a surprising, unexpected,
unlooked for call, was that of the Lord Jesus to Matthew! What a
powerful, gracious, saving, and effectual call was it! Precious
Redeemer! are we not authorized to consider all these, and other similar
points of view, as purposely intended to tell poor sinners, like
Matthew, that thy grace is not the effect of our merit, nor the result
of any man's worth? Surely, Lord, every poor sinner may from this learn,
that whatever best tends to magnify the riches of thy grace, must be in
the purposes of thy holy will and pleasure. Hence it is, that thou
makest thy grace to shine on such lost, ruined, and undone sinners as we
are. But, my soul, take another short view of this man, and thy
Saviour's grace towards him. When the Lord had called him by his grace,
he invited the Lord to his home: no sooner did Jesus open Matthew's
heart, than Matthew opened his house to receive Jesus. See to it, my
soul, that thou art daily manifesting the same proofs of </span><span
class="c6">thy</span><span class="c5"> calling. Oh! for grace to take
Jesus home to our hearts, to our houses, to our neighbours, to our
families, children, and servants, if we have any, and spread forth the
sweet savour of his name, and the efficacy of his blood and
righteousness, in every direction. Like the Psalmist, let our language
be, "O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell
you what he hath done for my soul!" </span></p>

<p>Do I not behold Jesus here pre-eminently set forth above his fellows?
Yes, dear Lord, thy people, planted by thy hand, do indeed flourish as a
flower of the field; but never any like thee. Indeed all their
loveliness, fragrancy, value, all are only so, as derived from thee.
Never did God our Father plant so lovely a flower, so sweet, so fragrant
a flower in the field of his garden, in the heavenly paradise, or the
earthly Eden, as when he planted thee. Sweet plant of renown! aid my
meditations this morning to contemplate thee under this interesting
view, as the flower of the field. And first, let me behold thee as truly
the flower of the field, because thou art altogether of God's right hand
planting, and not of man's. The flower of the field hath no father but
God, and no mother but the virgin earth. Precious Jesus! thou wert
conceived in thy human nature wholly by the overshadowing of God the
Spirit, when thou condescendest, for our salvation, to be born of the
virgin's womb. And let me look at thee, Oh Lord, under another beautiful
illustration of thy nature, as the flower of the field, when I consider
the humbleness and lowliness in which thou didst appear. Was there ever
a sweet flower of the field more hid, more obscured, and when brought
forward to view, less regarded, than Jesus, of whom it was truly said,
"He was despised and rejected of men; without form or comeliness, and
having no beauty that we should desire him?" And is there not another
thought which ariseth to the mind in the contemplation of Jesus as the
flower of the field? Yes, methinks I behold in the exposure of the
flower of the field to the merciless treading of the foot of the
passenger, and to the plucking up or destroying by wild beasts, a
striking representation of Jesus, who, in the days of his flesh, was
encompassed by beasts of prey, and trodden down of men. Alas, how many
even now in the present hour despise thy person, live regardless of thy
righteousness, have trodden under foot the Son of God, and count the
blood of the covenant an unholy thing. But, precious Jesus! give me to
behold thee as the sweet flower of the field, open to the view of every
traveller, and shedding the richness of thy fragrancy, under all the
influences of thy Spirit, both in the north wind, and the south wind of
thy power. Ye travellers to Zion, come, see this lovely flower in the
open field of his word, his church, his ordinances. Behold the freeness
of his bloom, his beauty, and odour. He sheds his influences, not in a
garden enclosed that ye cannot approach, but in the open field. Here he
stands, as the plant of renown, which God hath raised up. Oh come to him
as the balm of Gilead, and the Physician there, that the hurt of the
daughter of his people may be healed.</p>

Corinthians 11:3</h3>
<p>"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that
is in Christ."—2 Cor. xi. 3.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> And what is "the simplicity that is in Christ?" The
apostle answers this question in another part of his writings, when he
saith, "Christ is all, and in all." Now nothing can be more simple than
this: "Christ is all;" then it would be equal folly to seek for
happiness in any thing but in Christ. And" Christ is in all;" then it
would be equal folly to seek for happiness in any thing but in Christ.
So that if our minds are led away to seek a supply from any thing short
of Christ, this is the same temptation that the devil played off upon
our first parent, and succeeded. This indeed is the grand device of
Satan: it is the master-piece of his subtilty. This is what all carnal
unawakened men fall into: to fancy somewhat that is left for us to do,
to qualify ourselves to be made partakers of grace, and to improve the
talent which is given to us. And as these things are very flattering to
the pride of our nature, and exactly correspond to the state the devil
left our first parents in, when he had ruined them, so it becomes the
very method which he still pursues with all their poor children, to lull
them on to ruin. "Ye shah be as gods (said the devil to our first
mother) knowing good and evil;" and, in like manner, thus flattering the
pride of our nature, and shutting out Christ, with his blood and
righteousness, does he deceive men now. Now Paul was alarmed and
distressed on this account. The serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, saith Paul, and I fear lest he should beguile you.—How
blessed, then, is the teaching of the Holy Ghost, which strips the
sinner, makes him all bare, leaves him nothing, but shews him his whole
insolvency, emptiness, and poverty, that he may make room for Jesus! And
when he hath thus made the sinner sensible of his nothingness, he makes
him equally sensible of Christ's fulness and all sufficiency; and that
in bringing nothing to Christ, but living wholly </span><span
class="c6">upon</span><span class="c5"> Christ, and drawing all
</span><span class="c6">from</span><span class="c5"> Christ; in this
simplicity that is in Christ, he teacheth the poor sinner how to live
and how to keep house by faith, wholly upon the fulness that is in
Christ Jesus. This is the sweet instruction taught in the school of
Jesus. "I fear, (saith Paul) lest the serpent that beguiled Eve, should
have corrupted you by his subtilty from this simplicity that is in
Christ."</span></p>

Samuel 6:17</h3>
<p>" Is this thy kindness to thy friend?"—2 Sam. vi. 17.</p>
<p>My soul, borrow the words of Absalom to Hushai, and make application
of them this morning to thyself, as if Jesus, the best of all friends,
were thus reasoning with thee. In how many ways hath Jesus manifested
his love to thee. Think of his unparalleled love in the various ways by
which he hath shewn it. He engaged as thy Surety before that thou
knewest any need of one. He took thy nature to fulfil all those
engagements. He loved thee so as to die for thee. He loved thee so as to
shed his blood for thee. He loved thee so as to wash thee from thy sins
in his blood. He loveth thee now, so as to appear in the presence of God
for thee. He loveth thee so as to be continually supplying thee with all
grace, to visit thee, to smile upon thee, to sanctify to thee all his
appointments for thy good; and will never give over until he hath
brought thee where he is, to behold his glory, and to partake of it. And
hast thou not recompensed this love, this mercy, in a thousand, and ten
thousand instances, with ingratitude, with indifference, with
forgetfulness, with disobedience? "Is this thy kindness to thy friend?"
Precious Jesus! I do remember my faults this day. Oh gracious Lord!
grant me from henceforth to live wholly to thee; to be continually
eyeing thee, walking with thee, cleaving to thee, hanging upon thee, and
to remember thee and thy love more than wine. Yes, thou dearest
Redeemer! I would pray for grace to set thee always before me, to record
in my heart thy mercies, and to set up in my heart thy person, to follow
thee whithersoever thou goest, to watch the steps of Jesus, to pursue
thee in all the haunts of thy paths, at thy table, at thine ordinances,
in thy words in thine house of prayer, in thy providences, in thy
promises: every where, and in all things, where Jesus is, there may my
soul be; that, having nothing to give my Lord to recompense his bounty,
I may at least by his grace follow him, to bless him, and to manifest
that all I am, and all I have, is his. My soul, see to it, that this is
at least thy kindness to thy friend.</p>

<p>"And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word. But as
truly as 1 live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the
Lord."—Numb. xiv. 20, 21.</p>
<p>My soul! ponder over this solemn scripture, and observe how truly
awful Jehovah is, even in his mercies. Well may it be said to the people
of God, "rejoice with trembling." This was a memorable moment in the
history of Israel, when the spies returned from searching the promised
land. The evil report which the greater number brought back, in denying
God's faithfulness, is most solemnly recorded; and the falling carcases
in the wilderness, most awfully set forth the divine judgment. And what
is unbelief now but the same, aggravated, if possible, to a ten thousand
times greater degree of guilt, in denying and disbelieving the record
which God hath given of his Son? The apostle saith, "it is making God a
liar," 1 John v. 10. and John the Baptist confirms the same; and adds a
dreadful event, which must inevitably follow: "He that believeth not,
shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth upon him," John iii.
36. And do observe, my soul, how Jehovah engageth to manifest and fulfil
his glory. He confirms it with the most solemn asseveration: "As truly
as I live, saith the Lord, all the earth shah be filled with the glory
of the Lord." And what is the glory of the Lord, but God manifested in
the person of the Lord Jesus Christ? Here all the glory of Jehovah
centers. In Jesus all is proclaimed; and in the dispensation of the
fulness of times, the one great object of all things in the kingdom of
nature, providence, grace, and glory, is" to gather together in one all
things in Christ." What sayest thou, my soul, to these things? Art thou
now gathered to Christ, to whom, as to the glorious Shiloh, the
gathering of the people shall be? Is he that is the Father's glory, thy
glory: is the Father's beloved, thy beloved; the Father's chosen, thy
chosen? Surely, if so, it must undeniably follow, that God is already
glorified in thy view, and in thine heart; i? the glory of the Lord
Jehovah, which is to fill the earth, hath, in the person of his dear Son
filled thy soul and affections, and is formed in thine heart" the hope
of glory." Oh! for increasing evidences of this love of God, and glory
of the Lord, to be shed abroad in my heart, "to give me the light and
knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ!"</p>

20—Morning—Proverbs 3:16</h3>
<p>"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and
honour."—Prov, iii. 16.</p>
<p>What is sweetly said of Jesus in one scripture, as the Glory-wisdom,
is as sweetly sung in another scripture, as the husband of his church
and people. Yes, Lord, thy right-hand blessings may well be called
length of days, for they are life itself, even life everlasting in thee:
and thy left-hand mercies, which include all temporal good, may well
merit the name of riches and honour, for thou givest to all that love
thee to inherit substance, and thou fillest all their treasures. There
is no substance in any, nothing satisfying, nothing substantial, where
thou art not. Why then, blessed Jesus, if these things be so, I would
say to thee, as the church of old did, "Put thy left hand under my head,
and let thy right hand embrace me." This will make every thing sweet,
and every thing precious. Even thy left-hand blessings, in the
sanctified use of afflictions, sorrow, bereaving providences, sickness,
and the like, even these, being Jesus's appointments, will bring with
them Jesus's blessing; and while thine hand is under my head, how shall
these, or aught else, separate me from thee? And concerning thy
right-hand blessings, in the pardon of my sins, washing me in thy blood,
clothing me with thy righteousness, justifying me with thy salvation,
feeding me, sustaining me, leading me, comforting me, bringing me on,
and bringing me through, and by and by bringing me home to glory; that,
where thou art, there I shall be also. Oh, precious Jesus, grant me in
this sweet sense to know thee, and to enjoy thee, in every thing; for
sure I am, that "riches and honour are with thee, yea, durable riches
and righteousness."</p>

20—Evening—Galatians 4:23, 24</h3>
<p>"But he who was of the bond-woman, was born after the flesh; but he
of the free-woman was by promise; which things are an allegory."—Gal.
iv. 23, 24.</p>
<p>My soul! as thou readest this scripture, do not forget to bless the
great Author of it, even God the Holy Ghost, for having condescended to
teach the church the sacred truths contained in it. Never would it have
entered into the heart of man, untaught of God, to have conceived that
the births of Ishmael and Isaac had such divine purposes connected with
their history. We might have read for ever the account given of it in
the book of Genesis, without once forming a thought of the spiritual
tendency of the subject, had not the Holy Ghost, by his servant the
apostle, told the church that it was an allegory. But, blessed with such
gracious teaching, see to it, my soul, this evening, what a delightful
subject it leads to. "These (saith the apostle) are the two covenants;"
meaning the mother of Ishmael, and the mother of Isaac. The
"bond-woman," represents the covenant of works; and the "freewoman," the
covenant of grace. So that all who seek justification by their own good
deeds of the law, are of the children of the bond-woman. All who are
looking for salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ, without the works of the
law, are of the children of the free. As the son of the bond-woman was
born before the son of the free, so our state of nature in this sense,
is before grace. And hence believers, when renewed, are said to be born
again. Yet, as the promise concerning the son of the free-woman, was
before the birth of the son of the bond-woman, so the promise of the
gospel was before the law; and the covenant of grace came in before the
covenant of works. And as the son of the bond-woman mocked the son of
the free, so is it now; they that are born after the flesh do for ever
persecute them that are born after the Spirit. Nevertheless, what saith
the scripture?—" Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the
bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman." The law
can make nothing perfect; justification can never be obtained by the
deeds of the law, and therefore it is rejected. Pause now, my soul, over
this sweet allegory, explained as it is by the Holy Ghost himself, and
ask to which family thou belongest? To both thou canst not, for that is
impossible. Whosoever seeketh justification by the deeds of the law,
denies the merit and efficacy of Christ's blood and righteousness. "For
if righteousness come by the law, then is Christ dead in vain." Oh! for
grace to discover, and faith to enjoy, the same blessed assurance as the
apostle did, when summing up the whole conclusion of this scriptural
allegory; "So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but
of the free."</p>

21—Morning—Deuteronomy 32:10</h3>
<p>"He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
wilderness."—Deut. xxxii. 10.</p>
<p>My soul, behold in this view of Israel thy case and circumstances.
Where did Jesus find thee, when he passed by and bade thee live, but
cast out, loathsome in thy person, and perishing in nature? Remember
then, it was Jesus found thee, and not thou him. And where wast thou
born, and new-born, and nursed, and educated, and trained? Was it not in
a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness? Can any thing be
better suited to represent thy state by nature? is not the heart of man
like the heath upon the desert, that knoweth not when good cometh? Is it
not like the ground, dry, parched, and barren? And as a wilderness is a
land not inhabited, full of perplexed paths and intricate ways, without
food, without sustenance, and no springs of water; can any thing more
strikingly resemble' the whole of thy spiritual circumstances, when
Jesus called thee from darkness to light, and from the power of sin and
Satan, to himself, the living God? And as a wilderness is a barren
state, so is it dangerous also, by reason of the prowling beasts of prey
which inhabit it. And hath Jesus called thee out of it, brought thee to
a city of habitation, and made himself known unto thee as thy Redeemer?
Oh how sweet is it to trace all our spiritual circumstances, in the
mercy, grace, and favour Jesus manifested to Israel, thus beautifully
illustrated and explained, and to see, and know, and truly rejoice in
our unspeakable mercies in Jesus. My soul, never forget then that it was
in the wilderness of nature Jesus found thee. And hath he indeed brought
thee out of it? See then that thou art now coming up from it, leaning
upon thy beloved; hanging wholly upon him, cleaving wholly to him, and
determining for thyself, in every remaining period of time, and to all
eternity, to make Jesus thy all, thy life, thy portion, thy shield, and
thine exceeding great reward!"</p>

21—Evening—Hebrews 9:4</h3>
<p>"The golden censer."—Heb. ix. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> It is blessed, my soul! to behold the numberless
types and shadows of "good things to come," which the church of old
contained; and it is blessed to see them all fulfilled in Christ, the
substance. Jesus, thy Jesus, in his glorious high priestly office, is at
once the censer, the incense, the high priest, and offering, and is now
unceasingly engaged in carrying on the glorious purposes of his
redemption "by appearing in the presence of God for us." He is the
"mighty angel" spoken of, Rev. viii. 3. For upon the </span><span
class="c6">"golden</span><span class="c5"> censer" of his own merit and
righteousness, and by the efficacy of his own glorious person, are all
presentations made. "No man cometh to the Father but by him." coming by
him, and in him, and </span><span class="c6">through</span><span
class="c5"> him, all thy poor offerings come up "for a memorial before
God." And what is the much incense here spoken of, but the merits of
that finished salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ, which hath indeed a
fulness, yea, a redundancy of fulness, infinitely more precious and
costly than ever can be compensated in blessings bestowed thereby upon
his people, in time, and to all eternity. This was beautifully
represented in the Jewish church. The incense was composed of sweet
spices, which made a fragrant smell through the whole temple. And what
was the offering of Christ, but "an offering and sacrifice to God, for a
sweet-smelling savour?" And if the incense in the Jewish temple was
always burning, what was this but a representation of the everlasting
priesthood of Christ, "who ever liveth to make intercession for his
people?" And as the incense was burning </span><span
class="c6">within</span><span class="c5"> in the temple, while all the
people were at prayers </span><span class="c6">without,</span><span
class="c5"> what a lively representation was this of our High Priest in
heaven, in this great office of a priest upon his throne, to offer upon
the golden altar of his divine nature, the prayers of his redeemed upon
earth, to give acceptance to their persons and their offerings, by the
much incense of his own merits and blood? My soul, look up this evening,
look up both night and morning, and, with the eye of faith, behold this
almighty Angel of the new covenant thus appearing in the presence of God
for thee; into his almighty hands do thou commit and commend thine all;
neither thy person nor thy poor offerings can find acceptance but in
him, the beloved. He is thine altar, thy priest, thy sacrifice, thine
incense, thine all; by virtue of whom, God the Father hath respect to
his everlasting covenant, and dispenseth grace in this life, and glory
in that which is to come. Hail! thou glorious, gracious, great High
Priest of a better covenant, founded upon better promises than that by
Aaron! Oh! for faith to apprehend thee, to exercise faith upon thy
person, work, and righteousness, and every day, and all the day, both
night and morning, to come to God by thee, perfectly assured that all
that do come, thou wilt in no wise cast out.</span></p>

22—Morning—Luke 8:49</h3>
<p>"Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."—Luke viii. 49.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, in the exercises of the father of this child, and in
the happy issue of his application to Jesus how very precious it is, to
wait the Lord's time for deliverance, and always to keep in view that
delays are not denials. The poor man's child was nearly dead when he
first came to Christ. And had the greatest dispatch been used, there
would have been still much occasion for the exercise of faith and
patience. But as if this was not enough, another poor sufferer comes in
the way to stop the progress of Jesus in the cure of his daughter, and
during this loss of time his child dies. My soul, here is a sweet
subject for thee. Do thy fears, and unbelief, and doubts, and
misgivings, aided by the suggestions of the enemy, too often prompt thee
to think thy case hopeless; and every thing joins the cry, "thy daughter
is dead, trouble not the Master?" Oh think what a precious opportunity
all these afford thee to follow up the patriarch's faith, and against
hope to believe in hope. What cannot Jesus accomplish? Though the
daughter be dead; though Lazarus be four days in the grave; yet Jesus,
who is the resurrection and the life, need only speak the word, and both
live. In like manner, when exercises arise to the greatest height, until
unbelief suggests all is over; dead frames, a dead heart, deadness to
all; then is the very time to believe, in order to see the glory of God.
Strickly and properly speaking, Jesus cannot be glorified until the
stream of all other resources is dried up. Mark it then, my soul, thy
time to trust Jesus is, when nothing in nature, but wholly grace, must
trust him. And depend upon it, the greater the difficulty for the
keeping faith alive, the greater glory will you give to Jesus in the
exercise of it, and the greater glory that blessed Saviour will receive
from you in supplying that faith during the dead hour, until the
deliverance comes. Hear Jesus's voice in thy instance, be it what it
may, as in the case of this distressed father, for the issue will be the
same. "Fear not; believe only, and thou shalt live."</p>

<p>"And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead
them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light
before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them."—Isa. xlii. 16.</p>
<p>Never, surely, was there a promise of a covenant God in Christ more
strikingly fulfilled as to what is said in the former port of this
verse, than in thine instance, my soul. By nature and by practice, thou
wert so totally blind to any apprehension of divine things, that not a
right thought hadst thou ever conceived of God and Christ, when the Lord
first manifested his grace to thy heart! No being in the universe was so
near to me as God, but none so little known or understood. No heart was
nearer to me than my own, but to all its errors and deceitfulness I
remained the most perfect stranger! In the works of providence, as well
as of grace, I had no consciousness whatever of any guide, nor even of
needing a guide. Self-willed, wayward, and full of confidence, I was
hastening on with the multitude, intent but upon one thing, "in making
provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." Pause, my soul,
and look back! When I take a review of what is past, and trace' the hand
of the Lord, all the way leading me as have come on! am lost in
astonishment in the contemplation of his mercies, and my undeservings.
What a huge volume might be written of both, and in the margin to note
down how they have kept pace together. My soul! If thou wert to read
them by chapters only, what endless ones would they form under the
several sections of the Lord's love, his care,, his wisdom, his methods,
and his grace, in the freeness and distinguishing nature of that grace;
and as I read the Lord's mercies, to note, at the same time, my
rebellions! Oh! what a subject would the whole form, in proof of this
gracious promise, in facing the wisdom, power, and love of God, in
awakening, regenerating, converting, and confirming grace! Surely, Lord,
thou hast indeed brought a poor blind creature, such as I am, in a way
that I knew not, and led me in paths that! never should have known; and
still, Lord, thou art graciously performing the same, in making darkness
light, and crooked things straight. And shall I not, from the latter
part of this sweet promise, derive a strength of faith, from all that is
past, to trust thee for all that is to come? Hath the Lord been gracious
when in a state of total blindness, to bring me by a way I knew not; and
now, when he hath mercifully opened mine eyes to see his glory, and to
love his name, will he not lead me still? Had he mercy upon me, when I
asked it not, neither knew that I needed it: and will he refuse me that
mercy now, when I so earnestly seek it, and know that without his grace
and mercy in Jesus, I shall perish for ever? Precious Lord! give me
faith to believe, to trust, and to depend! Thou, who hast done such
great things for me already, whereof I rejoice, wilt never leave me, nor
forsake me, O Lord God of my salvation!</p>

<p>"Such an one as Paul the aged."—Philemon i. 9.</p>
<p>And what was Paul in the moment here represented? Verily an aged
servant of his Master, but not retired from the scene of action. Paul,
though grown old in the Lord's service, was still as hotly engaged as
ever in the Lord's battle. Art thou such an one, my soul, as Paul was!
Then learn from hence, that however many, or however heavy, former
campaigns have been, there is no rest for thee this side Jordan, no more
than for Paul: no winter quarters for the true soldiers of Jesus Christ.
Until thy captain undress thee for the grave, the holy armour in which
he hath clad thee is not to be taken off. Art thou "such an one as Paul
the aged?" Then, like Paul, see that thou art strong in the Lord, and in
the power of his might. And how sweet the thought! Thy Jesus, who hath
borne thee from the womb, and carried thee from the belly, knows well
the burden of thy increasing years, and all the infirmities belonging to
them, and will carry both thee and them. Yes, my soul, those very
infirmities which the tenderest hearted friend sometimes feels impatient
at, and even thyself, thou knowest not how to bear, Jesus feels, Jesus
commiserates, Jesus will soften! He that hath carried all thy sins,
carrieth also all thy sorrows. Doth he not say so? "even to your old age
I am he; and even to hoary hairs I will carry you!" I have made, and I
will bear: even I will carry and will deliver you. Isa. xlvi. 3, 4.
Precious Lamb of God! henceforth I cast all my burdens upon thee. Thou
hast never called thyself I Am, for nothing. Thou hast indeed made me,
and new made me. Thou hast borne all my sins in thine own body on the
tree. Art thou not both the Alpha and the Omega, both the author and
finisher of my salvation! Oh yes, thou hast been every thing to me, and
for me, from the womb of creation: borne me on eagle's wings; made me,
and new made me; redeemed me in a thousand redemptions, and been better
to me than all my fears! What, indeed, hast thou not done for me? And
now then, being "such an one as Paul the aged," shall I now doubt, or
now fear, when every pain, and every cross, and every new assault from
sin and Satan, bids me go to Jesus. Oh for grace, ever to keep in view
what thou hast said and done, and what thou hast promised. Yes, yes, it
is enough; Jesus hath said, "Even to your old age I am he." The same I
have been, the same I will ever be. "I will never leave thee, nor
forsake thee." Shout, my soul, and cry out, hallelujah. He that hath
been my first will be my last; my strength, my song, my salvation for
ever.</p>

23—Evening—Revelation 8:1</h3>
<p>"There was silence in heaven about the space of ball an hour."—Rev.
viii. 1.</p>
<p>This is a very striking scripture, and records as striking an event,
when took place on the opening of the seventh seal—silence in heaven;
not a suspension or interruption to the happiness of the place, but the
silent adoration of God and the Lamb. This must be the sense of the
passage, if by heaven we are to understand the place where dwell "the
spirits of just men made perfect." But as it is more than probable that
it refers to the events of the kingdom of Christ upon earth, which are
here spoken of under prophetical representations, the silence may rather
be supposed to mean, that the church of God, both in heaven and on
earth, are waiting in solemn expectation of what events the sounding of
the seventh trumpet will bring forth. But there are some sweet
instructions to be taken from what is here .said, of silence in heaven
by the space of half an hour, which in the silence of an evening
meditation, it may be highly profitable to attend to. If in heaven such
solemn pauses are made, doth it not strike the mind, how very becoming
such must be upon earth? Surely it is a sweet frame of the spirit, to
ponder in silence over the many solemn things which connect themselves
with the very existence of man, in a dying state, and in dying
circumstances like the present; more especially, in the solemn seasons
of devotion, when we draw nigh to a throne of grace, in and through the
ever blessed Jesus, a holy silence in the first approaches, seems highly
suitable to await divine visitations. What a lovely view doth the Holy
Ghost give of David, 2 Sam. vii. 18. "Then went king David in, and sat
before the Lord!" And elsewhere he saith, "truly my soul waiteth upon
God :" in the margin of the bible it is, "Truly, my soul is silent
before God," Ps. lxii. 1. The prophets were commissioned to enforce this
by way of command: "The Lord (saith one of whom) is in his holy temple;
let all the earth keep silence before him," Habak. ii. 20. And another
saith," Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord, for he is raised up out
of his holy habitation," Zech. ii. 13. And the Lord himself, having
pointed out the blessedness of waiting upon him, accompanied with a
promise that his people who did so, should renew their strength,
immediately' sends forth this precept: "Keep silence before me, O
islands, and let the people renew their strength; let them come near;
then let them speak," Isa. xli. 1. My soul! learn hence, the beauty of
holiness, and the blessedness of waiting in silence before the Lord. For
then, when the Holy Ghost comes in the refreshing influences of his
grace, and commands the north wind and the south wind to blow, sweet
will be the manifestations of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit, until,"
while the heart is musing, the holy fire from off the altar will be
kindled," and the soul will go forth in all the exercises of faith,
love, joy, humility, and desire upon the person, work, and offices of
Jesus!</p>

<p>"Then ceased the work of the house of God."—Ezra iv. 24.</p>
<p>Ah, how distressed was Zion, when this decree took place; and yet the
history of the church plainly proves that the hand of the Lord was in
it. My soul, are thine exercises sometimes similar? Doth it seem to
thee, as if the work of God in thee was at a stand? Nay, as if it was
totally over? Pause, recollect there is a set time to favour Zion. Thy
Jesus is of one mind, and who can turn him? He is everlastingly pursuing
the designs of his love. And as Zion was graven upon the palms of his
hands, and her walls were continually before him, when she appeared in
her most desolate circumstances; so the work of his grace, in the hearts
of his people, doth not remit, though, to thy view, all thy promising
beginnings seems to be blighted, and, as it seems in thy apprehension,
thou findest growing imperfection. And is not Jesus, by this very means,
emptying thee of self, and all the pride of self-attainments? Is he not
preparing thee for his own glory, by removing in thee the rubbish of all
creature confidences? Remember what is said: "When the Lord shall build
up Zion, he shall appear in his glory." Mark here, that it is the Lord
that is to build Zion: and it is the Lord's glory, and not thine, that
is to result from it. The work of the house of God in thee would indeed
cease, if the work was thine, or thou hadst any hand in the performance
of it. But the same Almighty hands which laid the foundation of this
house, those hands shah also finish it. And by this process, the
glorious Builder is teaching thee to cease from thine own works, as
Jesus, when redemption work was finished, did from his. Precious Lord,
is this the cause, and are these the lessons thou art teaching me, in
the deadness, emptiness, and the numberless complaints under which I
daily groan? Oh then, for grace to cease from self, to cease from all
fancied attainments, and to have my whole heart and soul centered in
thee, in whom alone is all righteousness, grace, work, and fulness. Yes,
Lord, the work is thine, the salvation is thine, the glory is thine, all
is thine; and all that remains for me, is to be for ever giving thee the
just praise that is due to thy most holy name, content to be nothing,
yea, less than nothing, that the power of Jesus may rest upon me; for
when most weak in myself, then am I most strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might.</p>

24—Evening—Judges 13:5</h3>
<p>"A Nazarite unto God from the womb."—Judges xiii. 5.</p>
<p>And what, in the language of scripture, was a Nazarite unto God?
Certainly what the very term implies; one dedicated to God, set apart,
and sanctified. Both the person and character are largely descried,
Numb. vi. 1—21. And was Samson such? It cannot be doubted,
notwithstanding the many strange particularities in his life, which were
departures from sanctity of character. But in that part of Samson's life
wherein the Nazarite was strongly marked, he was eminently proved to be
one; and it is in this feature of the illustrious Danite, that we behold
him as a striking type of the Lord Jesus Christ. My soul! as it hath
pleased the Holy Ghost to give the church so circumstantial an account
of Samson, do thou ponder the subject well, and remark (what was
evidently the only design for which it was given) how gracious the Lord
the Spirit was, thus to set forth, in type, Jesus of Nazareth, so many
ages before his incarnation. Was Samson a Nazarite unto God from the
womb? Such was Jesus, who was so named by the angel before he was
conceived in the womb. And what was the object for which Samson was
separated from his birth as a Nazarite to God? We are told that it was
to deliver his brethren out of the hands of their enemies, Judges xiii.
5. The same was declared of Jesus: he shall be called Jesus; for "he
shah save his people from their sins, Matt. i. 21. Was holiness unto the
Lord the distinguishing feature of the Nazarite? How suitably did it set
forth the Lord Jesus, "who sanctified himself for his people," John
xvii. 19. The very devil himself saluted Christ with his name, when he
said," Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the
Holy One of God." Mark i. 24. And so very important was it considered by
the Holy Ghost, that the church's Lord and Saviour should be known by
this name of" the Nazarite unto God from the womb," that it is
remarkable how many persons have given their testimony, and some of them
plainly without design, to this one character of our Lord. The angel at
the annunciation; the devil, as before remarked; the Jews in contempt,
John xviii. 5; the Roman governor in his inscription on the cross, John
xix. 19; the angels at the sepulchre, Mark xvi. 6; the apostles
glorifying in this name after his ascension, Acts ii. 22; and Jesus
himself, from heaven, at the conversion of Paul, Acts xxii. 8. Precious
Nazarite to God! holy Lord Jesus! thou art indeed the true, the only
one; for of thee, and by thee, can it be said, "Her Nazarites were purer
than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than
rubies, their polishing was of sapphire," Lament. iv. 7. Help me, Lord,
by thy grace, to keep thee ever in remembrance. And while the cry of the
infidel is still heard, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Oh!
may my soul hear thy sweet voice, by faith: "the Lord hath called me
from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my
name!" Isa. xlix. 1. Lord, thus it is fulfilled, which was spoken by the
prophets:" He shall be called a Nazarene," Matt. ii. 23.</p>

25—Morning—Isaiah33:24</h3>
<p>"And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell
therein shall be forgiven their iniquity."—Isa. xxxiii. 24.</p>
<p>What is this? What happy climate is there where any of its
inhabitants are exempt from sickness? Where is that salubrious air, that
is not impregnated with disease? Surely, no where but in heaven. But if
the cause of sickness be removed; if the envenomed dart of sin be taken
out, and hath lost its poison, the inhabitant no longer complains, for
both the evil and the pain are gone. My soul, hast thou found this happy
spot? Hath Jesus manifested such views of his pardoning grace in the
all-sufficiency of his blood and righteousness, that thou not only art
fully convinced and satisfied that his blood cleanseth from all sin; but
that thou as fully believest and resteth in it for thy salvation; and
art of the happy number of those who believe to the salvation of the
soul. Hath Jesus said to thee, as to the poor man in the gospel, "Son,
be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee?" Surely, then, thou art the
inhabitant the prophet pointed at, and art no longer, sick, but dwelling
in the faith, and forgiven thine iniquity. Blessed Physician! I am no
longer sick of that dreadful sickness which is unto death, in an
unrenewed, unpardoned, unregenerated state. But I am sick indeed, and
fainting for the fresh manifestations of thy grace. I am languishing,
thou dearest Lord, for the renewed visits of thy love, the enjoyment of
thy person, the larger, fuller, more constant discoveries of thyself and
thy glory. When wilt thou come unto me? When will the day of everlasting
light break in upon my soul? When shall I behold thee among the
inhabitants of the upper, brighter world? Oh ye spirits of just men made
perfect; ye who now dwell for ever under the perpetual smiles of Jesus's
face; ye who once knew what it was to live in the unceasing desire of
his renewed visits, and how precious all his love tokens are—tell him
what longings my soul now hath, and what faintings I feel for his
manifestation. Tell him, I charge you, Oh ye daughters of the new
Jerusalem, ye that everlastingly behold my beloved, tell him that I am
sick of love.</p>

25—Evening—Colossians 1:18</h3>
<p>"And he is the head of the body, the church."—Col. i. 18.</p>
<p>Sweet view of Jesus! Ponder well the subject, my soul, and behold thy
Lord in this endearing character, and thine own personal union with him.
Jesus is indeed, in every point of view, "the head of his body, the
church." He is so by the Father's own appointment, as our glorious
Surety: in which character he stood up at the call of God the Father,
from everlasting; for when, at that call, he put himself in our stead,
in our law-room and place, he undertook, as the church's representative,
to do all, and to suffer all for her; and what he did and suffered,
they, as his body, might truly be said to do and suffer in him. Sweet
thought! When Jesus obeyed the whole law, then was Jesus their
law-fulfiller. When he suffered the death of the cross, they in him were
crucified. When he arose from the dead, in that resurrection they
partook of the triumph, and, as members of his body, arose with him. And
when he ascended up on high, and sat down on the seat of the Conqueror,
they ascended virtually by their union with him, and may be said" to sit
together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." But, my soul! glorious as
are these views of Jesus, thine husband and thine head, yet are they not
all. He is the head of his body, the church, by his assumption of our
nature. There is an union also of soul, a oneness, a connection as close
and intimate as the natural head of the body with its several members;
for as the head of the body is the source of life, which gives energy
and action to all the parts of the body, so Christ is to his church and
people" the fulness of him that filleth all in all." Here is another
sweet thought! When Jesus took thy nature, my soul, in his sinless
portion of it, he partook of all that could be said to constitute human
nature. "Forasmuch (saith the apostle) as the children are partakers of
flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same," Heb.
ii. 14. hence he must have a tenderness, an affection, a fellow-feeling
(if I may be allowed so to say) for his own nature, in the several
members of his body, the church. This is the very argument the Holy
Ghost, by the apostle, urgeth with poor exercised believers, to convince
them of their safety and assured comfort in him: "We have not an high
priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but
was in all points tempted like as we arc, yet without sin," Heb. iv. 15.
And as this becomes a source of never-failing comfort, to support the
several members of Christ's body with consolation under all their
exercises, (for what can any part feel which the head shall be
unconscious of, and not participate in?) so doth it equally afford
delight in the recollection, that all the wants of the body must be
known and felt by the glorious head, and be by him supplied. Sweet
thought again to the believer! Jesus hath a fulness corresponding to all
our necessities. "It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness
dwell. And of this fulness do we all receive, and grace for grace." Look
up, my soul, and contemplate the infinite, inexhaustible, unsearchable
riches of thy Christ! All awakening, justifying, sanctifying grace; all
life, strength, nourishment, support, are poured upon the members of the
church, from this glorious head: and what sums up the account, and
endears it to the heart, is, that these blessings are everlasting,
unchangeable, and eternal. He hath said, "Because I live, ye shall live
also!" Pause, my soul! And is this Jesus thine? Is he indeed thine head?
Art thou a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones?—Witness
for me, ye angels of light! I renounce all other lords, all other
alliances, all other husbands! It is to Jesus alone that I bend the knee
of love, adoration, and obedience; for he is my Lord God, and I am his
for ever.</p>

26—Morning—Psalm 68:18</h3>
<p>"Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou
hast received gifts for men: yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord
God might dwell among them."—Ps. lxviii. 18.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Sweet view of a risen, ascended, and triumphant
Saviour. My soul, ponder over these words, and while meditating upon
them, see that thou art ascending after thy exalted head, and partaking
in his glories. Jesus is he who hath indeed ascended, far above all
heavens, that he might fill all things. He hath led captivity captive;
and that not only in conquering all the powers of hell, but taking his
people that were in captivity out of the prison-house, and causing them
to partake in the felicity of his triumphs. And mark, my soul, what
follows. "He hath received gifts for men;" or as the apostle to the
church of Ephesus expresseth the same blessed truths, he gave gifts to
men, Eph. iv. 8. And sweetly Jesus hath done both; for he received that
he might give. He needed not for himself, but it was all for his people.
He said himself, when speaking to the Father," that I should give
eternal life to as many as thou hast given me." And, my soul, mark
another sweet expression in these words:" he hath received gifts for
men:" or, as the margin of our old bibles hath it, and our old bibles
are like old gold, precious things, he hath received gifts </span><span
class="c6">in the man</span><span class="c5">; that is, in his human
nature, as Mediator; to give out to his people. See, then, my soul, all
thy blessings are treasured up in him, that is, in one and the same
moment, thy God and thy Brother. Oh glorious thought! Oh!
soul-comforting truth! Neither is this all. For this sweet scripture
points out also for whom he hath received gifts. It is for men. Not for
angels, but for men. Not for holy men neither, but for sinners. Not for
Jews only, but for gentiles. "Yea," saith the Holy Ghost, as if the Lord
the Spirit would lay an emphasis upon it, that it might be particularly
noticed," for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among
them." Oh matchless grace! Oh world of wonders! Fallen angels passed by,
and rebels of men taken into favour. Great Father of mercies, what
manner of love is this, which thou hast bestowed upon our fallen nature?
Oh thou risen and exalted Jesus, send down, Lord, thine ascension gifts.
Nay, blessed Lord, come down thyself and dwell among us. Set up thy
church in the earth, and in the hearts and souls of thy people, and
reign and rule there, the Lord of life and glory.</span></p>

26—Evening—Ephesians 4:9, 10</h3>
<p>"Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also
that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all
things."—Ephes. iv. 9, 10.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! thy morning portion led thee to the
contemplation of a risen and ascended Saviour; and by faith and love, I
hope thou didst find thyself ascending with him, and art now still
looking to him on the throne of the Majesty on high. And while thy
thoughts are thus occupied in the most blessed of all subjects, listen
to this word of God's grace, as of a voice behind thee, to remind thee,
that he who is thus gone up, first came down! He that is now in heaven,
first came down from heaven; he is only returned, as a rightful Lord, to
his own kingdom. He hath, indeed, both by his Father's gift, and his own
purchase, obtained a mediatorial crown, to add to his crown of the
Godhead, which he had before in common with the Father and the Holy
Ghost; but in his ascension, thou art not to lose sight of his descent,
which preceded it, when he left the bosom of the Father, to tabernacle
in our nature, for our redemption, in these lower parts of the earth.
And let this sweet view of Jesus give thee an holy boldness and comfort,
in looking to thy risen and exalted Saviour for those ascension gifts
which he is gone up purposely to send down! I want, my soul (Oh! that
the Holy Ghost would for ever be giving it to me) to keep in constant
remembrance who it is that thus "ascended up far above all heavens, that
he might fill all things." I charge it upon thee, this evening, that
thou never cease to ask this blessing from God the Spirit, that in his
glorifying the Lord Jesus, he would keep it continually uppermost in
thine heart, that it is Jesus who is thus exalted; Jesus thy Brother,
thy Redeemer, thine Husband, thine Head. Surely, while thou bearest in
remembrance, that" he is ascended up far above all heavens, that he
might fill all things," he would never let thee go empty, didst thou
tell him that thou art part of himself! Could Jesus, as the head of his
body, the church, suffer that body, or any of its poorest or least
members, to go lean, and poor, and wretched, while he is gone up
purposely to send down, and to fill all things? To use his own words,
"No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
even as the Lord the church," Ephes. v. 29. Were these things left upon
record as a testimony how Jesus nourisheth and cherisheth the church,
and shall any poor member be without it? Precious Lord Jesus! henceforth
I beseech thee, look on me, and give me, by thy sweet Spirit, to be
always looking unto thee! I see, Lord, that thou, who art </span><span
class="c6">ascended,</span><span class="c5"> art the same that
</span><span class="c6">descended: </span><span class="c5">this is
enough for me; for, sure I am, thine heart is not changed, but thy love
is the same. And if thy love brought thee down to </span><span
class="c6">save,</span><span class="c5"> thy love hath led thee up to
</span><span class="c6">bless:</span><span class="c5"> and what mercy
can my soul want which thy fulness cannot supply? How can a poor member
of thine below, long need, while "Jesus is ascended up far above all
heavens, that he might fill things?" Oh! for grace to come to thee, to
look to thee, to depend upon thee, and to rest, with full assurance of
faith, in that dependence, that Jesus, our risen, our ascended, our
exalted, and full Saviour, will give to every one of his members,
"grace, according to the measure of the fulness of Christ."</span></p>

<p>"Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way,
walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
left."—Isa. xxx. 21.</p>
<p>My soul, who is this Almighty Teacher, out of sight, but the Holy
Ghost? And to what way doth he point but to Jesus, who is both the way,
and the truth, and the life? Art thou ever at a stand? listen to this
voice. Art thou about to turn to the right or left? See how seasonably
he is promised to come to direct thee. Condescend, thou gracious,
matchless Instructor, to guide me. I shall not fail then to know the
wholesomeness of thy teaching, when thou hast opened mine eyes, to see
the wondrous things of thy law. I shall indeed know that thou art my
Director, because thou hast said, "I the Lord teacheth thee to profit."
And when thy word comes not in word only, but in power, and in thee, the
Holy Ghost, surely I shall know it, in that it not only reaches my ear,
but will influence my heart: not only will instruct and teach me in the
way wherein I should go, but will incline my feet to walk in it. Yes,
thou infallible Teacher! I shall know thee to be the Spirit of truth, by
guiding me into all truth. I shall know the voice of the Spirit of
Jesus, because it will prompt me to follow Jesus. Did I hear a voice
telling me of a way of salvation in a righteousness of my own: did I sit
under a teaching, which sent me to my tears, and repentance, and
alms-deeds, by way of recommending me to God: did I listen to the siren
song, which told me of safety in myself, and my own best endeavours, and
that Christ would do the rest: or did any teach me, that I must not come
to Jesus, until that, by some previous acts of soul-cleansing in prayers
and fastings, I had made myself fit: in all these cases, and the like, I
should know that they could not be the voice behind me. promised to
direct; because it is thy one glorious office, thou Holy and Eternal
Spirit, to testify of Jesus, and to glorify him. When, therefore, I hear
the voice behind me, saying, "This is the way, walk ye in it;" and when
it directs me wholly to Jesus; when every thing in this divine teaching
enlightens my mind in the knowledge of the person, relation, work,
power, grace, righteousness, and love of the Lord Jesus Christ; and when
that blessed voice bids me to come unto him, just as I am, a poor, vile,
needy, perishing sinner, to venture upon him for life and salvation, and
how to receive and improve the Lord Jesus, in his infinite suitableness
to all my necessities: Oh how fully verified to my experience is this
sweet promise of my God to my soul! Holy Father, cause me to hear this
blessed voice, in the daily, hourly paths of my pilgrimage; and grant me
the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of thy dear
Son.</p>

27—Evening—Hebrews 9:2</h3>
<p>"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the shew-bread; which is called the
sanctuary."—Heb. ix. 2.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> It is blessed to see how Christ was set forth in
every thing, and by every way in the ordinances of God, during the first
ages of the church. Surely they had the gospel preached to them in type
and shadow, as we have now in sum and substance. My soul, take thine
evening meditation among the furniture of the outer sanctuary, and see
what emblems they afford of Christ. The tabernacle, which Moses made in
the wilderness, contained, in the first apartment, the things here
spoken of. The </span><span class="c6">candlestick, </span><span
class="c5">if without a light, strikingly set forth the darkness of that
dispensation; and if with a light (which seems the most probable, for
the lamps were to be always burning) it shewed that the Lord himself,
who walketh in the midst of the golden candlesticks, is the light of his
people, and the glory of the temple. The next article noticed is
</span><span class="c6">the table, </span><span class="c5">which was
probably placed in such a direction, that the light of the candlestick
might shine upon it; by which we may learn, that in going to the table
of the Lord, we must be directed by his light; for none cometh to the
Father but by him, who is "the way, and the truth, and the life." The
table itself, which was of pure gold, became a most lively type of the
ever-blessed Jesus. The infinite worth and glory of his person, and the
eternal merit and efficacy of his blood and righteousness, may be
supposed to be set forth, by golden representations, as the richest and
most valuable treasure we are acquainted with. And when we add to these,
that Jesus feeds, entertains, supports, nourisheth, and preserves his
church and people, what could so well set forth the royal bounties of
his grace, and the fulness and richness of his house, as that of a
golden table, around which the poor, and the needy, the hungry, and the
faint, might be received and feasted? But the first sanctuary had not
only the </span><span class="c6">candlestick </span><span class="c5">to
guide to the Lord, and the </span><span class="c6">golden table
</span><span class="c5">to receive the followers of the Lord, but the
</span><span class="c6">shew-bread </span><span class="c5">also, to
supply them. This shew-bread was a beautiful and striking representation
of him who is the bread of life. Twelve loaves, in allusion to the
twelve tribes of Israel, were to be always standing upon it, to intimate
the perpetual appearing of Jesus in the presence of God for his people.
They were of the finest flour, mixed with frankincense; thereby
shadowing the purity of his nature, and the fragrancy of his sacrifice
before God. They were to be renewed every sabbath, to shew that Christ
is not only exhibited in the gospel every day, and all the day, but to
be renewed every sabbath, when his ministers bring forth to the people,
out of his treasury, "things new and old." Those taken away when the new
loaves were brought, were to be eaten by the priests alone, under this
Jewish dispensation; and the same is observed under the new: for the
Lord Jesus hath made all his people "kings and priests to God and the
Father;" and if any that are not his, by his Spirit given to them, eat
at his table, they make the table of the Lord contemptible. Are these
some of the delightful subjects, typified by the furniture of the
tabernacle in the first court? Dost thou behold, my soul, these things,
and through the veil and covering, discover Jesus? Oh! then consider the
vast, the infinite importance of redemption by his blood, whom God the
Spirit thus set forth to the church by types and shadows; and see thy
privilege, and the happiness to which thou art called, when in reading
the old testament, "the veil is done away in Christ."</span></p>

28—Morning—Hosea 14:7</h3>
<p>"They shall grow as the vine."—Hosea xiv. 7.</p>
<p>And how doth the vine grow? Why, in those soils that are favourable
to it, vines are not erect like trees, neither are they fixed, as we do
our vines, against walls; but the vine creeps along upon the ground, and
rests its tender stalk and branches upon the nearest prop that will stay
it. And, my soul, is it not so with the believer that wholly leans upon
Jesus, and throws the arms of faith wholly upon him, as the staff, and
stay, and support of all confidence. And there is another property of
the vine which carries with it a striking resemblance to the believer,
namely, the tenderness of its nature, and danger to which it is exposed.
How very weak, and poor, and frail, and helpless, is the child of God.
What can a believer perform in himself. And what an host of foes is he
exposed to; corruption within, and the enemy on every side, makes his
case truly like the vine, exposed to the wild beasts, and nipping winds,
and storms, which every moment threaten to destroy it. And there is a
third particularity by which both are known. While flourishing, to what
an extensive length will the vine throw out her branches, and what an
abundance of fruit will it bear[ And doth not the believer in this sense
grow as the vine, when, from being ingrafted in Jesus, and nourished by
him, and from him, his fruit being found, sends forth the graces and
fruits of the Spirit, and brings forth some thirty, some sixty, some an
hundred fold? And, to mention no more, what a likeness is there between
the dry unpromising stick of the vine, and the lifeless and unpromising
appearance of the believer. As Jesus himself, when upon earth, was like
a root out of a dry ground, so all his followers now are men every where
wondered at. Precious Jesus, thou glorious Vine of thy church, cause me
to be so united to thee, as a branch in thee, the one heavenly plant thy
Father hath planted, that in thee my fruit may be found; that I may be
perpetually receiving fresh communications from thee, and living upon
thee, and to thee, and rejoicing in thee, the source and fountain of all
that is gracious here, and the everlasting spring of glory, happiness,
and joy, that shall be hereafter.</p>

<p>"And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the
holiest of all."—Heb. ix. 3.</p>
<p>The veil of separation between the two tabernacles, no doubt,
typified Christ's body, which, in the moment of his death, by an
invisible hand, was torn in twain from the top to the bottom, thereby
intimating that now all separation was removed, and true believers were
permitted to enter, by the blood of Jesus, into the presence of God, he
having obtained eternal redemption for them. The second or inner
sanctuary, had several very interesting particulars, by way of
distinction, belonging to it. The veil of separation, under the Jewish
dispensation, intimated, that it was impossible for any to draw nigh to
God, but by a mediator. When Jesus threw down the separation, and opened
a new and living way by his blood, access was obtained to God in Christ;
and Jesus, first for himself, and then for his people, led the way into
the holy of holies. The veil of separation set forth how man was
separated by sin; by the injury done to God's holiness, and by the
natural enmity of his own heart. 'But when Jesus came, and put away sin
by the sacrifice of himself, restored that which he took not away, gave
to God his glory, restored to man God's image, and took away the carnal
mind, by making the heart of stone a heart of flesh; then it was, that
the veil of separation was for ever taken away, and the kingdom of
heaven opened to all believers. My soul! what saith thine experience to
these things? If the veil be removed, and thou art entered in, through
Jesus, thy forerunner; then hast thou seen, and known, and felt, and
enjoyed the glory of him, whom those things shadowed; and art rejoicing
in him, as the Lord thy righteousness. And art thou entered within the
veil? Art thou resting upon Jesus, having cast anchor within the veil?
Surely, then, Jesus is precious: his love is precious, his grace is
precious; yea, every thing in him is precious. And then, by and by, all
remaining clouds will be removed, and him whom thou seest now by faith,
thou shalt see, face to face, and know, even as thou art known. Precious
Lord Jesus! take away all remaining darkness, ignorance, unbelief, and
whatever comes in the way of clear views of thee, and the enjoyment of
thee; and let the covering which is cast over all people, and the
blackness over all faces, be removed for the full enjoyment of thee, in
grace here, and in glory to all eternity! Amen.</p>

29—Morning—Romans 5:18</h3>
<p>"As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so, by the righteousness of one, the free gift came
upon all men unto justification of life."—Rom. v. 18.</p>
<p>Concerning the ruin in which thou art involved in Adam, surely, my
soul, thou knowest and feelest it from day to day. No one can persuade
thee out of this. Thou art as much concerned in. the sin, and
consequently implicated in the punishment, of the first man's
transgression, as if thou hadst been, and which indeed as thy root and
head thou really wert, in the garden with him when he did it. And thou
feelest the same disposition to sin the same rebellion in thy very
nature. So that most fully and freely dost thou subscribe to the rights
of God's judgment, that condemnation cometh upon all men, because all
have sinned. Now then see, my soul, whether, through the same Almighty
Teacher who convinced thee of sin, thou art convinced also of the
righteousness of Jesus, and art as fully and as truly interested in all
that belongs unto him. Now as Adam and his seed are one in sin and its
just consequences, so equally Christ and his seed, in the eye of God's
law and justice, are one in Christ's righteousness. Remember, my soul,
and it is a great point to remember, Jesus is never spoken of in
scripture as a single person, and as the Christ of God, but as the
covenant head. He is as much the head, the root, the common stock of all
his spiritual seed, as Adam was the head, and root, and stock, of all
his natural seed. So then, as Adam's sin is the sin of all his children,
because they are his children; even so the righteousness of Christ, the
second Adam so called, is the righteousness of all his children, because
they are his children. This is so plain a truth, that it can need no
further argument. The next point now is, in order to enjoy all the
comfort and blessedness which ariseth out of this precious doctrine,
that thou shouldest be able, my soul, to prove that thou art of Christ's
seed. Very fully thou provest from day to day, by the remains of
indwelling corruption that ariseth within, that thou art of the stock of
the first Adam: how wilt thou prove thy relationship to the second? For,
as upon the presumption, I had not sprung from the stock of Adam, and
none of his blood was running in my veins, I should not have partaken of
his sin, or been subject to his punishment; so equally evident it is,
that if I am not born again and belong to the seed of Christ, I am not
interested in him or his righteousness. Blessed be God! the relationship
with Jesus, as the glorious Head and Mediator of his people, is as
easily to be proved as the relationship with Adam. God promised to pour
out of his Spirit upon Christ's seed, Isa. xliv. 3, 4, 5. Hast thou
then, my soul, the Spirit of Christ as thou hast the nature of Adam? Is
Jesus precious, more precious than gold—his salvation dear—his
righteousness thy only confidence? Canst thou, and dost thou say, with
one of old, "this is all my salvation, and all my desire?" Is he whom
the Father delighteth in, thy delight—he that is the desire of all
nations, thy desire? If these and the like testimonies are in thy
experience, my soul, what greater evidences dost thou need, to manifest
thy relationship to thy Jesus, as thy corruptions prove thee allied to
the old nature? See then, my soul, that thou foldest up this
soul-reviving truth for thy bosom, and carriest it about with thee daily
wherever thou goest; so will Jesus be thy hope and thy portion for
ever.</p>

29—Evening—Acts 21:16</h3>
<p>"An old disciple.—Acts xxi. 16.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! of what standing art thou in the church of
Christ? If there be any thing of real rank and dignity in human life, to
cause one man to differ from another, certainly that age, which
consisteth not in a multitude of years, but in fellowship and long
acquaintance with Jesus, must be most honourable. But in this, as in all
other distinctions, the believer's dignity is the reverse of the
world's. He that is highest in grace, is the lowest in humility. How
beautiful and engaging to this point are the words of Christ: "Whosoever
will be chief among you (saith that divine Teacher), let him be your
servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." Hence the simplicity
and lowliness of the weaned child, Jesus, make the character and feature
of those that are "greatest in the kingdom of heaven." And wherefore is
this? Is it because of our spiritual attainments, or of our improvement
in the divine life? Will our title to salvation be at length made out,
from our having been such a time, or so long a season with Jesus? Is he
"an old disciple," who hath been so many years an attendant on
ordinances, sacraments, hearing sermons, and the like? Is this the plan
of counting years in the school of Christ; and by so much, as we can
number our attendance on the means of grace and improvements under them,
as we fancy in ourselves the progress of our own holiness, do we
estimate an old disciple? Not so, my soul, is the scripture calculation
of age in the divine life. There we read, that" the child shall die a
hundred years old, but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be
accursed," Isa. lxv. 20. What is it then to be" an old disciple?" Surely
he is one that is eldest, in having learned, from the continued
teachings of God the Holy Ghost, to think </span><span class="c6">less
</span><span class="c5">of himself, and </span><span class="c6">more and
more </span><span class="c5">of Jesus. He advanceth the farthest in this
scriptural age, who is growing in grace, by growing in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. His every day's experience brings him
more acquainted with his own unworthiness, so as to endear the infinite
merit of the Redeemer. He is truly "an old disciple," who is old in this
science, of being more out of love with himself, and more in love with
Jesus. For it is impossible, in this progress of the divine life, but to
make advances in this exact proportion; and as the blessed Spirit exalts
Christ to the view, and brings him home to the heart, by so much our
self-confidence lessens; and the more glorious he appears, the more
lowly we become in our own eyes. This is one rule to ascertain the real
age of a disciple. And there is another like it: as those who have long
lived in a family, best know its government, and find themselves more at
home in it; so the oldest disciples in Jesus's household will best know
how to improve a long and growing acquaintance with him, be coming to
him for all they want, and making his glory the one great object of all
their desire. And it will prove indeed that they are faithful to their
Lord's interest, when they not only lay out every thing for his praise,
but receive every thing that he lays out that it may be for his glory.
My soul! what sayest thou to this statement of things, in respect of the
real age of the believer in Jesus? Art thou" an old disciple" of thy
Lord?</span></p>

30—Morning—Titus 3:5, 6</h3>
<p>"Renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through
Jesus Christ our Saviour."—Titus iii. 5, 6.</p>
<p>Precious office of the Spirit! Condescend, great God, to grant it me
this morning. Oh, renew my soul with all thy sweet revivals, after a
night of sleep, as thou renewest the face of the earth. Oh send forth, I
beseech thee, Lord, all thy graces, as suited to my necessities, and the
Redeemer's glory, and let it be most abundantly shed abroad, through all
the faculties of my soul, through Jesus Christ my Saviour. Pause, my
soul, over the blessed prospect, and having now pleaded in Jesus's name
for the mercy, act faith upon thy God in his promises. Is not every
morning a renewing of the Holy Ghost? Is it not said concerning the
productions of the earth, that God "sendeth forth his Spirit, and they
are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth?" See what an
evidence the earth gives in this lovely season, in the fruits, and
plants, and verdure all around. And are the saints of Jesus of a less
sweet-smelling savour, when perfumed as they are with the everlasting
odour of Jesus's never-failing righteousness? Do the fields, when
renewed by the sun of the morning, look gay, and lovely, and after the
dew or the refreshing shower, give out their odour, perfuming the air
with their fragrancy; and shall not the saints of God, when the Sun of
righteousness ariseth upon them, with healing in his wings, send forth
all the blessed effects of that presence which revives the grace Jesus
hath planted, and calls forth into exercise the faith he hath given?
Shall not the showers of his love, when he comes down in them as rain
upon the mown grass, and the dews of the Holy Ghost's renewings, revive
all the languishing frames of the soul, and cause even the desert to
blossom abundantly, and to rejoice with joy and singing? Yes, yes, thou
blessed Lord? methinks I feel thy sweet and gracious renewings. My very
heart is refreshed in the thought. Under thy influence I will look up
and wait the coming of Jesus. He is near. He comes. I hear him say,
"Rise up, my beloved, and come away: for lo, the winter is past, the
rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the
singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
land."</p>

30—Evening—John 11:3, 4</h3>
<p>"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord! behold, he whom
thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, this sickness is
not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
glorified thereby."—John xi. 3, 4.</p>
<p>My soul! ponder these words. It may be said now, as it was then,
Lord, behold he whom thou lovest, yea, many our Lord Jesus loveth, are
at this present hour sick! Who shall calculate the number? Who shall
mark down the tears of the sorrowful of the Lord's people? But Jesus
knows them all; yea, appoints all; and he it is, of whom it is said, "he
putteth their tears into his bottle: are not these things noted in thy
book?" These words suggest another sweet thought. The sorrowful sisters,
in their message to the Lord Jesus, did not tell him that one whom they
loved was sick, but one whom Jesus loved. There could be no doubt of
their love to their brother: but their application to Jesus was on
account of his love. My soul! do not overlook this. It is the most
blessed and the most powerful of all arguments in prayer, when we come
to a throne of grace for those that are near and dear to us, when we can
and do tell the Lord, that they for whom we seek his mercy are the
objects of his love. The observation of our Lord, on receiving the
message, is most delightful. Sit down, this evening, and ponder it well.
It is what ma), with safety be applied to every case, and every exercise
of the Lord's people, in all their eventful pilgrimage through life,
whether in one trial or another. This sickness, this sorrow, this
temptation, be it what it may, "is not unto death, but for the glory of
God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby." Now, my soul,
bring it to the proof. Every rod of Jesus hath a voice, and speaks as
well as corrects; and when at any time he exerciseth it, this is the
invariable language: "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten." And when
the voice is heard, and the soul is thereby brought to listen to the
Redeemer, then the close of the dispensation proves that it is not
indeed unto death, but for the divine glory. So that let the exercise be
what it may, we then see Jesus in it. His wisdom sent it; his love is in
it; and his strength will carry the believer through it; yea, so much of
the Lord's presence will accompany every step we take during the dark
hour, that, dark as things are around, there will be constant daylight
in the soul. And so truly blessed are those dispensations, which, in
their first view, carry a frowning aspect with them, that, when the
sable covering is thus taken off by the hand of faith, on hearing
Jesus's voice under all, they have been found to be tenfold more
productive of the Redeemer's glory and the soul's happiness, than in the
smoother providences, where such exercises have not been given. My soul!
what saith thine own experience to this statemeat? Doth the Redeemer lay
crosses in thy way? Are they marked with his inscription," Bring them
unto me? Art thou visited with sickness, and doth Jesus perform the part
of the tenderest nurse, and sit up by thee? Dost thou hear his well
known voice, saying," As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I
comfort you?" Surely, then, thou wilt fully subscribe to the sweet words
of Jesus, in his answer to the sorrowful sisters. Every exercise and
every trial of the Lord's people, which he sweetens and sanctifies, "is
not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
glorified thereby." For if it teach creature weakness, and Creator
strength; if the believer is made sensible of his helplessness, and of
Jesus's all-sufficiency; if renewed feelings add one testimony more,
that there is nothing but sickness, sin, and sorrow, in us, and
therefore in Jesus alone all our resources of health, and righteousness,
and joy are found: these improvements will always give glory to God, and
magnify the riches of his grace, that "the Son of God may be glorified
thereby."</p>

31—Morning—Matthew 28:18</h3>
<p>"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth."—Matt. xxviii. 18.</p>
<p>Hail, then, thou Sovereign Lord of all! I have lately been following
thee in sweet and solemn meditation through the seasons of thy
humiliation; now let me behold thee on thy throne. And here! am called
upon to contemplate my Lord and my God as possessing universal dominion.
Ponder, my soul, the vast extent. Thy Jesus, as God, as one with the
Father, possesseth in common with him all power from everlasting. This
is his, as God, essentially so; not given to him, for by nature it is
his, being "one with the Father, over all, God blessed for ever. Amen,"
said Paul; so let it be; so shall it be. And so say I, and so saith all
the church; amen, amen. But what thy Jesus saith here, in these blessed
words, is of a power given to him; and that is a power as the head of
his church and people. And although had he not been God, one with the
Father, he never could have been suited for the exercise of this power;
for unless he had been the mighty God, how should he have been the
mighty Redeemer! Yet being God, and both God and man, it is precious to
consider the power that is given to the Lord Jesus, as Jesus, "the head
over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him
that filleth all in all." Here then, my soul, let thy thoughts take wing
this morning. Behold thy Jesus, the head over all principality and
power. See him, by virtue of his Almighty Godhead, exercising and giving
energy to the fulness of his power as Mediator; and in this view
conceive, if it be possible, to what an extent thy Jesus is unceasingly
exercising his power for the everlasting benefit of his church and
people. All power in heaven, not only among the highest order of created
beings, angels and archangels, but a power with God the Father to
prevail for the eternal salvation of all his redeemed. He left it as a
record how he exerciseth this power, when he said before his departure,"
Father,! will that they whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am,
to behold my glory." And he hath power to send the Ho1y Ghost to all his
people. He said himself, before he went away, "If I go not away, the
Comforter will not come; but if I depart I will send him unto you." Here
then, my soul, here let thy thoughts be directed, to meditate upon the
fulness and extensiveness of that power which thy Jesus possesseth in
heaven. Well may it be said that he hath the keys of heaven, when he
hath all power with the Father and with the Spirit. And well may it he
said that he hath the keys of hell also, when all things in heaven and
earth, and under the earth, are subject to his command. And hath he not
power then, my soul, suited to answer every want of thine, and of all
his church and people? Hath he not power over all flesh, to give eternal
life to as many as the Father hath given him? Wilt thou complain, shall
the church complain, of any want, while Jesus is upon the throne? Art
thou poor, is the church poor, weak, helpless, needy, guilty, polluted,
oppressed, exercised? What of all these, and ten thousand other
situations, while Jesus lives, and hath all power? Nay, is it not so
much the better that the people of Jesus are what they are, that they
may be the better suited for his glory, and that their wants may give
occasion for the supplies of his grace? Hail, thou Almighty Sovereign!
Now methinks I would be always poor, always needy, always feeling my
nothingness, that all these may constrain me to come to thee: so that
every day's necessities may afford a fresh occasion to crown thee Lord
of all in a day of grace, until I come to crown thee, with the whole
church, the everlasting Lord of all in heaven, to the glory of God the
Father. Amen.</p>

31—Evening—Deuteronomy 34:5</h3>
<p>"So Moses the servant of the Lord died."—Deut. xxxiv. 5.</p>
<p>My soul! close the month, in contemplating the death of this
highly-favoured servant of the Lord: and mark in him the sure event of
all flesh: "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." What a
blessed account hath the Holy Ghost give of this man. "There arose not a
prophet (we are told) like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face."
But, as if to draw an everlasting line of distinction between him and
his Master; between the highest prophet, and the Lord God of the
prophets; the Holy Ghost was pleased, by the ministry of his servant the
apostle, to state the vast distinction: "Moses verily was faithful
(saith he) in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those
things which were to be spoken after: but Christ as a Son over his own
house, whose house are we;" Heb. iii. 5, 6. Indeed all the great and
distinguishing events in the life of Moses became more or less
brilliant, as they set forth, in their typical representations, the
person, work, or offices of the Lord Jesus Christ. Was Moses the Lord's
minister to bring the people out of Egypt? and what was this but a
representation of the Lord Jesus, bringing his people out of the Egypt
of sin, death, and hell? If Moses led the people through the Red Sea,
and opened a path through the mighty waters; what was this, but a type
of the ever blessed Jesus, bringing his redeemed through the red sea of
his blood, and opening a new and living way into the presence of God? If
Moses kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood through faith, what
was the great object of his faith looked at, but Christ, our passover,
and the blood of his sacrifice? Did he bring the people through the
wilderness; and is not Jesus bringing all his people through? Did he
feed them with manna, and give them water from the rock; and what did
the manna prefigure, but Jesus, the bread of life; and what was the
rock, but Christ, the water of life, in all ages of the church, to his
people? In short, every thing momentous in the church's history, wherein
Moses ministered to the people, pointed, both in law and sacrifice, to
Jesus, the Lamb of God, and his one all-sufficient sacrifice for the
salvation of his redeemed. And even the death of Moses, the servant of
the Lord, over and above the event of death, common to all, had this
peculiar signification annexed to it, that, as the great lawgiver to the
people, it set forth the inefficacy of the law to bring into Canaan:
this could only be accomplished by Christ, who "is the end of the law
for righteousness to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and
also to the Gentile." Farewell, Moses! thou servant of the Lord! Thou,
when thou had served thy generation, wast gathered to thy fathers, and,
like all the patriarchs, didst see corruption: but Jesus saw no
corruption; he ever liveth, and is the same "yesterday, and to-day, and
for ever." Hail, thou glorious Mediator of "a better covenant,
established upon better promises!" Be thou the Alpha and Omega of thy
word, thine ordinances, thy sanctuary, thy servants! To thee all
ministered; from thee all come; in thee all centered; and to thine
everlasting praise all terminate, in bringing glory to Jehovah, Father,
Son, and Spirit, through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

1—Morning—Psalm 110:1</h3>
<p>"The Lord said unto my Lord."—Psalm. 110:1.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Some have called this Psalm, </span><span
class="c6">David's creed.</span><span class="c5"> Certain it is, that
there is scarce an article of a true believer's faith, but what is in
it. My soul, look through it this morning, if thou hast time, and see
whether it is </span><span class="c6">thy</span><span class="c5"> creed.
If not, look at this precious portion of it, and ask of the Holy Ghost
to teach thee the blessed things contained in it. "The LORD said unto my
Lord:" that is, Jehovah said unto my Adonai. Observe, my soul, that
here, as in many other parts of the bible, one of these words Load is in
capital letters, the other in small characters. This no doubt was done
by the translators, by way of telling the English reader that the two
words in the original Hebrew are not the same. They had no better method
of explaining the difference. But by using different sized letters, they
meant to say that there is a difference, and the difference seems to be
this: the word LORD, whenever used in the Bible in capital letters,
signifies Jehovah; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: not as a name of office
in the work of redemption, but as intimating his own glorious
incommunicable essence. The word Lord in small letters, Adonai, is very
frequently (as in this Psalm) applied to Christ in this his gracious
office as the Christ of. God, and of his people. And a most sweet and
precious name it is. It signifies, in a double meaning, </span><span
class="c6">first</span><span class="c5"> his own personal, authority and
power; and, </span><span class="c6">secondly,</span><span class="c5">
that power as exerted and called forth into action for his redeemed.
Look at thy Jesus, my soul, as thy Adonai this day, and every day, and.
a thousand sweet and precious blessings such a view of him, as a
</span><span class="c6">ruler,</span><span class="c5"> and a
</span><span class="c6">support,</span><span class="c5"> and a
</span><span class="c6">sustainer,</span><span class="c5"> will open to
thy meditation. Yes, all-lovely, all-powerful, all-gracious Adonai, thou
art my Adonai! In this thy name, which is as ointment poured forth,
would I contemplate thee. In this thy name would I rejoice all the day,
and in thy righteousness would I be exalted.</span></p>

1—Evening—Psalm 110:3</h3>
<p>"Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power: in the beauties
of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy
youth."—Psalm cx. 3.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> There is so much of the Lord Jesus in this sweet
Psalm, indeed it is altogether so truly a gospel Psalm, that the morning
portion, which was a selection from it, cannot be better followed than
by taking another verse of it for the evening portion, that both
together may furnish out blessed meditations to my soul, in the
contemplation of our precious Jesus. Here are views of Jesus, in all his
blessed offices, as the Prophet, Priest, and King of his people; and
every verse is more or less descriptive of his glorious person, offices,
and character. This precious portion for my evening thoughts, contains
the promise of Jehovah the Father, in his covenant engagements, that the
Redeemer should see the blessed fruits and effects of his undertaking in
the hearts and minds of his elect people. "Thy people (saith the Lord)
shall be willing." So then Jesus had a </span><span class="c6">people
</span><span class="c5">before his incarnation, and that people Jehovah
engaged to make </span><span class="c6">willing;</span><span class="c5">
willing to be saved, willing to receive Christ, and own him for their
Redeemer? Sweet thought of encouragement to the poor sinner! The Lord
undertakes to give the willing mind; so that this is enough to stir the
humblest to attend the means of grace, where Jehovah will make Christ's
people willing in the day of Christ's power. And while it furnisheth out
encouragement to the </span><span class="c6">sinner, </span><span
class="c5">it holds forth instruction to the </span><span
class="c6">saint;</span><span class="c5"> the </span><span
class="c6">former </span><span class="c5">can plead no inability, and
the </span><span class="c6">latter</span><span class="c5"> can make no
boasting; the willingness is of the Lord, and it is in the day of
Christ's power. My soul! thou canst subscribe to this truth. The first
awakenings of grace in thine heart, thou knowest, were not the effect of
thy strength, but the willingness there wrought by divine power. But
there are in this verse, also, "the beauties of the Lord's holiness"
spoken of; "from the womb of the morning." It is indeed to see "the King
in his beauty," and to worship in the "beauty of holiness," when the
Lord's people are made willing in Christ's power, and worship only in
the beauties of Christ's holiness. And such, the promise saith, shall be
the fruitfulness of the womb of conversion in Christ's strength, when he
seeth the travail of his soul, that, as the dew-drops of the morning are
incalculable, so shall be the multitude of redeemed souls that shall
"flee as a cloud, and as doves to their windows!" Precious Lord Jesus!
rule thou as a King, the rightful Sovereign of Zion; subdue thine
enemies to the sceptre of thy grace, and bring every knee of thy people
to bend to the rod of thy power. And Oh Almighty Father! ever let my
poor soul praise thee, love thee, obey thee, adore thee, that thou hast
fulfilled this covenant promise to thy dear Son, in the instance of my
soul Thou hast indeed subdued the natural stubbornness of my nature, and
made me willing to be saved in the Lord's own way. And now, blessed
Lord, I desire to bend the knee of my heart to Jesus, and daily, hourly
ascribe the whole of my salvation "to Him that sitteth upon the throne,
and to the Lamb that was slain, for ever!"</span></p>

2—Morning—Zechariah 14:8</h3>
<p>"Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the
former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in
winter shall it be."—Zech. xiv. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, was not this fulfilled in part when the gospel went forth
from Jerusalem? And is it not now fulfilling, while the same blessed
gospel is going forth from sea to sea, and from the river even unto the
ends of the earth? Surely neither the summer's drought, nor the winter's
frost, shall dry up or congeal those living waters. But, my soul, hast
thou asked of Jesus, as the woman of Samaria did in the moment of
Jesus's promise, for those living waters? Oh if thou knowest, my soul,
this gift of God, and wilt daily, hourly, ask of him both in summer and
in winter, he will give thee these living waters. Oh contemplate their
property, and then, my soul, ask and receive, that thy joy may be full.
Jesus himself is this well of living waters; and wherever he comes, like
the waters in Ezekiel's vision, he gives live, and quickens sinners dead
in trespasses and sins. Also, Jesus in those streams maintains the life
he hath first given. Moreover, Jesus not only maintains, but revives and
renews them, again and again, when the graces of his people languish.
Again, these living waters of thy Jesus are always running: here is
nothing stagnant, but always flowing. Lastly, into whatever heart Jesus
gives them, they shall be, as he hath promised, a well of water
springing up to everlasting life. Are these things so; and have the
saints in all ages, and under all dispensations of the church, both in
the old testament and in the new, been thus supplied? Is it indeed He,
my beloved, who is the same. yesterday, and today, and for ever, that
thus hath supplied, and is supplying, and ever will supply all? Is it
thou, Oh thou precious Lamb of God, that art in the midst of the throne,
leading the church above to fountains of living waters, and becoming the
same to the church below! Wilt thou not give of thy fulness to satisfy
my thirsty soul in this dry and barren land, where no water is? Yes,
yes, my soul, exult with the church of old, for thy Jesus is the same; a
fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon
is my beloved.</p>

2—Evening—Romans 5:8</h3>
<p>"But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us."—Romans v. 8.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> It is a very blessed heightening of divine mercies,
when we behold them as not only bestowed upon those that deserved them
not, but upon those that deserved the reverse of them. It is not enough,
in our account of God's love, to say that God was gracious when we had
done nothing to merit his favour, but that God was gracious when we had
done every thing to merit his displeasure. This is among the sweet
features of the gospel. And the reason is very plain. God himself is an
infinite Being, and therefore his love must be an infinite love. All the
properties of it are infinite; it must be exercised to suit an infinite
power; it must be such as corresponds to infinite wisdom; and its
effects must be such as shall be suited to infinite goodness. Hence,
therefore, in the display of it, such manifestations must be given as
shall set forth, that the love of God, as an infinite Being, totally
differs from the love of man, who is but a finite creature. Our love is
bounded, like ourselves, by </span><span class="c6">circumstances
</span><span class="c5">of a finite, limited, perishing, dying nature,
such as ourselves, and all the creatures around us partake of. But in
the love of God, there are </span><span class="c6">"breadths
</span><span class="c5">and lengths, and depths and heights, passing
knowledge!" Now God commendeth his love towards us by those properties;
that is, he bids us take notice of it by those special marks and
characters. And when the Lord surpriseth the souls of his people by the
same astonishing instance of his grace, in those acts of goodness, he
speaks as in these solemn words: "If it be marvellous in the eyes of the
remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in
mine eyes, saith the Lord of Hosts?" Zech. viii. 6. How sweetly is this
shewn to us in the gift of his dear Son Jesus Christ! When' was Christ
given? When we were enemies. On what account was he given? Purely on
account of God's love. And to whom was he given? Not to his friends; not
to those who had never offended him; not to those who, by their
affection, or by their services, could make some return of
acknowledgment for such blessings; but to poor, helpless, barren,
unprofitable sinners. So that the love of God in Christ is particularly
recommended, sent home, pressed upon our hearts, by this rich display of
it. To have blessed us, or to have loved us, if we had never offended
God, would have been a stream too shallow, too trifling, to shew forth
divine love. No! "God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Pause, my soul! mark these
properties, admire divine, goodness, and learn how to put a proper value
upon the unparalleled love of God in Jesus Christ. So God commended his
love towards us!</span></p>

3—Morning—Psalm 30:5</h3>
<p>"In his favour is life."—Ps. xxx. 5.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Oh for grace to keep this always in view, for then,
thou dear Lord, I should never consider my dead frames, or dead
feelings, since I well-know that thou ever bearest favour and good-will
towards thy people. For if thy providences frown, or seem to frown, do I
not know that behind that aspect thy countenance is the same, always
gracious, always favourable, and that thou art invariably pursuing the
everlasting happiness of thy people? Let it please thee, my Lord, to
grant me this morning such views of thy favour, that I may henceforth
trace it in every thing. Was it not this favour that first opened a
source of salvation? Was it not this favour that brought me into a
participation of it? Was it not this favour that begat me to the
knowledge of it—that quickened me to an enjoyment of it—that opened the
communication</span><span class="c6"> </span><span class="c5">of it, by
which thy grace became imparted to my soul? And was it not the same
favour that kept alive the incorruptible spark, and maintained it
through all the attempts of sin, and the world, and the powers of
darkness to extinguish it? Nay, blessed Jesus, what is it now but thy
favour that secures me in thy love, and gives me all the inexpressible
felicities of mercy, pardon, and peace now, and everlasting glory
hereafter? And is not thy favour, then, better than life? Is it not more
precious than rubies? Can there be aught desirable like it? Truly, Lord,
in thee and thy favour I have life, for thou art both my light and my
life; my heart trusteth in thee, and I am helped. "Remember me then, Oh
Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people, Oh visit me
with thy salvation.</span></p>

3—Evening—Exodus 17:15</h3>
<p><span class="c6">"Jehovah-nissi."</span><span class="c5">—Exod. xvii.
15.</span></p>
<p>Jehovah-nissi, is the suitable inscription for every undertaking. The
meaning is, "The Lord is my banner." And how blessed is it to set this
over us in all the conflicts of our warfare, because it appeals to God,
and calls in God to our help in all emergencies. Hence the church cries
out, "We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
wilt set up our banners." Ps. xx. 5. And how lovely is the church
described, when strengthened in the Lord her God, "looking forth as the
morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army
with banners Song vi. 10. But this inscription hath a yet more special
reference to Jesus. The history to which it belongs, gives us an account
of Amalek, with whom the Lord declared "he would have war from
generation to generation." Now as Joshua was a type of Christ, so Amalek
became a type of the devil. Thereis nothing neutral in this war; "He
that is not for us, is against us;" but what a blessed relief is it to
the soul, that the issue is not doubtful! While Christ is our banner,
and Jehovah-nissi the glorious name under whom we fight, we shall be
more than conquerors through him who helpeth us. The cause is his, the
glory of God in salvation his, the everlasting issue of it his, and the
whole termination his. Hence we go not forth as to a thing doubtful, but
already sure. Sit down, my soul, this evening, and write Jehovah-nissi
upon all that concerns thee. The Lord is engaged for thee in this holy
warfare. The Lord hath sworn that he will have war with all the enemies
of his Christ, from generation to generation. Hence he will have a
suited grace, and a suited strength, proportioned to the wants of all
his people. The name, the person, the work, the righteousness, the
finished salvation of the Lord Jesus, is, and must be a banner for
triumph, because of the truth. Therefore, as David, who, long before he
had possession of the kingdom, enjoyed it by faith; so in Jesus, our
Jehovah-nissi, we may with confidence cry out as he did, "Gilead is
mine, Manasseh is mine;" Christ is mine, and heaven is mine; yea, all
things are mine; for "Christ is the strength of my life, and my portion
for ever."</p>

<p>"Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my
garden."—Song iv. 16.</p>
<p>Are these the words of my Lord? Yes, surely, they can be no other;
for none but Jesus can send the Holy Ghost to his church and people. And
besides, none can call the church "my garden," but he that is the
rightful owner of it. Surely, Lord, it is thine, both by thy Father's
gift, and by thy choice, and by thy purchase, and by the conquests of
thy grace, and by the voluntary surrender of thy people, when thou hast
made them willing in the day of thy power. And dost thou call then, both
the north wind and the south, thou dearest Lord, to blow upon my soul?
Dost thou command all suited influences of thy grace to visit me, that
one may search, and another warm my affections, and call thine own gifts
and graces forth in exercise, upon thy glorious Person, and thy glorious
work? Oh come then, thou Holy Spirit, with all thy sweet and precious
offices. Come, Lord, to convince and comfort me, to humble and direct
me, to chill my affections to the world, and to warm them towards the
Lord Jesus. Come, thou holy, gracious, almighty, quickener, reviver,
restorer, and glorifier of my God and Saviour! Oh if thou wilt make my
soul like the chariots of Amminadib, and cause those graces thou hast
planted there to go forth in a way of love, and desire, and faith, and
expectation, and hope upon the Person and glory of him whom my soul
loveth, then shall I cry out with the church, and say, "Let my beloved
come into his garden, and eat of his pleasant fruits."</p>

4—Evening—Deuteronomy 33:3</h3>
<p>"Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thine hand."—Deut.
xxxiii. 3.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, here is a very blessed portion to meditate
upon in the night watches, and to lie down with, reposing in the bosom
of Jesus. The word </span><span class="c6">yea, </span><span
class="c5">is a sweet scripture word, and very strong to the purpose.
God's "yeas," and "amens," are firmer than all the oaths of creatures;
and when Jehovah puts his </span><span class="c6">yea</span><span
class="c5"> to the love that he hath to his people, it ought to give
great comfort and confidence to our faith. And Oh what testimonies hath
Jehovah, in his three-fold character of person, manifested, in the
Father's love, the Redeemer's grace, and the Holy Ghost's fellowship, in
proof of this affection! Blessed Lord! help me to keep it in
remembrance. But, my soul, do not stop here. Mark what the Holy Ghost
hath said, as a farther testimony of it: "All his saints are in thine
hand." In whatever point of view we read these words, they become
blessed. Whether the saints of the Lord Jesus, here spoken of, be old
testament saints, or new testament believers, the sense is the same.
Jesus committed all his people into his Father's hands. "Keep them,"
cried the Saviour, in that divine prayer, the specimen of his holy
intercession, "keep, holy Father, through thine own name, those whom
thou hast given me!" John xvii. 11. And hence, the Redeemer elsewhere
saith, "My sheep shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of
my hand. My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all, and none is
able to pluck them out of my Father's hand; I and my Father are one."
John x. 28, 29, 30. Think, my soul, how eternally safe and secure must
the church of Jesus be, thus kept by the mighty power of God, through
faith, unto salvation! What shall unclasp the hands of Jehovah? Who
shall wrest the weakest, the humblest, the poorest of Christ's little
ones, from the holding of his omnipotency? Why then art thou, my soul,
so frequently exercised with fears, and doubts, and misgivings? It is
the Lord's love that is the foundation of thy assurance, and not the
strength of thy graces! His own free mercy, and not thy merit, were the
first causes of thy calling; and what is it now, in thy present
preservation, but the same which holds thee up, and carries thee through
every difficulty? "Yea, he loved the people:" that is, the source, the
reason, the sole motive. And their safety he secures: "All</span><span
class="c6"> </span><span class="c5">his saints are in thy hands!"
Precious Lord Jesus! it is enough. How shall a child of thine perish,
when secured by such almighty support? Oh! to hear thy voice, in the
soft whispers of thy love, comforting my soul, as thou didst the church
of old: "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget; yet, will I not
forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
walls are continually before me."</span></p>

5—Morning—Acts 19:11</h3>
<p>"Have ye received the Holy Ghost?"—Acts xix. 11.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder over the solemn question again and again, and then
see what answer thou canst give to a point so infinitely interesting and
important. The Holy Spirit is clearly known by the exercise of his
blessed offices in every heart where he abides, and where he is the
glorious inhabitant. He comes in Jesus's name as an ambassador, to
propose to the sinner a rich and precious Saviour. He comes as au
almighty teacher; and this condescending office he graciously exerciseth
in convincing of sin, and convincing of the righteousness of Jesus. He
comes as an advocate; and by his pleading the cause of a poor sinner's
own necessities, and the cause of a rich Saviour's willingness and
ability to supply all these necessities, he manifests himself a most
powerful advocate, when, by his constraining grace, he makes the poor
sinner willing in the day of his power. He comes as an enlightener of
the dark and untutored mind of the sinner. And this he doth most
effectually, when, by shining in the heart, he gives "the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." Most
gloriously he shines upon the soul, when, by the ministry of his blessed
word, and by the influences of his divine grace, he leads the mind forth
to the contemplation and love of the person, blood, and righteousness of
the Lord Jesus Christ. He comes as a witness also to testify of Jesus.
And this sweet office is manifested in the conscience when at any time
he shews sin to be exceedingly sinful, and that nothing but the blood of
Jesus can cleanse from it. And his witness in the soul is proved to the
fullest demonstration, when he powerfully brings the guilty conscience
under so deep a sense of sin, and so alarmingly concerned for the
consequences of it, that nothing will satisfy until Jesus is revealed
and brought home to the heart in all the beauties of his Person, and the
fulness and suitableness of his salvation, and formed there the hope of
glory. He comes also as a Comforter; and Oh how sweetly and fully doth
he manifest both the power of his Godhead and the sovereignty and grace
of his character, when, by his consolations, as he opens and explains
them, and makes application of them as they are in Jesus, he revives the
drooping spirit, relieves the depressed spirit, animateth, refresheth,
sanctifieth the whole heart, and soul, and mind, and gives a joy and
peace in believing, abounding in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. My
soul, what sayest thou now to the question? "Hast thou received the Holy
Ghost?" Surely, I do know thee, thou gracious God the Spirit, by these
sweet tokens of thy covenant office and character. Lord, I pray thee, be
ever with me, and, agreeably to Jesus's gracious promise, abide with me
for ever. Oh may I never grieve thee, by whom my soul is sealed in Jesus
to the day of eternal redemption.</p>

5—Evening—Habakkuk 3:13</h3>
<p>"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
salvation with thine anointed."—Hab. iii. 13.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Every view of redemption is blessed: but there are
some views transcendently so. And when the soul is led out in the
contemplation of Jehovah, in his threefold character of person, Father,
Son,</span><span class="c6"> </span><span class="c5">and Holy Ghost, all
engaged, in their goings forth from everlasting, for the accomplishment
of it, there is somewhat which overpowers the mind with the greatness,
and the surpassing glory of the subject. As the salvation of the Lord's
people is from Jehovah, and from all eternity; so it is to Jehovah, and
to all eternity. All the springs of it are from this one source, and
tend to this one end. The song of heaven, which John heard; so
proclaimed it: for while the address was to the Lamb, in ascribing to
him all the glory of the work; the great purpose for which it was
wrought, was ascribed to the Father: "Thou wert slain, and hast redeemed
us to God by thy blood;" Rev. v. 9. My soul! mark the similar expression
in this song or prayer of the prophet. Jehovah" went forth for the
salvation of his people; even for salvation with his anointed." And was
not Christ the anointed of the Father! And did not Jehovah go forth with
Christ, upholding, supporting, carrying on, and completing, redemption
work in, and by, and with Jesus? Yea, did not Jesus go forth from
everlasting, when his delights were with the children of men before the
world? Is it not of Jesus that it is said, "Then I was by him, as one
brought up with him; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always
before him; rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my
delights were with the sons of men?" Prov. viii. 30, 31. Oh! the
soul-comforting subject! How truly blessed to see the whole Godhead thus
engaged in the salvation of poor sinners! Yes! Blessed Lord Jesus! it is
plain, that in all the goings forth of Jehovah, the redemption of thy
church was the one grat object and design. Before time began to be
numbered, thou wentest forth. In time, when thou camest in substance of
our flesh, still the salvation of thy people was the object. And now in
eternity, thou art still going forth, in thy priestly office on thy
throne, which thou art carrying on in heaven to the same purpose, to
make the salvation of thy people secure. Oh for grace to keep these
views always in remembrance, that, while Jehovah is thus, in one eternal
act, going forth for the salvation of his redeemed, all his redeemed may
go forth in love, and adoration, and praise, in the acknowledgment of
the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ: and here on earth
begin the song which is never to end in heaven: "To</span><span
class="c6"> </span><span class="c5">him that loved us, and washed us
from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto
God and his Father: to him be glory and dominion, for ever and ever.
Amen."</span></p>

6—Morning—Psalm 68:19</h3>
<p>"Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits."—Ps.
lxviii. 19.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul, what a sweet portion for thy morning meditation is
here. See what thou canst gather out of it to furnish new songs of
praise to the bountiful Lord whose mercies it records. Blessed Spirit! I
beseech thee open these precious words of thine to my view. Blessed be
the Lord, it saith, yea, so say I; blessed be Jehovah; blessed be the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for they are the united source of all my
blessings. And blessed be the majesty and glory of God for ever, who
daily loadeth his people with benefits. Count over, my soul, each of
these blessed expressions, for every word is weighty and ponderous. God
not only gives blessings, but daily. His mercies are constant as the
morning, unceasing, continual; strength suited to the day, and mercies
adapted to every moment. Faith needs no hoards, no banking-houses: nay,
it is faith's precious property, and her blessedness, to be always
empty, in order that the sweetness of being filled by Jesus may be the
better known. But this is not all. God not only daily gives out
blessings, but loadeth his people with benefits. He openeth the windows
of heaven, and poureth out of his grace in such fulness, that there is
not room to receive. He makes their souls like the heart of Elihu, as it
is said of him, for want of vent, like new bottles he was ready to
burst. So Jesus poureth out of his love into the souls of his redeemed,
that they are overpowered with his goodness. Knowest thou not, my soul,
somewhat of this! Oh yes, I trust I do. Why then, "blessed be God, who
daily loadeth me with his benefits." And what endears all this in a ten
thousand times greater degree, is the assurance that the whole is in a
way of salvation. So saith this sweet scripture. He that loadeth us with
benefits, is the God of our salvation. He that is our God, even he is
the God of our salvation. Oh precious, blessed consideration, then are
these blessings everlastingly secured; for he that now daily loadeth us
with benefits, will unweariedly do the same to all eternity. He is not
only the portion of his people now, but will be so for ever. He not only
gives strength equal to the day, but will himself be our strength to all
eternity. And mark it down, my soul, as the most blessed part of those
daily benefits; he that thus loadeth the soul with all the benefits of
covenant blessings, in the grace, mercy, favour, love, blood,
righteousness, and all the sweet tokens of redemption in Jesus, signs
and seals every one of them in his dear name: and as he said to Abraham,
so he saith to all Abraham's seed, "Fear not, I am thy shield, and thine
exceeding great reward." Shout then, my soul, and henceforth let this be
thy morning song: "Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth thee with
benefits."</p>

6—Evening—Hebrews 9:28</h3>
<p>"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them
that look for him, shall he appear the second time without sin unto
salvation."—Heb. ix. 28.</p>
<p>My soul! pause over this blessed portion, for it is most blessed, and
seek from God the Holy Ghost, grace to gather all its sweets for thine
evening enjoyment. Every word is big with importance. And, first, who is
it that is here said to have been once offered? Even Christ, the sent,
the sealed, the anointed of Jehovah. So that when thou goest to a throne
of grace, to plead for mercy in the blood and righteousness of Jesus
Christ; thou goest in his name, whom thy God and Father hath appointed.
Thou then tellest thy God, what thy God first told thee. He, in whose
name, blood and righteousness, thou askest redemption, is he whom
Jehovah himself "hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith in his
blood." Hence it is impossible not to succeed. "I have given him (saith
the Lord) for a covenant to the people." Next, consider the fulness, the
greatness, the all-sufficiency, of this sacrifice, which thy Jesus hath
offered. He was once offered. Yes! it is enough: "For by that one
offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." There
was, and is, more merit in that one offering of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to take away sins, than there is demerit in all the sins of his people
for ever. Mark this down also, when thou goest to the throne. Thou art
seeking redemption, upon the plea and footing of a full and rich
equivalent made by thy Surety, under Jehovah's own appointment and
authority. Then go on to that other most interesting part of this
precious verse: "And unto them that look for him, shall he appear the
second time without sin unto salvation." Pause, my soul, over these
words. When thy Jesus appeared the first time, he came as the burden
bearer of all the sins of his redeemed. And though in himself "he was
holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens;" yet he was made both "sin and a curse for us, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him." Hence all the sins of
his redeemed were charged upon him, and" the Lord Jehovah laid upon him
the iniquity of us all." But when he had by himself purged our sins, the
whole weight and pressure of sin, with all its tremendous effect, were
for ever done away. And therefore unto them that look for him, when he
shall appear the second time, it will be without sin unto salvation. He
put away sin by his first coming; and by his second, he will put all his
redeemed into the complete possession of that salvation which, by his
one offering up of himself for sin, he hath eternally secured. What
sayest thou, my soul, concerning thyself, and thy personal hope in these
glorious things? Art thou one of that blessed happy number who are thus
looking for Jesus? Dost thou believe that Jesus died and rose again? Art
thou so well pleased with the merits and efficacy of this one offering
of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all, as to seek no other, to
desire no other; yea, to renounce and despise every other? Pause, and
duly consider. These are solemn soul transactions. A mistake here, is a
mistake indeed. Oh! it is blessed to be well pleased with what Jehovah
hath declared himself well pleased with: and to be satisfied, yea, well
satisfied, with what Jehovah is well satisfied. For then thou wilt be
daily on the look out for thy Lord's return, as one that is on the look
out for a dearly beloved friend. And thus, if thou art in love with his
appearing; loving all that appears to promote thy Redeemer's glory on
earth, in the conversion of sinners, and comforting of saints, loving
his church, his Zion, his ordinances, his people; shortly the hour will
arrive, in which the Master will come, and call for thee; thou shalt
hear his chariot-wheels at the door, and his voice will be distinctly
heard by the waiting spirit; "Arise, my fair one, and come away!"</p>

<p>"If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto
him, and saith, deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a
ransom."—Job xxxiii. 23, 24.</p>
<p>My soul, how precious are those views, in looking back upon where the
first discoveries of grace were made. Moses never forgot the first
visions of God at the bush; neither did Jacob outlive the remembrance of
the first Bethel-visit of a God in Christ to his soul; and why should I?
Hast thou not known this messenger, this interpreter, one among a
'thousand to shew unto thee' God's uprightness? Oh yes, Jesus by his
Spirit hath shewn to me that my "God is righteous in all his ways, and
holy in his works." When by the blessed discoveries which had been made
to me in his word, by his ordinances, providences, judgments, mercies,
like the poor creature described in this sweet scripture, when reduced
to a mere skeleton, by reason of soul sickness, driven out of all
resources in myself, and utterly despairing of ever seeing the face of
God in glory, by any creature attempts, and by all creature
righteousness, Oh then it was, thou blessed, glorious messenger of thine
own covenant; thou faithful interpreter of the mind and will of Jehovah;
then it was I was led to see the freeness, fulness, suitableness, and
all-sufficiency of a Redeemer's righteousness, and to cast my poor
defenceless, naked, trembling soul upon the rich, powerful, and
altogether-sufficient salvation, of thee, my God and Saviour! Oh how
hast thou sweetly and mercifully explained to me the secrets of covenant
mercies, the glories of thy person, and the greatness of thy finished
work. And now at every step I take, at every portion of thy blessed word
I read, when my mind feels the remains of indwelling corruption, and all
the lurkings of the enemy's suggestions 'within; then, then it is I hear
the Father's gracious voice, "Deliver him from going down to the pit, I
have found a ransom." Yes, precious Jesus, thou art my ransom, and my
righteousness for ever!"</p>

contemplation. And if he who hath prepared the banqueting-house, and
well stored it with every thing to afford a spiritual repast, will lead
thee thither, and regale thee there with the rich enjoyment of himself,
and the fulness of blessings in him, thou wilt have a feast of fat
things indeed! Come then, this evening, and take a view of Jesus's
banqueting-house, and wait on thy kind and condescending Lord. He hath
been known to take home many a poor waiting hungry sin-net, that hath
been on the look-out for him, to his banqueting-house, and given him a
gracious, full, and satisfying entertainment. Come then, my soul, and
see this banqueting-house of Jesus. </span><span

God the Holy Ghost, is found. Oh! the blessedness of this covenant! Well
might David, when he was brought into it, exult and say, "This is all my

</span><span class="c5">have looked at the banqueting-house, and thought
it meant the </span><span class="c6">church, </span><span class="c5">the
house of God; for here all the blessings of the covenant are given to
the guests which Jesus brings into it. And here again we find, that they
who are blessed with a place in God's house are so delighted, as to
resolve to go out no more. "Here would I dwell (is the language that
expresseth the sentiment of all): this is my rest for ever; here will I
dwell, for I have a delight therein," Ps. cxxxii. 14. And some have
looked at the banqueting-house of the Lord Jesus, and considered, that
it is the blessed "word of God, the scriptures, of truth." And certain
it is, that" they contain the words of eternal life;" and open every
day, and all the' day, an everlasting supply to banquet the hungry soul,
and to satiate the sorrowful soul. One, who could not be mistaken, said,
when he had been feeding upon the rich things contained in it, "Thy
words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy
and rejoicing of my heart," Jer. xv. 16. And </span><span
class="c6">another, </span><span class="c5">not less taught, cried out
in a transport," O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day,"
Ps. cxix. 9. But I see no reason why the whole may not be considered as
the banqueting, house of Jesus. For when, by the sweet influences of his
Spirit, he hath brought his redeemed into a heart-felt enjoyment of an
interest in his covenant, his church, and scriptures, every word,
ordinance, and means of grace, with all the promises, are the
inheritance of his people. Pause, my soul, and inquire, whether the Lord
Jesus hath thus brought thee in? Art thou acquainted with his
banqueting-house, and convinced that none but Jesus could bring thee in?
It is a solemn thought! Man may attend the church, may read the
scriptures, follow ordinances; yea, go to the Lord's table; but unless
Jesus, by his Holy Spirit, lead the sinner there, meets him there, and
blesseth him there, to what purpose will be the going? Look to it, my
soul, that thy visits are by the Lord's invitation, and thy welcome from
him; yea, that he leads thee by the hand, meets thee, and blesseth thee;
sets his banner over thee of love, and bids thee partake largely in the
riches of his grace and salvation, in those well known words of thy
Lord: "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O
beloved."</span></p>

8—Morning—Numbers 19:9, 3</h3>
<p>"A red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which
never came yoke. And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he
may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his
face."—Numb. xix. 9, 3.</p>
<p>I remember well it is said of our Lord Jesus, that, in order to
sanctify the people with his own blood, he suffered without the gate.
But though I clearly apprehend that the law, with all its sacrifices,
was but a shadow of good things to come, and the body was Christ, yet,
had not the Holy Ghost been graciously pleased to illustrate and
explain, by other scriptures somewhat either direct, or by allusion, in
reference to Jesus, I should have overlooked how, in many striking
points, Jesus is here set forth in this type. Surely, Lord, thy spotless
purity was beautifully represented in the spotless heifer here appointed
for sacrifice. And the very rare colour of a red heifer plainly
testified the singularity of thy sacrifice. Adam himself was so called,
as a token of the red earth from whence he was taken. And when Jesus, as
the Son of man, came to do away all the effects of Adam's sin and
transgression, he manifested, by the redness of his apparel, and the
blood sprinkled upon his garments, the gracious purposes which all
implied. But I do not recollect, in any other type of my Redeemer, a
particularity which pointed to the freeness of thy voluntary sacrifice,
Oh thou Lamb of God! as the one here represented, in that this heifer
was to be one upon which had never come yoke: nothing, Lord, but thine
own free, sovereign love, and at the call of God thy Father, prompted
thine infinite mind to be the willing sacrifice for poor sinners. There
was no yoke, no obligation, nothing to compel thee. Lo, I come, was thy
gracious voice, when neither sacrifice nor offering could ransom thy
people. Oh Lord! let the sense of thy freeness in salvation comfort my
soul under all heart straitenings in myself; and the consciousness that
there was no yoke upon thee, Lord, but thine own everlasting love, be
the sweet constraining yoke on my soul, to bind me to thy love and to
thy service for ever.</p>

Peter 1:8, 9</h3>
<p>"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory;
receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."—I
Pet. i. 8, 9.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! mark what a blessed testimony believers of
the present hour are here said to give to an unseen, but dearly beloved
Redeemer; and behold what blessed effects are induced in the soul by
such lively acts of faith upon his person and righteousness! And,
indeed, when it is considered who Christ is, what he is to us, what he
hath done for us, and what he is for ever doing for us, and will do to
all eternity, who but must love him? In his person all divine
perfections center; whatever tends to make any creature lovely, in
heaven or on earth, is found in Jesus in the most eminent degree. For
there is nothing lovely in creatures of any character, whether angels or
men, but it is derived from him: it is Jesus who gives all that
excellency and grace which they possess; the whole is found in him, and
received </span><span class="c6">from </span><span class="c5">him. And
when to these views of what Christ is in himself, the believer adds the
consideration of what he is to him, what he hath wrought, and what he
hath accomplished in redemption for him, such thoughts of Jesus, under
the teachings of the Holy Ghost, in his glorifying him to the soul, give
"a joy unspeakable, and full of glory." My soul! what saith thine own
experience to these truths? Surely Christ is a portion full enough, and
rich enough for every poor needy sinner to live upon to all eternity.
And if thou hast been taught (as I trust thou hast long since been
taught, and long proved) that all the fulness in Jesus is for his
people; that his grace is magnified in giving out of his fulness to
supply their need; yea, that Jesus waits to be gracious, and is as truly
glorified, when a poor creature lives by faith and joy upon his bounty,
as he is when that poor creature lays himself out in praises for that
bounty; surely, though thou hast never seen Christ in the flesh, yet by
faith thou hast seen him, and lived upon him, and hast such believing
views of him, as giveth thee present peace, and immediate enjoyment of
salvation. Oh! the felicity of thus realizing future things by present
possession! Oh! the blessedness of substantiating things unseen by the
strength of that faith which worketh by love! See to it, my soul, that
thy God and Saviour is increasingly precious, and increasingly lovely,
day by day. See to it, that he who is lovely to the Father, and to the
Holy Ghost; the praise of all his saints in glory; the joy and adoration
of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect; and lovely to all
creation, but to devils and poor blind unawakened sinners: see to it, my
soul, that this lovely and all-loving Jesus is the first, and best, and
completely satisfying object of thy delight; that this blessed
testimony, which the Holy Ghost hath here given of the faithful, may be
thine; and that though not having seen Jesus, you love him, and though
unseen, you believe in him. This will be to "rejoice with a joy
unspeakable, and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even
the salvation of your soul."</span></p>

9—Morning—Song of Solomon 8:2</h3>
<p>"I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my
pomegranate."—Song viii. 2.</p>
<p>What, my soul, hast thou aught to offer to thy Jesus? Will he accept
a present at thine hand? Yes, Jesus will accept those goings forth of
his own grace, his own gifts, in the exercises of faith, and love, and
joy, and praise; when, by his own sweet and reviving communications, he
hath called to the north wind, and to the south wind, to blow a gracious
gale upon my soul, and causeth the very graces he himself hath planted
in my heart to send forth all their powers in the enjoyment of his
person and righteousness. And do not forget, my soul, for thine
encouragement to this lovely and becoming frame, these will be more
grateful to thy God and Saviour than all whole burnt-offerings and
sacrifices. These will be indeed like spiced wine, and the juice of the
pomegranate, when those tears of faith, and love, and repentance drop at
the mercy-seat, in the contemplation of that love of Jesus, which is
better than wine. Help me then, thou dear Lord, thus to come to thee.
Help me, as the poor woman at thy feet did, to shed my tears, and to
offer thee this spiced wine: and no longer by sin and unbelief; and
rebellion, to give thee wine mingled with myrrh, as the Jews did at thy
crucifixion. Oh God, my Saviour! let it never be said of my soul, from
neglect and indifferency to thee and thy sufferings, as thou complainest
of them, "They gave me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink." No, precious Lord! if thou wilt shed abroad the
influences of thy Spirit in my heart, so as to lead out my whole soul in
love to thee, in living upon thee, in contemplating thy glory, thy
suitableness, thine all-sufficiency, then will my soul praise thee with
joyful lips; and then will my beloved say, as to his church of old," Thy
lips, Oh my spouse, drop as the honey-comb; honey and milk are under thy
tongue."</p>

9—Evening—Psalm 1:1, 2</h3>
<p>"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth
he meditate day and night."—Ps. i. 1, 2.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> It is blessed to read every portion of scripture
which speaketh of perfection in our nature, as referring to the person
of the God-man Christ Jesus; and then, from our union </span><span
class="c6">with </span><span class="c5">him, and interest </span><span
class="c6">in </span><span class="c5">him, to mark our connection as his
people, and our concern in all that is said or written of him. In the
book of Psalms, particularly, there are numberless passages, which say
that of holiness, which can be said of none among the fallen sons of men
with the smallest shadow of truth. Who is the man, and where to be
found, that hath never </span><span class="c6">walked </span><span
class="c5">in the counsel of the ungodly; nor yet, which is more than
walking, hath </span><span class="c6">stood, </span><span class="c5">as
one not distressed at it, in the way of sinners; nor yet </span><span
class="c6">sat down, </span><span class="c5">which is worse than all, in
the scorner's chair? None of the children of men could ever lay claim to
the blessedness of such a conduct from his own personal holiness in it.
But if we read the words with reference to the ever blessed and ever
holy Jesus, all this, and infinitely more, is true; for such was the
spotless purity of the Redeemer, that his whole nature was altogether
clean; yea," the law of Jehovah was in his very bowels." See the margin
of the bible, Ps. xl. 8. My soul! behold in this account, the true
character of thy Lord; and in it behold the holiness and purity of that
nature, in whose holiness and purity alone thou canst ever see the face
of God, in grace here by faith, and in glory hereafter by sight, in open
fruition. Thus read, and thus accepted, the passage in this Psalm
becomes blessed indeed. In his righteousness, his people are made
righteous; and by virtue of an union with him, and in-retest in him, and
in all that concerns him, being joined to the Lord by one spirit, the
souls of the redeemed walk as he walked, avoid the society of the
profane, and sit not in the counsel of the ungodly. Precious Spirit of
all truth! do thou thus glorify the Lord Jesus to my view; take of the
things of Christ, and shew them to me; and grant me daily fellowship and
communion with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ!</span></p>

10—Morning—Psalm 5:3</h3>
<p>"My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, Oh Lord! in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up." Ps. v. 3.</p>
<p>Sweet thought, my soul, to encourage thee this morning, that thy God
in Christ is a prayer-quickening, a prayer-hearing, and a
prayer-answering God. Art thou dull, dead, lifeless? One look from
Jesus, one influence of the Spirit, will kindle desire, and lead thee to
the mercy-seat, and to the throne of grace. Jesus will do more in one
moment, to call off thy wandering thoughts, to open to thy views his
glory, and to reveal to thee what thy wants are, and to give thee a
spirit of prayer suited to thy wants and his praise, than all thy
laboured attempts, without an eye to Jesus, can do for thee for ever.
Whence is it, my soul, that prayer is ever a burden, but because we have
lost a sight of Jesus? Why is it that thou art at times so little
affected with the remains of indwelling corruption, and canst neither
rightly value God's mercies, or be humbled under thine own infirmities?
Is it not because thou dost not look up, and behold Jesus in his
priestly vesture, waiting to be-gracious? Oh didst thou but eye thy God
and Saviour under this blessed character, how wouldest thou feel the
preciousness of his great salvation, and haste to unload thyself upon
the Lord Christ, and cast all thy burden of coldness, deadness, and sin
upon him who is mighty to save! Come, Lord, then, I pray thee, with all
thy sweet influences, fill my mouth with arguments, and my heart do thou
warm with love. I know, Lord, I shall surely speed this day, this
morning, at the mercy-seat, the moment thou hast loosed my tongue, and
enlarged my heart with thy grace. Yes, yes, blessed Jesus, my voice
shalt thou hear, my voice wilt thou hear in the morning; at the dawn of
day, before cock-crowing, I will direct my prayers to thee, I will send
them up to heaven; and through the day, and all the day, and seven times
a day, will I praise thee, Oh thou God of my salvation, when thou hast
caused me to praise thee with joyful lips.</p>

10—Evening—Luke 8:45, 46</h3>
<p>"And Jesus said, who touched me? When all denied, Peter, and they
that were with him, said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and press
thee, and sayest thou, who touched me? And Jesus said, somebody hath
touched me; for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."—Luke viii.
45, 46.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> What a most interesting passage is here! What an
evidence does it afford of the clear knowledge of the Lord Jesus; and,
by an undeniable conclusion from such a proof of his omniscience, what a
testimony does it bring with it of the Godhead of Christ! Pause, my
soul, over the portion, and mark it well. Next pass on to another sweet
improvement of it, and duly consider what a beautiful distinction is
here drawn between the violent pressure of the throng, and the gentle
touch of faith. Multitudes crowd to churches, and they hear of Jesus;
but the personal knowledge and enjoyment of the Lord Jesus, is this
touching him. Oh! for grace to have this right discrimination! It is
very easy to attend the means of grace, to hear or read the holy
scriptures; nay, to have a clear head knowledge of divine things, and
even to </span><span class="c6">press </span><span class="c5">after
information concerning Christ; but all these may be, and perhaps often
are void of that life-giving, life-imparting knowledge and enjoyment of
Christ in the soul, which is really touching Christ by faith, and
believing in him to the salvation of the soul. Once more, remark vet
farther, the knowledge Jesus hath of all the individual cases of his
afflicted people. He saw this poor woman amidst the whole crowd. He knew
her case, knew all that had passed. In the greatest throng, Jesus's eye
is upon each, and upon all. He knoweth what the needy require, and what
the secret sighs of his poor people express: and it is Jesus that
communicates virtue, grace, strength, comfort, and help, in all their
vast varieties. What a sweet thought is it then, my soul, for thee to go
in the greatest throng, as well as in the most secret retirement! Jesus
encourageth thy faith, bids thee come and touch the hem of his garment,
and, depend upon it, as in the instance of this poor woman, however
unobserved or unknown by others, his eye is upon thee for good. The
language of Jesus to every one of this description is, son! daughter!
"be of good cheer, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in
peace!"</span></p>

11—Morning—Jeremiah 31:14</h3>
<p>"And my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the
Lord."—Jer. xxxi. 14.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Examine thine heart, my soul, this morning, and see
whether this blessed promise is really and truly fulfilled in thy
experience. Art thou satisfied with Jehovah's goodness? Yes, if so be
thou hast so received that goodness as manifested and treasured up in
the person and work of Christ, and art so believing as to be living
wholly upon it. This is a grand thing to do; and when it comes to be
strictly enquired into, few, very few, are living so wholly upon it, and
so completely satisfied with it, as to be seeking for no additional
satisfaction elsewhere. Now, my soul, as there are but few that are so
fully satisfied with the Lord's goodness in every thing that concerns
salvation, both in providence and grace, let thy morning thoughts be
directed to see whether thou art one of that happy few. I will, for the
sake of shortening the inquiry, take up the subject from this ground;
that thou art satisfied thou hast an interest in Jesus. Thou hast a long
time since been driven by thy necessities to Christ as a complete
Saviour; and thou art resting all thy hopes, joys, and expectations,
upon his blood and righteousness. I will consider this point as fairly
and fully determined. Why then, perhaps, my soul, thou wilt say, is not
this to be satisfied with Jehovah's goodness? Alas, here is the great
defect of God's people! Though resting on this foundation, how often may
they find their hearts exercised with endless perplexities how
</span><span class="c6">this </span><span class="c5">grace is to be
improved, or how </span><span class="c6">that </span><span
class="c5">gift is to be employed. And according as it appears to their
view they have improved the </span><span class="c6">one, </span><span
class="c5">or employed the </span><span class="c6">other, </span><span
class="c5">their peace and comfort is proportioned. My soul, do you not
see that this is self-satisfaction, and not being satisfied with God's
goodness? This is setting up the comforts of Jesus's graces and Jesus's
gifts above the glorious author of those gifts and graces. To be really
satisfied with God's goodness, implies living upon that goodness; and
that is Christ himself. Living upon Jesus, acting faith upon Jesus,
perceiving all our fresh springs to be in Jesus, and therefore drawing
all from him. And, my soul, if thou art thus satisfied with God's
goodness, thou wilt find it is injurious to the comfort and blessedness
of this life of faith to be ever looking off Jesus to any thing his
grace and goodness worketh in thee, lest in the view of the work itself,
be it what it may, the source of that work is overlooked, and
self-satisfaction, instead of Christ-exalting, should creep into thy
soul. In every act, my soul, see to it then that all thy satisfaction is
in Jesus, as the goodness of Jehovah. Lord, fulfil this sweet promise,
and make me satisfied with thy goodness!</span></p>

11—Evening—Exodus 13:21, 22</h3>
<p>"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
go by day and night. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day,
nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people."—Exod. xiii.
21, 22.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, look back this evening to the church's
history in the wilderness, and behold how Jesus watched over his people
then as he doth now. Surely it is sweet, it is blessed, to mark the same
evidences of the Redeemer's love, and to observe, that in affection to
his people (as in person so in love) he is "the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever." Among many precious testimonies to this effect, that of
the pillar of the cloud by day, and of fire by night, in the camp of
Israel, is not the least. We are told in this scripture, that the Lord
was in this cloud; and another scripture confirms it, saying, that
Jehovah "spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar." It is wonderful to
conceive what effect must have been wrought on the minds of the people
by this constant display of the Lord's goodness. Contrary to all other
clouds, it was always stationary, always near the tabernacle, and acted
as the reverse of all other clouds, in that it shone bright by night,
and was dark as a cloud to obscure the sun's brightness and scorching
rays by day. Besides these and other wonderful properties, its movements
became the token for the camp of Israel to move, and when it rested, it
implied that Israel was to rest also. And thus, not for a short
transient march or two, not on any particular emergency, did it become
the guide and protection of Israel, for forty years together, until all
the people of God arrived in the promised land. Pause my soul, and
ponder over the grace of thy covenant God in Christ, in this standing
miracle; and when thou hast duly considered the wonderful subject, say,
was not Jesus then as much, in type and figure, preached to the church
of old, as he is now in sum and substance? Was the Lord veiled in a
cloud then, and hath he not since veiled himself in our flesh? Did he go
before the people then, and doth he not the same now? Was he stationary
then, that is, ever with them, and is he not with his people "always,
even unto the end of the world?" Was the cloud in the wilderness the
reverse of all other clouds, shining by night, but becoming a grateful
screen by day? And is not Jesus all this and more; shining most bright
upon his people when they are in darkness, and sheltering them when the
heat of persecution or distress is at the height? Did the cloud never
deport from the people during their forty years' journey through the
wilderness until they arrived at Canaan? And doth not our Lord go
before, and follow his redeemed, all the way of their pilgrimage, until
he hath brought them home safe to heaven? Oh! thou glorious, gracious,
great I AM! be thou, dearest Lord, still the light, the way, the truth,
and the life, to alt thy redeemed. And as now, since thou hast finished
redemption-work by thine open presence upon earth, in substance of our
flesh, and "washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purged
the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of
judgment, and by the spirit of burning:" do thou, Lord, fulfil that
sweet promise, and </span><span class="c6">"create </span><span
class="c5">upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her
assemblies, a cloud and a smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming
fire by night; for upon all the glory shall be a defence!" Isa. iv. 4,
5.</span></p>

12—Morning—Hebrews 11:13</h3>
<p>"And confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth."—Heb. xi. 13.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou also witnessed this confession before many
witnesses? See whether thou hast the same evidences they had. In the
first place, they were led to see that here they had no continuing city.
Sin, sorrow, sickness, death, inhabited this region. Every thing said to
them in that sweet voice of God, "Arise ye, and depart, for this is not
your rest, because it is polluted." What sayest thou, my soul, to this
first view of the subject? Look at it under another. Hast thou learnt,
and so learnt as to prize it, the blessedness of that promise, "there is
a rest that remaineth for the people of God?" What sayest thou to this
also, my soul? Dost thou see that Jesus is that rest, and is he the
object of thy desire in rest? For the prophet saith, "He is the rest
wherewith he will cause the weary to rest, and he is their refreshing."
Isa. xxviii. 12. Hast thou heard and welcomed his invitation?—"Come unto
me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest!"
Go one step further in the enquiry. Under these convictions of soul art
thou travelling the heavenly road, asking the way to Zion with thy face
thitherward, as a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth? Go further yet. Art
thou guided, as Israel was in the way, by the pillar of cloud by day,
and guarded by the pillar of fire by night? Art thou coming up out of
the wilderness of this world, leaning upon Jesus? Advance yet further in
the enquiry. While the Holy Ghost as the pillar of cloud is going before
thee, and thou art resting upon Jesus as thy staff and stay, knowest
thou God for thy Father, his word thy guide, his promises thy treasure,
his ordinances thine inns, not to dwell in, but like the wayfaring man
to tarry but for the night? And dost thou draw water with joy out of
those wells of salvation? Pause, my soul, as thou seekest answers to
these questions. knowest thou the difficulties of a wilderness
dispensation; and the sweets of those streams from that river which make
glad the city of God? Art thou like other travellers, sometimes enjoying
fine weather when Jesus's face, his love, his mercy, are all in view;
and sometimes walking in darkness, when storms of sin and Satan throw
clouds over the gracious prospect? More especially, art thou the scorn
and derision of the carnal? Do they make thee their subject of laughter,
and art thou the drunkard's song? And, lastly, to mention no more,
knowest thou, my soul, what it is sometimes to be discouraged by reason
of the way, while Satan would prompt thee to go back; but sweetly
constrained by Jesus's love, thou art still the patient follower of them
"who through faith and patience inherit the promises?" Hast thou, my
soul, these precious marks of the stranger and pilgrim upon earth? Oh
then, remember what is said of them to whom the Holy Ghost bears
testimony, and by thy covenant interest in Jesus behold thy vast
privilege in the same blessed promise; God is not ashamed to be called
their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>

12—Evening—Zephaniah 3:17</h3>
<p>"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty. He will save. He
will rejoice over thee with joy. He will rest in his love. He will joy
over thee with singing."—Zeph. iii. 17.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! look at this old testament promise,
through the medium of the new testament dispensation, and behold what a
cluster of rich blessings it contains; and which, like all the other
promises of the bible, is "yea and amen in Christ Jesus!" And observe
how it opens. The Lord thy God, that is, Jehovah in his threefold
character of person, in rich covenant engagements, is "in the midst of
thee;" hath set up his throne in Zion, and lives, and reigns, and
governs in the hearts of his redeemed. So said Jesus, and so that dear
Lord explained it in after ages: "If a man love me, he will keep my
words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make
our abode with him;" John xiv. 23. "I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even
the Spirit of truth;" John xiv. 16, 17. Mark these blessed, precious
truths, my soul, in the most lively characters, on thine heart; and
hence learn, that the Lord thy God, in covenant engagements, dwelleth in
the midst of his people, and in the hearts of his people; that, like the
sun at midday, in the centre of the heavens, he may enlighten, warm,
refresh, and give forth all his blessings to bless thee. Next mark what
the prophet saith of this covenant Lord God, who is in the midst of his
church and people: "He is mighty!" Shout aloud at this, my soul; for if
he be mighty, then he will support thy weakness, and subdue thy foes.
What can bear down, or destroy the soul, whom this mighty God upholds?
What shall arise to distress a child of God, as long as God is almighty?
And if he hath engaged to be for thee, who can dare to be against thee?
Sweet consideration! What signifies my weakness, while Christ is strong?
Yea, his strength will be made perfect in my weakness. Go on farther, my
soul, in looking over the many blessed things spoken of in this verse.
"He will save." Yea: he hath saved, and doth save, and will save. And
this is the very cause, the angel said, for which his name should be
called Jesus: for "he shall save his people from their sins." Matt. i.
21. Think of this, when at any time, sin or sorrow, trial or temptation,
would cast thee down. Jesus is still Jesus, still on his throne: yea,
thy Saviour. Amidst all thy changeableness, there is no change in him.
And observe yet farther, how the prophet chimes on those sweet words:
"He will rejoice over thee with joy: he will rest in his love: he will
joy over thee with singing." Pause, my soul, over this most gracious
account. Jesus not only saves, not only pardons, but he doth it as God,
as Jesus. It is his joy, his delight, his pleasure, to do so. As he
saith in another scripture, "Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them
good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly, with my whole heart,
and with my whole soul;" Jer. xxxii. 41. And as the poor timid believer,
from feeling such coldness and deadness, as at times he doth in himself
feel, is but too easily prevailed upon by the enemy, and by his own
unbelieving heart, to suppose the same of Jesus: that he might not give
way to this temptation, the Lord adds, "he will rest in his love:" will
abide in it unmoved, and without change; for, as he saith in another
scripture," the Lord God of Israel hateth putting away:" Mal. ii. 16.
Oh! what a multitude of sweet things are folded up in this verse! Jesus
rejoiceth over his people; yea, Jesus joys over them with singing.
</span><span class="c6">How </span><span class="c5">often have I seen,
in some lovely evening, like the present, that sweet bird of the air,
called the skylark, mount aloft from her nest, still looking at her
young as she ascends; and when advanced to her height, warbling in the
most delightful notes over her brood; until at length, with all the
rapidity of love, she darts down to cover, to feed, and to protect them
Thus, but in an infinitely higher degree, doth Jesus joy over his
children with singing, resting in his love; and is ever near, ever
mighty to defend, to bless, to keep, and to make happy, those who rest
in his strength; while he rests in his love, being their God, and they
his people.</span></p>

13—Morning—John 11:28</h3>
<p>" The master is come, and calleth for thee,"—John xi. 28.</p>
<p>My soul, mark how gracious the Lord is to his people in the special
and distinguishing tokens of his grace. Jesus doth not barely send his
gospel to the church, or house, or family; but he speaketh by the soft,
but powerful whispers of his love, to the individual soul. "To thee is
the word of his salvation sent." Hence the soul who feels the
sovereignty of his word in the constraining influences with which it is
accompanied, cries out, I shall never forget thy word, for by it thou
hast quickened me. But besides the calls of his grace in his house of
prayer, in how many Ways, and by what a variety of methods, is the Lord
Jesus calling upon his people. My soul, I hope that thou art always upon
the look out, and art getting to thy watch-tower to hear what the Lord
thy God hath to say to thee, by his word, by his providences, his
chastisements in love, and in all the gracious manifestations of his
favour. Behold, he saith, "I stand at the door and knock." So Jesus
calleth, and so let my soul hear. Now, Lord, thou art calling me by thy
word and providence in a way of grace: by and by I shall hear thy voice
in the hour of death and judgment. And who shall say how very powerful,
sweet, and gracious, that call is, when Jesus cometh to take his people
home to himself, that where he is, there they may be also? 'I hear my
Master's voice,' said a highly favoured servant of God in the moment of
his departure. Perhaps a loud voice, a glorious distinguishable voice,
to him that is called, when no stander by is at all conscious of the
sound. Hence another said, when he was dying, 'I shall change my place,
but not my company.' Jesus, master, in that hour be it my happiness to
say, "let me hear thy voice, let me see thy countenance: for sweet is
thy voice, and thy countenance is comely."</p>

13—Evening—Hebrews 9:4</h3>
<p>"The golden pot that had manna."—Heb. ix. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> There is somewhat very blessed in the </span><span
class="c6">account </span><span class="c5">given concerning the
furniture of the second tabernacle. Some few evenings since, my soul, a
glance was taken of the candlestick, the table and shew-bread; in the
first tabernacle. Perhaps the Lord the Holy Ghost will open to thy
meditation some edifying considerations in the view of the contents of
the second. The golden pot, which preserved the manna pure, that in
itself was soon subject to corruption, was unquestionably a beautiful
emblem of the divine nature of Jesus, imparting durableness and dignity
to his human nature. We are told concerning the manna, that if the
Israelites kept it, though but for a day (except when miraculously
preserved pure on the sabbath-day, to remind them of that ordinance) it
bred worms, and stank; Exod. xvi. 20. But in this golden pot, an omer
full of manna put therein, was laid up before the Lord as a memorial,
and preserved pure. Precious Lord Jesus! do I not learn from hence, that
it is thou, and thou alone, who givest life, and purity, and sweetness
to our poor persons and offerings? Every thing in us, and groin us,
must, like ourselves, be corrupt, and is indeed part of ourselves, and
subject to putrefaction: but in thee, and by thee, as the manna was
preserved in the golden pot, we are preserved, made clean and holy, in
thy holiness and purity. And surely, Lord, I learn, moreover, from this
part of the furniture in the second tabernacle, that as thou art entered
into the holy place, there to appear in the presence of God for us; so,
by this emblem of the golden pot, is set forth the sweet communion and
fellowship, which thy people now are privileged to enjoy, in thee, and
from thee, and with thee! Yea, Lord, thou art still the bread of God,
the living bread, which that manna represented: and still dost thou feed
thy church above, and lead them to fountains of living waters. And
surely, Lord, thou wilt no less feed thy church below, which yet remains
in this dry and barren wilderness, where no water is. I hear what the
Spirit saith unto the churches, and I feel delight: "To him that
overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna." Rev. ii.

14—Morning—Song of Solomon 8:5</h3>
<p>"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
beloved."—Song viii. 5.</p>
<p>Who is it that asketh this question, my soul? Is it the holy angels,
astonished as they well may, at the gracious condescension of thy Jesus
in the grace and favour he hath bestowed upon thee? Or is it the world
at large, looking on with amazement at the love of Jesus to his chosen?
Is it the Jewish church, amazed that Gentiles should be fellow heirs,
and of the same body, and partakers of God's promise in Christ? Or,
above all, is it Jesus himself, not because be knoweth not the grace he
hath bestowed, but because he admireth the grace he hath given, and as
he did the centurion's faith which he himself was the author of, he
looketh upon it with pleasure? And art thou, my soul, come up from the
wilderness of nature, a dry, barren land, where no water of life is;
from the wilderness of the world, and from all the unsatisfying and
empty pursuits of it? Art thou leaning upon thy Jesus, cleaving to him,
hanging upon him, strengthening thyself upon him, determining, like
another Ruth, concerning Naomi, where Jesus goeth thou wilt go, and
where he lodgeth thou wilt lodge? Is this thy conduct, and dost thou
rest the whole stress of thy present and everlasting happiness upon his
glorious person and righteousness? If so, angels may well look on, and
cry out, who is this to whom the Father of all mercies hath been so
gracious; to whom Jesus hath manifested his love, otherwise than he doth
to the world; and on whom the Spirit hath shed his blessed influence to
make thee willing in the day of his power? Yes, precious Jesus, I would
come up from every thing near and dear in this wilderness state, forget
mine own people, and my father's house; I would lean wholly upon thy
glorious person for my acceptance before God: lean wholly upon thy
righteousness, as all-sufficient for my justification. I would lean upon
thy fulness, day by day, for the supply of all grace here; and I would
lean solely upon the divine efficacy and blessedness of thy blood to
cleanse my soul for everlasting fitness for happiness hereafter. Witness
for me, ye angels of light, that this is my beloved on whom I lean, and
in whom I trust, and desire to be found in, for time and for eternity.
Amen.</p>

<p>"Aaron's rod that budded."—Heb. ix. 4.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> One view more of the tabernacle, and the articles
of furniture therein contained, may be rendered profitable, under the
Spirit's teaching: and therefore, my soul, look at that standing
miracle, which was preserved there, of the rod of Aaron. The history of
it is related in the book of Numbers, chap. xvii. It was</span><span
class="c7"> </span><span class="c5">the method, which the Lord was
graciously pleased to appoint, for the determining on whom his choice
rested for the priesthood. To this end, a rod was taken from every
tribe, and laid up before the Lord</span><span class="c6"> </span><span
class="c5">in the tabernacle; the Lord having declared, that whichsoever
of the tribes had the rod to blossom, should be the man. The rod of
Aaron, on the morrow, had buds, and blossoms, and fruits. But in all
these, Christ, in his everlasting priesthood, was typified. To behold a
dry stick bring forth buds, and become green and flourishing, was
miraculous, and only to be referred into the sore-reign power and will
of God. But, my soul, when we see Jesus, as the branch out of the root
of Jesse, we behold him, as the prophet, ages before his incarnation,
described him, growing up before Jehovah in his tabernacle, as the rod
laid up before him, "a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground."
Isa. iiii. 2. And as the rod of Aaron had in one and the same moment the
whole product of the season in buds, and blossoms, and fruits; so in the
everlasting priesthood of Christ are suited graces for the several ages
of his church, and the several wants of all his people. Precious Jesus!
may my soul unceasingly look unto thee, as my faithful, everlasting, and
unchangeable High Priest! And do thou, Lord," send the rod of thy
strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies!" Full
sure I am, O Lord, that every thing in me, and from me, like the rods of
the different tribes of Israel, will remain dry, and neither give forth
bud nor blossom. To thee, and the rod of thy strength, therefore, will I
look, that thou mayest give life and grace to my poor soul, to bring
forth fruit unto God, by grace here, and glory for ever,</span></p>

15—Morning—Galatians 4:28</h3>
<p>"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."—Gal.
iv. 28.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, the distinguishing characters of those who are the
children of promise, and see whether thou art of this blessed family.
For as the law and the gospel are strikingly distinguished from each
other, so are the children of nature from those of grace. And how is
this to be known? Look at the case Paul hath referred to: Isaac was the
son of Abraham. And the apostle saith, "that they which are of faith,
the same are children of Abraham. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." And as Isaac was a
child of Abraham by promise, not by natural power, so believers in Jesus
are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God. Hence Paul saith, "to Abraham and his seed were the
promises made. He saith not to seeds as of many, but as of one; and to
thy seed, which is Christ." Precious truth! The children, of promise are
of Jesus; for he himself is the one great promise of the bible. So that
from everlasting they are the seed of Christ: their being, their well
being, their everlasting being, all are folded up in Jesus, as the oak
in all its foliage is contained and folded up in the first and original
acorn. Hence they are spiritually begotten, born, nourished, fed,
sustained, led, strengthened, and carried on, through all the gradations
of grace, until grace is consummated in the ripeness of their full
stature in glory. My soul, art thou, as Isaac was, a child of promise?
Oh live by faith on Jesus, and in Jesus, and see to it, in all thy
daily, hourly exercises and experiences, that all the promises of God in
Christ Jesus are yea and amen, unto the glory of God the Father.</p>

15—Evening—Psalm 2:6, 7</h3>
<p>"Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the
decree."—Ps. ii. 6, 7.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Here is a subject, my soul, opened for thy
meditation, which neither the evening nor day of thy whole life, no, nor
eternity itself, will ever be long enough to exhaust. Some of the
outlines may be gathered here below, when God the Holy Ghost condescends
to teach; but the subject itself will, no doubt, be among the glorious
employments of heaven. It should seem, that the divine speakers here are
God the Father and God the Son. We find similar instances in the word of
God: see Isa. vi. and xlix. John xii. 27, 28. And the beloved apostle
was led into an apprehension of the same subject, for the church's
instruction, in that vision he saw, Rev. v. 1-9. In this vision, Jesus
is represented as taking the book, and opening it, and declaring the
contents of it. Hence, therefore, when God the Father saith, as in this
Psalm, "I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion;" Jesus, as King,
declares </span><span class="c6">the decree </span><span class="c5">of
the council of peace, which was between them both, for the salvation of
his church and people. And what was the decree, but the decree from all
eternity; namely, that Jehovah would give a church to his dear Son, and
his dear Son to the church: that Jesus should take the name of his
people, and their nature; become their glorious Head and Representative;
redeem them from the ruins of the fall, and make them altogether
glorious and lovely, from his comeliness that he would put upon them?
Upon Christ's thus undertaking the salvation of his people, "the decree
went forth," that all power should be his, as Mediator, in heaven and in
earth. It began from everlasting: for from everlasting, by this decree,
Jesus was set up as the glorious Head and Mediator before all worlds.
The same power became his in time; and the same power is his to all
eternity. Hence, therefore, Jesus is no sooner seated on his throne, on
his holy hill of Zion, but he sends forth the decree; and God the Father
confirms the whole, in giving him "the heathen for his inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession." Hail then, thou
sovereign Lord! thou almighty King, upon thy holy hill of Zion! Gladly
do I acknowledge thee to be my King and my God; for by Jehovah's
appointment, by thy conquest of my heart, and by the voluntary surrender
of myself since thou hast brought me under the power of thy grace, am I
thine, and no longer my own. Oh! for grace so to acknowledge thee, so to
obey thee, so to love thee, that while the Lord Jehovah hath set thee
upon thy throne, his grace also may give thee the throne of my heart!
And while all thine enemies must bow before thee, may all thy friends
and followers rejoice in thy service! Even so, Amen.</span></p>

16—Morning—Isaiah 40:11</h3>
<p>"He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
bosom."—Isa. xl. 11.</p>
<p>My soul, mark in this sweet scripture how Jesus is described, in not
only attending to all the various wants of his fold, but to the very
method of imparting to their several wants in a way corresponding to his
own character and their state. In the fold of Jesus, like the sheepfold
among men, some are sheep and some are lambs: some of advanced age, and
some of younger standing. Well, where will Jesus put the lambs and the
weaklings of his fold? Certainly, if there be one place in the heart of
Jesus softer and more tender than another, there the lambs shall lay.
And as Jesus himself lay in the bosom of his Father, so the lambs of his
flock shall lay in his bosom. Sweet thought to encourage thee, my soul,
and all the followers of Christ! Jesus will not thrust out the lambs
into the dangers of the wilderness, where the prowling beasts of prey
are, nor expose them to over-driving, or the speed with which the more
mature sheep can travel. But he will proportion their burden to their
back, and their day to their strength. And besides this, he will keep
them nearer to himself; his arms shall clasp them; the warmth of his
bosom shall nourish them; if they cannot walk they shall be carried; and
when they cannot find their way, they shall be led. Oh thou great
Shepherd of thy sheep, is it thus thou sweetly dealest with thy little
ones? Hence I see then explained why it is that young believers, in the
first seasons of their knowledge of thee, find so many blessed
refreshings, which they afterwards do not so sensibly enjoy. Yes, Lord,
it is thus thou gatherest the lambs and carriest them in thy bosom. And
sweetly and seasonably dost thou do all this, and in a way which fully
proves thy love and compassion to the necessities of thy flock.</p>

<p>"Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
turtle, and the crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their
coming: but my people know not the judgment of the Lord."—Jer. viii.
7.</p>
<p>When the Lord would expostulate with his people, what methods he
graciously adopts! There are no creatures in nature so dull, so
senseless, and stupid, as God's people are, by reason of the fall. Every
animal hath an instinct, prompting to self-preservation. Arc they
exposed to danger? how speedily do they endeavour to remove! Are they
apprehensive of a storm? they flee to some covering to hide them! The
birds of passage, when the first symptoms of winter appear, gather
together, to depart to a warmer climate. But man, poor blind improvident
man, no winter of death can admonish him; no approach of the departing
day of life can prevail, to induce him to flee from the wrath to come.
My soul! look round on human life, and mark this, by way of admiring,
more and more, distinguishing grace, which enabled thee to estimate thy
privileges, and discern that sovereign bountiful mercy, which maketh
thee to differ from another. "What hast thou, which thou didst not
receive?" But, dearest Lord, is it not to copy after that gracious
feeling of thine, which thou hadst in the days of thy flesh, when thou
hadst compassion on the multitude, in beholding them famishing, and wast
moved in pity towards them; when we behold the great mass of thoughtless
sinners, whose concern for self-preservation doth not come up to that of
the brute which perisheth? In common life, all are interested, and
earnest in the pursuit of the different objects of the world: the
traveller is full of thought, in his way home, to see that his path be
right; the marl-net would not run contrary to the direction of the
compass; the man of trade never acts in opposition to the gain of that
trade; neither does the man of pleasure lose sight of what will most
likely promote that pleasure. But thy people, blessed Jesus, are
everlastingly pursuing what they have proved a thousand times to be vain
and unsatisfying; yet they pursue it again, and do not learn "to know
the judgment of the Lord." Blessed Lord! undertake for me: pity,
compassionate, direct, guide, keep me! Oh! for grace to learn, and
rightly to value the things of salvation! And, convinced that Christ is
all and in all, may I never seek from the creature what only can be
found in the Creator! And having discovered the vanity of every thing
out of Christ, may I, where Christ is not, from henceforth learn, with
the church to say, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none
upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee: my flesh and my heart
faileth: but thou art the strength of my heart and my portion for
ever!"</p>

<p>"He restoreth my soul."—Ps. xxiii. 3.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord, it is indeed thou that bringest back the strayed sheep;
for as no man ever quickened, so none can keep alive his own soul. It
was indeed thy promise, and most graciously dost thou fulfil it!—"As a
shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep, so
will I seek out my sheep, and bring again that which was driven away."
Ezek. xxxiv. 11-16. My soul, mark this trait of character in thy Jesus
for thy morning meditation. It is well for thee that restoring work,
reclaiming work, reviving work, all is with Jesus; begins in him, and is
carried on and completed by him, and through his grace in thee. And it
is well for thee, my soul, that though thou so often failest in all
things towards thy Jesus, yet he never faileth in his love to thee in
any thing. Sweet consideration! his love, and not thy deserts, become
the standard for all his tenderness to his people. And mark it down, my
soul, in strong characters, that Jesus's grace is much shewn this way.
He doth not wait our return, for then we should never return at all;
neither doth he wait our cry for help, but he puts that cry into the
soul. Alas, how often have we wandered and gone away, even before that
we were sensible of our departure. How blessed is it then to see and
know that Jesus's eye is upon us, and that before we return to him, he
is coming forth to us. His love, his pity, his compassion, are the
security of his people's recovery. Yes, Lord, it is thou that restorest
my soul. Praises to thy name, for thou doest it all in such a way as
proves it to be for thy great name's sake, that thy grace comes freely
and without upbraiding. "He restoreth my soul, and leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness for his name's sake."</p>

times to go down to the grave in </span><span class="c6">imagination,

thou mayest consider what will be the immediate consequences of death in
those things which are now most about thee, and with which thou art

inhabitants of the world:" would it not be proper, therefore, to wean
thyself from too great an acquaintance with them now, that the
separation may be the less felt? Thou wilt be called upon to enter upon
a state altogether new, and a path thou hast never before trodden; and
would it not be wise to send forth enquiries concerning them, such as
scripture gives the clearest answer to, and study the best way to make
preparation in Jesus for thy change? What a blessed example hath the
apostle Paul left upon record of his conduct in this particular; "I
protest," said he to the Corinthian church, speaking on this subject,
"by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily,"
1 Cor. xv. 31. Such were both the habitual and actual frames of Paul's
mind, that he was every day, and all the day, waiting and looking for
his Master's call. The fact was, he knew the certainty of the ground on
which he stood; he had no farther questions to ask concerning his safety
in Christ; and therefore, he rather wished to bring the hour on, than to
put it off. His whole heart, his whole affections, centered in Christ;
and as such, though to live was Christ, yet to die was gain. My soul,
what sayest thou to this blessed frame? Oh! for the same earnestness,
and from the same cause; that whether this night, or at cock-crowing, or
in the morning, when the Lord comes, though thou wilt behold man no more
with the inhabitants of the world, yet thou wilt behold the face of God
in glory; and when thou awakest after his likeness, thou wilt be

<p>"To him whom man despiseth; to him whom the nation abhorreth."—Isa.

<p>My soul, let thy longing eyes be directed to him this day whom man
despiseth, and whom God honoureth, and to whom he hath given a name
above every name. Pause, in the contemplation of the wonderful mystery.
Was Jesus indeed despised, and by the very creature he came to redeem?
Did angels hail his wonderful incarnation, and man despise, hate, and
abhor him? "Be astonished, O ye heavens; and wonder, O earth!" But, my
soul, go further in the contemplation of this mysterious subject. What
man, what individual man, was it that could thus requite the
unparalleled love of Jesus? Alas, not an individual only, but a whole
nation; nay, the whole nature, both Jew and Gentile abhorred him; for
while in a state of unrenewed nature, to the one he is a
stumbling-block, and to the other his cross is foolishness. Ah, is it
so, my soul? Why then it follows, that thou, even thou, my soul, wert
once in the same state of hatred, and wert by nature, as well as others,
a child of wrath, despising this wisdom of God in Christ for the
salvation of sinners. And art thou then, my soul, recovered by almighty
sovereign grace from this deadly hatred of nature, and dost thou look
this day with love, with joy, with rapture, and unspeakable delight to
him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth? Is Jesus
indeed lovely, the altogether lovely to thy view? Is he precious, nay,
infinitely more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir? Yes, thou Holy
One of God, thou art the all in all to my soul. Witness for me, O ye
saints that are now around his throne, that I have none in heaven or in
earth that I desire besides him. My whole soul desires to know him, to
follow hard after him, to trust in him, to cleave to him, to hang upon
him, and to accept and receive him, and to make use of him as the wisdom
of God, and the power of God, for salvation to my soul, as he is to
every one that believeth. Oh ye sons of men, who are still in the
unrenewed hatred of your heart, in your hatred against the precious
Christ of God, what will ye do when he whom ye now despise shall come to
your everlasting shame? Well might the apostle echo the words of the
prophet, for from age to age the astonishing truth remaineth! "Behold,
ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a
work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto

Peter 1:2</h3>
<p>"Elect, according to fore-knowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ."—I Pet. i. 2.</p>
<p>Of all blessings, surely this is the highest, and the best, which
holds forth to a poor sinner the assurance of redemption, as the united
result of the love, grace, and mercy of all the persons in the Godhead.
My soul, pause over the glorious truth, and sweetly mark the testimony
of each cooperating and acting together in the great work of salvation.
Behold thy God and Father setting apart, from all eternity, the chosen
vessels of mercy, foreknowing and fore-appointing every event, in his
own counsel, purpose, and will. What a blessed thought, in the mind of
the redeemed, is this, to live upon, to cherish, and keep alive in the
soul, from day to day, to call up the unceasing fruits of adoration,
love, duty, and praise, in grace here, and in glory to all eternity. Go
on, my soul, to the contemplation of the second chapter in his holy
volume of grace and mercy; and mark what the apostle hath here said of
"the sanctification of the Spirit." So that the blessed hand of the Holy
Ghost is as much engaged in this beneficent act of redemption, in the
existence of every individual, as the foreknowledge and appointment of
God the Father, or of the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ. Yea, all the glory of redemption, in the grace provided by the
Father, and the merits of the Son's blood and righteousness, depend, for
the personal enjoyment of it, in the case of each believer, upon the
Holy Ghost's revelation of it in the soul. Oh! it is blessed to see, to
feel, to know, and to enjoy those gracious communications of God's
Christ in the soul, which God the Holy Ghost awakens, and excites, and
brings home to the mind. And no less, as the meritorious cause of all,
(the third chapter in this wonderful volume) do thou contemplate, my
soul, the two united branches of thy redemption; the obedience, and
atonement in the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. How
comprehensive, yet how full and satisfactory! It is Jesus, as God's
righteous servant, who, by his perfect obedience hath justified his
people. And it is the death of the cross which hath fully atoned for
their transgression; "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin."
Behold then, my soul, in these three glorious chapters of redemption how
all the great charter of grace is summed up and contained. Take it with
thee as thine evening portion; let it lie down with thee, and arise with
thee; and carry it about with thee, for thine unceasing meditation
during the whole of thy day of grace, until grace is swallowed up in
eternal glory!</p>

19—Morning—Ecclesiastes 9:7</h3>
<p>"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
heart; for God now accepteth thy works."—Eccles. ix. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, here is a sweet subject for thy morning thoughts. Art thou
accepted in the Beloved? Hast thou accepted Jesus, and God accepted thee
in Jesus? Well mayest thou then eat of the bread of common providences,
and drink of the sweet of all sanctified mercies, for every thing is
blessed in Jesus, and Jesus is blessing thee in every thing. Surely an
accepted soul is a blessed soul, for he is blessed in his basket and in
his store; blessed in his lying down, and blessed in his rising up;
blessed in his going out, and blessed in his coming home; yea, blessed
in time, and blessed to all eternity. Yes, thou blessed Source of all my
blessedness, thou precious Jesus, I will go my way, for thou art my way;
I will eat my bread with joy, for thou art my bread of life; I will
drink the wine which thou hast mingled for me, for thy love is better
than wine. And as God my Father accepteth me in thee, this forms an
everlasting cause of everlasting joy; joy in what I have; joy in what I
expect; joy in even what I want, for those very wants will lead me the
closer and the nearer to thee; joy in what I fear, for my fear will keep
me depending upon thee; joy in what I suffer, for my sufferings are
sweetly blessed when they afford a renewed occasion for my Jesus to
soothe me under them, and in his time to deliver me out of them; and joy
in all I lose, for lose what I may I cannot lose thee, I cannot lose
God's Christ; I cannot lose his love, his favour, his grace, his Spirit,
the efficacy of his blood, and the merits of his righteousness. Oh
precious security, precious salvation in the Lord our Righteousness!
Shall I not then live up to this heritage, and live under its influence,
in the thankful, joyful use of it from day to day? Go thy way, my soul,
go in Jesus as thy way; every day, and all the day, eat thy bread with
joy; eye Jesus as the spiritual food, and always present at thy table;
drink hourly of his cup of salvation, with a cheerful heart, for thou
art accepted in the Beloved.</p>

19—Evening—Psalm 57:7</h3>
<p>"My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give
praise."—Psalm lvii. 7.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! here is a delightful subject proposed for
thine evening meditation, in the fixedness of the heart. The only
possible way of really "singing and giving praise to the Lord" with the
heart, is when the Lord</span><span class="c6"> </span><span
class="c5">hath fixed thine heart to the service. Many rush to
ordinances, as the unthinking horse rusheth to the battle: not so, my
soul, be thy practice. See to it, that He who alone can give a fixedness
to the heart, hath fixed thine; for then, when the view of a God in
Christ is brought home by the Holy Ghost to thy warmest and most devout
affections, then, and not before, will there be a going forth of those
affections, awakened and led by the same Almighty Spirit, upon the
glorious person of thy Lord, and faith will be in lively exercise, in a
way of praise, and love, and obedience, and joy. Then thou wilt sing and
give praise "with the spirit, and with the understanding also." Sit down
now, in the coolness of this sweet summer evening, and wait upon thy
Jesus in silence and in meditation before him, until the Lord hath given
thee this fixedness of affection on his person and righteousness; and
then thou wilt find a fitness </span><span class="c6">for</span><span
class="c5"> devotion, and a fitness </span><span
class="c6">in</span><span class="c5"> devotion, from the sweet
influences of God the Holy Ghost. Oh! how blessed is it to retire from
every eye but his, who seeth in secret; and to remember, that while
thine eye is looking upon Him, he is ever looking upon thee! Such a
thought as this begins to give a fixedness to the heart; for the whole
current and stream of the affections are directed, and therefore pour in
to this one channel; so that, like a river not divided, nothing of it
runs another way. And when the full tide of thine affections is thus
tending to the person of Jesus, shall not such a fixedness of thought
make thee cry out, as David, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
fixed; I will sing and give praise?" It is this state of the heart,
which makes all the difference between the gracious and the carnal. Both
may use closet duties; both may read, yea, study the word; yea, become
proficients in the outer understanding of the word; the meditation may
furnish the head, but not feed the heart: but it is the gracious soul
that enjoys. It is a solemn consideration, how many are employed from
year to year, in </span><span class="c6">spiritual </span><span
class="c5">things, whose hearts all the while remain </span><span
class="c6">carnal. </span><span class="c5">But where there is a
fixedness of the heart, by the Spirit of the living God, upon the
person, offices, and character of the Lord Jesus Christ, the meditation
doth not settle for the mere discharge of a duty, but for the joy of the
soul. Oh how I love thy law!"</span><span class="c6"> </span><span
class="c5">is then the language of the fixed heart; "it is my meditation
all the day." My soul, dost thou know these things by heartfelt
testimony? Doth God the Holy Ghost shine in upon thee with his light, to
give thee sweet views, engaging views, soul-arresting views of Jesus?
Are thine eyes, I mean the whole affections of thy soul, fixing
themselves on Jesus, as a longing woman fixeth upon the one object of
her desire, which nothing beside can satisfy? Oh! it is blessed to have
this fixedness of mind at all times upon the person of Jesus. For this
is to enter into the heart, and to shut to the door, (as Christ
expresseth it) by shutting out all thoughts besides, and then looking in
every direction for Jesus, and finding him in all, and upon all. His
word, his grace, his secret whispers, his communications, are like so
many rich cabinets of jewels, which the soul turns over, and finds Jesus
in every one. Oh! thou dear Lord Jesus! grant me this happy frame of
mind, that I may say, with David, "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is
fixed; I will sing and give praise!"</span></p>

<p>"Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
Amen."—Eph. vi. 24.</p>
<p>And dost thou, my soul, with the same affection and love as the
apostle, bend thy knee this morning before His throne, of whom the whole
family in heaven and earth are named? Dost thou look up, and pray that
all grace may abound? Oh what a delightful thought is it, my soul, to
warm thy affections, that in the moment thou art waiting at the
mercy-scat, thousands are waiting also for the morning blessing. Go
then, my soul, and tell thy Redeemer this; tell him that he hath all
suited grace, and that the eyes of his redeemed, as the eyes of one man,
are all directed towards him. Yes, thou glorious, rich, and gracious
Saviour, we do behold thee still as the Lamb in the midst of the throne,
leading thy church which is above in glory to fountains of living
waters. And, Lord, we know that thou art equally attentive to thy church
in the dry and barren wilderness here below, where no waters are.
Vouchsafe, blessed Lord, to supply each soul. Thou hast every grace, and
all grace, suited to all wants; grace to pardon, grace to save, grace to
renew, grace to strengthen, grace to bless. Oh Lord, awaken, convince,
humble, comfort, and pour out of thy fulness as our several necessities
may be, in calling, cleansing, justifying, adopting, sanctifying, and
building up thine household, that all grace may abound, according to
God's riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Oh ye attendants at the heavenly
gate, see that ye come not empty away. Remember Jesus is on the throne;
eye him there. Behold, the very grace you need is in his hand; read the
love that is in his heart, and remember that he hath not only the very
grace you need, but every grace, and every mercy for all that wait upon
him. Tell every poor sinner this, and bid him ask in faith, nothing
doubting. Tell all you know, and all you meet, and all you see, that He
who is on the throne hath abundant grace, and wants vessels, the empty
vessels of his people, to give out into: tell them that his grace
exceeds all sense of grace, all thoughts, all prayers, all praises, all
desires; nay, that he hath exceeding abundantly above all that they can
ask or think. Behold, then, O Lord, thy children, thy redeemed, thy
family, and let all grace be with all them, and upon all them that love
thee in sincerity. Amen.</p>

20—Evening—Ephesians 3:8</h3>
<p>"Unto me who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
given."—Ephes. iii. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, hear what the great apostle to the gentiles speaks of
himself. He calls himself "less than the least;" a thing almost
impossible in itself; but he doth it with a view to magnify the riches,
the exceeding great riches of grace. And in the same moment that he
views himself so low and abject, he is lost in amazement at beholding
the exalted office to which he was called. So that Paul cries out, "Unto
me," a poor, sinful, unworthy creature of the earth, "to me was this
grace given!" My soul, leave for a moment the view of the apostle, and
make the subject personal, by looking to a renewed instance of that
grace, most freely given, in a case as far surpassing Paul in the
greatness and undeservedness of it, as the imagination can conceive.
Perhaps every sinner feels the same; this at least is certain, all may
well feel the same. But the subject is not properly improved, either in
the apostle's instance, or any other, unless there be connected with it
the one great object of the whole, the promotion of the Redeemer's
glory. This was and is the first and ultimate design for which grace was
given. "This people," saith Jehovah, speaking of the redeemed in Christ,
"have I formed for myself, they shall shew forth my praise." Isa. xliii.
21. And how do they shew forth the Lord's praise, but by the gifts of
the Lord's grace? When Jesus calleth a poor sinner, and manifests
himself to him, this is the display of his grace; for it is on such more
especially, that he maketh his grace to shine. It would have been no
grace had we merited his favour. But because we merit nothing, yea, are
justly entitled to punishment, and yet God gives mercy, grace, and
favour; this is what illustrates the exceeding riches of his grace, and
demonstrates God's love to be indeed the love of God which passeth
knowledge, because it differs altogether from creature love. And what
tends yet more to display the riches of grace, that the glory of God in
Christ, in following up the blessed plan of redemption, may be great
indeed, the crown of Jesus, as Mediator, depends upon bringing to glory
the objects of his love, on whom he hath made that grace to shine. And
who shall calculate the rich revenue of love, adoration, and praise, in
glory, which Jesus will have, and be for ever receiving, from the
millions of redeemed souls gathered from sin and Satan, by the alone
sovereignty of his grace? My soul, it is truly blessed thus to
contemplate the person and work of Jesus, and the sweet effects of his
grace. And what an addition to the subject is it, to say, with the
apostle, each poor sinner for himself, "Unto me, who am less than the
least of all saints, is this grace given!"</p>

21—Morning—Zechariah 3:8</h3>
<p>"Men wondered at."—Zech. iii. 8.</p>
<p>Men wondered at indeed, and every redeemed soul may truly say, I am a
wonder unto many, a wonder to myself. Oh thou whose name is Wonderful!
both thou and the children the Lord hath given thee, are for signs and
wonders. Behold, my soul, how it was fulfilled in him whose name was
Wonderful, and then thine astonishment will be the less that it should
be fulfilled in his followers. I would contemplate thy person, blessed
Jesus, and behold thee, not barely wondered at, but despised and
rejected of men. The world gazed at thee, but saw no beauty nor form of
comeliness in thee to desire thee. In thine offices also, how did the
multitude despise thee as a prophet; when blind-folding thee, and
smiting thee on thy sacred head, they tauntingly cried out, "Prophecy,
thou Christ, who is he that smote thee!' As a priest, what blasphemy did
they utter, when they saw enough to be convinced, and to confess, that
thou didst save others, but thyself thou couldst not save. As a King,
when having nailed thee to the tree, they demanded a proof of thy power
in coming down from the cross. And wert thou not, blessed Jesus,
wondered at in thy word, when they acknowledged, "never man spake like
this man;" yet charged thy doctrines with blasphemy, and derided thee in
them? Wert thou not the wonder and the hatred of the world, when thy
miracles astonished them, but were ascribed to the agency of Beelzebub?
Weft thou not, O thou spotless Lamb of God, weft thou not charged with
immorality and called a wine-bibber, a sabbath-breaker, the friend of
publicans and sinners? Did the world thus treat Jesus, and call the
Master of the house Beelzebub? Oh then, my soul, well may they so treat
them of his household! And must it not be so? Yes. The world knoweth
them not, because it knew him not. They are made a spectacle, a
gazing-stock, a reproach, a by-word. How unknown in their new birth from
God, how little understood in their union with Jesus, how perfectly
hidden from the world their life in the Spirit! What an everlasting
opposition to carnal men are their pursuits, their pleasures, their
happiness, their conversation, their desires—how wondered at their life
of faith on the Son of God! They have meat to eat the world knoweth
nothing of, for they feed upon the person, body, blood, grace, and
righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ. My soul, hast thou this rarity
of charactery Hast thou this blessed singularity? Art thou wondered at
because thou runnest not to the same excess of riot, but art blameless
and harmless among the sons of God, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse generation? Oh blessed, for ever blessed, be his name, who hath
called thee to this high, this glorious, this distinguishing honour, of
being wondered at and reproached for Jesus's sake! Yes, Lord, I will not
regard the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings, for
"the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them
like wool; but thy righteousness shall be for ever, and thy salvation
from generation to generation."</p>

21—Evening—John 4:29</h3>
<p>"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not
this the Christ?"—John iv. 29.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Those are sweet and blessed views of the Lord
Jesus, which he himself gives, when, by letting the poor sinner see
himself, how wretched he is, and at the same time how glorious the Lord
is, and how exactly suited to his wants and necessities, he makes the
soul cry out, as this woman of Samaria did," Is not this the Christ?"
For who but Christ can read the heart, and tell all that passeth there?
And as she found it, so all taught of Jesus find the same, that every
true discovery of Christ must end in condemning ourselves, and exalting
the Redeemer. My soul! there are numberless instructions to be gathered
from this scripture, and the history connected with it. Sit down, this
evening, in the coolness of the shade, and look at a few of them. The
Lord the Holy Ghost will open them to thy meditation. Jesus, we are
told, "must needs go through Samaria." Yes; there was this poor sinner
to be convinced of sin, and to be brought acquainted with her Saviour.
Hence the opportunity soon offered; and Jesus as soon accomplished the
purpose of his going thither. The Lord opened her heart to her own view,
and gave her to see the vileness within. He opened, at the same time,
her heart to the knowledge of himself, gave her to see his salvation;
and the effects were as might have been expected: she hastened to the
city, to tell other poor sinners, who also stood in need of a Saviour,
that she had found </span><span class="c6">"him </span><span
class="c5">of whom Moses and the prophets did write." Come, said she
"see a man, which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the
Christ?" My soul! hast thou so learned Christ? Hast thou "met with the
Lord God of the Hebrews," and learned from him self-humbling thoughts,
and a true conviction of sin? Hath he taught thee who he is, and what
need thou hast of him? Hast thou seen him to be indeed the Christ of
God; the man, whose name is Wonderful; who, in his divine nature, is
"one with the Father over all, God blessed for ever;" and in his human
nature, "the man, whose name is the Branch;" and by the union of both
natures, the one glorious and true Messiah, "the Lord our
righteousness?" And hath such a conviction of the infinite importance of
knowing Christ been wrought thereby upon thy mind, that thou hast taken
every method of recommending him to others? Surely, my soul, no truly
regenerated sinner, who hath known, and seen, and felt that the Lord is
gracious, but must be anxious that others should know, and see, and feel
it also. And, therefore, like this poor woman, thou wilt be taking every
proper opportunity of calling upon all, as far as thy sphere of
usefulness can extend, to come and enjoy the same blessings, which the
Lord hath imparted to thee. Precious Lord! I would not only invite every
poor needy sinner to come to thee, but I would desire to accompany them.
I would not say," Go to Jesus," as if I needed thee no more myself; but
I would say, "Come to him," let us go together, for "he will shew us of
his ways, and we will walk in his paths." And Oh! that multitudes may
come, and find to their soul's joy, as the Samaritans did, on the
invitation of this poor woman, and be enabled to say, as they said, "Now
we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves,
and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the
world."</span></p>

22—Morning—Numbers 13:23</h3>
<p>"And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
branch with a cluster of grapes."—Numb. xiii. 23.</p>
<p>Was not this single cluster of God's earnest to the people of the
sure possession of the land where those delicious fruits grew? And was
not the size and weight of this one branch a sample how full and
extensive all the blessings, both of the covenant and of the promised
land, should be to the after possession of God's people? My soul, dost
thou not see in it then a precious representation of Jesus, that one
branch, and of all that cluster of blessings which are in him? Well
might the church cry out concerning the Redeemer, "My beloved is unto me
as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi." For whether this
camphire, this copher, denotes the vine of Cyprus, or the fruit of the
palm-tree, in either, or in both, the soul-strengthening,
soul-exhilarating, soul-healing virtues of this unnumbered excellencies,
may well be set forth under the beautiful similitude, of the cluster of
grapes from the brook of Eshcol. Yes, thou dear Lord! thou hast
condescended to compare thyself to the vine; and to thy people thou art
indeed a cluster of all that is lovely, sweet, gracious, and endearing.
In thee dwelleth, like the berries of the richest cluster, all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily. In thee is found all the purity,
holiness, harmlessness, and perfection of the human nature, as God
manifest in the flesh. In thee, as God-man Mediator, we behold the
cluster of all spiritual graces, all spiritual, temporal, eternal
blessings, all divine promises, all, all are in thee, to give out to thy
people. Neither is there a mercy thy people can want, of grace here, or
glory hereafter, but what is treasured up in thee, in a fulness
perfectly inexhaustible. Precious Jesus, revive my spirits this day with
this view of thee. Give me to see when my soul desireth the first ripe
fruit, that thou thyself art all my soul can need. Bring me to the brook
of Eshcol, and there let my eyes, my heart, my whole soul, and body, and
spirit, feast itself in the contemplation and enjoyment of thy person,
thy graces, gifts, and fulness, until, under the full satisfaction my
soul findeth, in being eternally filled with thy goodness, I cry out
with the church, my beloved is unto me as the richest of all the
clusters of copher in the vineyards of Engedi.</p>

Kings 6:32</h3>
<p>"Look when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at
the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"—2 Kings vi.
32.</p>
<p>It is blessed to watch every dispensation of the Lord's providence,
as well as his grace; for Jesus is in all. So that when messengers of
heaviness come, and with sad tidings, as in this instance of the
prophet, if we shut to the door as they enter, and suffer them to open
their commission, we shall hear the sound of their master's feet behind
them, confirming every one. There are no events which can happen to a
child of God, but they ought to be thus dealt with. They are like
letters personally directed, and speak, in their whole contents, the
causes for which the king's post hath brought them; and they cannot be
mistaken, if they are well read, and pondered over; for they point to
the individual, as the prophet's servant to Jehu. "To which of all us,
(said Jehu) is this errand?" The answer was," To thee, O captain!" 2
Kings ix. 5. Now, my soul, learn hence how to receive all the messengers
of thy Lord. Shut the door upon them, and detain them, until thou hast
well studied, and perfectly understood their commission. Oh! my Lord
Jesus ] in all thine afflicting providences, cause me to hear my
master's feet following every one. "I know, Lord, that thy judgments are
right, and that thou in very faithfulness causeth me to be troubled." I
know, Lord, also, that they are graciously commissioned, and the issue
must be blessed. And I know, Lord, that even during their exercise,
however sharp, they will be sweetly sanctified, if, through thy blessing
upon them, they cause my poor heart to cleave the closer to thee. So
long then, dear Lord, as thou causest me to entertain right conceptions
of these soul exercises, let me never shrink from shutting the door,
that I may the more earnestly meditate upon thy messages; and if I see
Christ in every one, and blessings in every one, sure I am, the issue of
no one will ever be doubtful. I shah then learn the same precious lesson
that Job did, and through thy grace, like him, make it practical: and
bless a taking God, as well as a giving God: for, let the Lord take what
else he may from me, never, never will he take Christ from me; and while
I have him, in him I shah possess all things. Oh! for grace so to
receive all the sable messengers of my Lord, as to hear my master's feet
behind them. Sure I am, that when their black covering is removed, I
shall behold a fulness of blessings which they have brought with them
under their garments. Like the angel to Peter in the prison, they may
smite roughly on the side; but the very stroke will cause the chains to
fall from my hands, and open the prison doors, to give liberty and joy.

23—Morning—Isaiah 25:7</h3>
<p>"And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the, covering cast
over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations."—Isa.
xxv. 7.</p>
<p>What a precious promise was this with which the Lord comforted the
church under the old testament dispensation, that the faithful might
look forward to the new testament dispensation, when Jesus, in the holy
mountain, where he finished transgression by his triumphant death, would
effectually remove the covering which had blackened all faces, and had
separated between God and guilty sinners. And, that the gracious promise
might be had in everlasting remembrance by thy people, the evangelists
were commissioned to tell the church, that in the moment Christ died,
the vail of the temple was rent in twain, by an invisible hand, from the
top to the bottom. My soul, see how Jesus, thy Jesus, hath most
effectually fulfilled this precious promise. There was a vail of
covering spread to separate thee for ever from God, had not Jesus taken
it away, even the covenant of perfect obedience. God's injured
perfections formed also a total separation. And as if these were not
sufficient, the vail of sin would have for ever kept up this distance:
"Your iniquities have separated between God and you," saith the prophet.
But now by this precious undertaking in fulfilling the whole covenant of
works, restoring the honour to God the Father's injured perfections, and
opening a new and living way by his blood, which he hath consecrated
through the vail of his flesh, he hath opened the kingdom of heaven to
all believers. Precious Jesus, how endeared to my heart is this view of
thee and of thy great salvation! Yes, thou Lamb of God! I have seen by
thy Spirit's teaching, this deadly face of covering, which by sin hath
been cast over all people; and I have seen, by the same almighty grace,
that vail removed by thee. Now, Lord, in thee, and through thee, and by
thee, I am led to behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
And having fled for refuge to the hope that is set before me, this hope
I have in thee, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and
have cast it within the vail, whither thou, our forerunner, hast for us
entered, even our glorious High Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedec.</p>

<p>"All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh
to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to
do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the
Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I
should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And
this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the
Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise
him up at the last day."—John vi. 37—40.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul, commit this blessed portion to thy memory;
yea, beg of God the Holy Ghost to commit, and write all the gracious
things contained in it, on the inner tablets of thine heart! It is in
itself a gospel, yea, a fur gospel. Methinks, I would have it proclaimed
on the house-tops, and published, day by day, in every place of public
concourse throughout the earth, until the saving truths were every one
of them known, and felt, and enjoyed, by every poor awakened and needy
sinner. Mark, my soul, the several contents of what thy God and Saviour
hath here said: take the whole with thee to thy bed, this night, and
drop asleep, in faith of the whole, in the arms of Jesus; and if the
Lord bring thee to the light of the succeeding morning, let those sweet
and gracious words, which proceeded out of Jesus's mouth, salute thee
with the first dawn of the morning, arise with thee, and go about with
thee, in thy remembrance, until the whole be fulfilled in the kingdom of
heaven. Now mark their immense blessings, according to the order in
which they stand: "All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me."
</span><span class="c6">All;</span><span class="c5"> not one, or two, or
ten, or a million only, but </span><span class="c6">all.</span><span
class="c5"> And observe wherefore? They are the Father's gift to Jesus,
and therefore they must come. He saith elsewhere, "that I should give
eternal life to as many as thou hast given me," John xvii. 2. Hence,
therefore, there is a blessed provision, a blessed security, that they
shall come; for they are the Father's gift to Christ, as well as the
purchase of Christ's blood; and the promise is absolute in the charter
of grace;" Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power," Ps. cx.
3. And, to give every possible encouragement to the poor coming sinner,
whom God the Holy Ghost is leading by the hand to all-precious Jesus,
however unconscious that poor soul is of the gracious influence under
which he is coming, Jesus adds, "And him that cometh to me, I will in no
wise cast out." Observe the tenderness of our Lord's words. He had said,
</span><span class="c6">all</span><span class="c5"> shall come: but
Jesus well knew the most humble are the most timid, and the most apt to
be discouraged; and therefore he makes each one's case to be expressed
by the word </span><span class="c6">him:</span><span class="c5"> "him
that cometh." As if Jesus had said, ‘Let that poor creature, who is most
afraid, by reason of a conscious sense of his transgressions, take
comfort: if he cometh, let him know, that" I will in no wise cast him
out."’ And to confirm it still more, Jesus adds, 'For this is the very
purpose for which I came down from heaven; not only because it was my
full purpose to seek and save that which was lost, but it is the will of
my Father also, who sent me.' And, as if to impress this grand truth
upon every poor sinner's heart, he repeats the gracious words: "And this
is the will of him that sent me." He saith it twice, that there might be
no mistake. And yet farther: if a poor sinner should say, ' But
</span><span class="c6">how </span><span class="c5">am I to come, and in
</span><span class="c6">what </span><span class="c5">am I to come; what
are the qualifications for coming?' "This," saith the all-gracious
Redeemer, "this is the will of my Father, the will of him that sent me,
that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on him, shall have
everlasting life." And what is it to see the Son, but so to behold him
by the eye of faith, as to believe in him to the salvation of the soul;
to see him as the Christ, the Sent, the Sealed, the Anointed of God; the
one, and only one ordinance of heaven, for the redemption of poor
sinners; whose blood cleanseth from all sin, and whose righteousness
freely and fully justifieth every believing sinner? Pause, my soul, and
well ponder these precious, saving truths; and then take comfort in the
blessed assurance, that thou hast all these testimonies in thine own
experience, from having long since come to Christ, and long found the
certainty of these promises. Lie down, my soul, this night, yea, lie
down, my body, this, and every night, until the last night, even the
night of death shall come; for thou sleepest in Jesus by faith, and his
words are thy security: "Of all my Father hath given me, I should lose
nothing; I will raise him up at the last day."</span></p>

<p>"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a
golden-censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which was
before the throne."—Rev. viii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, behold this mighty Angel, even thy Jesus, in his priestly
office. Look at him with an earnest eye of faith before thou goest this
morning to the mercy-seat. See his golden censer, with his much incense,
and contemplate both the fulness of merit in his own glorious Person,
and the fulness of efficacy in his work and righteousness for the sure
acceptance of all his redeemed. Go near, my soul, having boldness to
enter now into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Hear thy great High
Priest bidding thee to take shelter under his golden censer, and behold
him presenting thy person and thy poor offerings upon the golden altar,
even his divine nature, before the throne. Yes, Lord! I would draw nigh
in thee, and by thee, convinced that it is wholly from thee, and for thy
sake, either my person or my prayers can find acceptance. For thee, and
for thy sake, my sins are pardoned, my offerings are accepted, grace is
bestowed, communion and fellowship is obtained; peace in this life, and
glory in that which is to come, are the portion of thy people. Hail,
thou glorious, gracious, all-sufficient, High Priest! To thee be glory
in the church, throughout all ages. Amen.</p>

24—Evening—Revelation 4:8</h3>
<p>"And they rear not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."—Rev. iv. 8.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Make a solemn pause, my soul, over these words; and
when thou hast found a fixedness of thought, that every faculty may be
engaged in the contemplation, ponder well this divine perfection of
Jehovah, the holiness of his nature, by which an eternal distinction is
drawn between him and all his creatures. None but Jehovah can be
essentially holy. Angels, who have never sinned, have indeed a holiness;
but it is derived from Him, it exists not in themselves, and, in point
of comparison, is but as the shadow to the substance; moreover, being in
their nature mutable creatures, their holiness may be changed also: the
fallen angels are proofs in point. But with Jehovah, holiness is in
himself; the peculiar glory of his nature, and inseparable from his very
existence. Pause over this view, for it is scriptural, and truly
blessed. Go on to another observation. Thrice is the ascription of
holiness given, in this sublime song of the blessed in heaven, as if to
point out the personality of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the Holy
undivided Three," which bear record in heaven, for these three are one,"
I John v. 7. When these glorious truths are suitably impressed upon
thee, pause once more, and consider with what distinguishing characters
the holiness of Jehovah is set forth in the word of God. The heavenly
host are said to rest not day and night in proclaiming their deep sense
and adoration of Jehovah in this glorious attribute. Now here is
somewhat for the mind to lean upon, in contemplating Jehovah's holiness.
Jehovah is </span><span class="c6">eternal </span><span class="c5">also,
and hath commanded the church to know him as the </span><span
class="c6">faithful </span><span class="c5">God, Deut. vii. 9. But we
never read that the host of worshippers thrice repeat his eternity, or
his faithfulness, in their hymns, of adoration and praise. Moreover,
Jehovah himself seems to have pointed out this divine attribute as among
the distinguishing excellencies he will be known by; for he singles it
out to swear by:" I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not lie
unto David," Ps. lxxxix. 35. Precious thought for the poor timid
believer to keep always in view! For it is as if Jehovah had said, 'I
have pledged my holiness, as an attribute essential to my very nature,
that what I have promised to David's Lord, even my dear Son, of the
redemption of his seed, as sure as I am holy, I will most certainly
perform.' Moreover, my soul, holiness is the glory .of Jehovah. Hence
the song of the church:" Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods!
who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness!" Exod. xv. 11. And hence
Jehovah is said to be worshipped "in the beauties of holiness;" Ps. cx.
3. My soul! keep this also in remembrance. If the representation of an
angel, or a man, were to be made, we should figure to ourselves the most
beautiful countenance; and if Jehovah be represented to us, how is it
done? Surely in the beauty of holiness; for God the Holy Ghost gives us
"the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus
Christ!" 2 Cor. iv. 6. Pause over these infinitely solemn meditations,
and while thou art overawed (as, indeed, it is impossible but to be so)
in the contemplation of distinguishing a perfection of the divine
nature; and, moreover, as this view of God's holiness is so directly
opposed to the unholiness of a poor fallen sinful creature, as thou art,
look up for grace from the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and take relief in
the sweet and consoling consideration, that to this glorious God thou
art permitted, yea, commanded and encouraged, to draw near, in and
through the holiness of thy Redeemer. Hail, blessed Jesus! upheld by the
right arm of thy righteousness, and washed from all our sins in thy
blood, all thy church may here draw nigh by faith, and send forth their
feeble breathings in the same strain as the church in thy presence doth
above, while in their hymns day and night, they shout aloud, "Holy!
holy! holy! Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to
come!"</span></p>

25—Morning—Psalm 34:15</h3>
<p>"The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
unto their cry."—Ps. xxxiv. 15.</p>
<p>My soul, never more allow thyself to suppose that thou art overlooked
or forgotten amidst the immensity of God's works. Is it not the province
of a father to attend to the wants of his children? And will not God
regard his own, that cry night and day unto him, though he bear long
with them? This was the very argument of our Redeemer. Do you, saith
Jesus, "that are evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children;
and shall not your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask
him?" But, my soul, while thou art taking comfort from this view of
divine love, take with thee another sweet thought from this precious
verse of scripture. Whose eyes are thus upon thee, and whose ears are
thus open to thy cries, but those of the Lord Jesus? Oh how sweet the
thought, that by reason of the Son of God, as Christ, being in our
nature, and he having taken upon him our nature, he hath eyes to see,
and ears to hear,, such as we have. What a blessed light the Holy Ghost
hath thrown over all those precious passages in which God is spoken of
as having eyes, and ears, and an arm, and the like, describing himself
by human powers; that it is indeed the divine nature of the Man Christ
Jesus. It is Jesus, the Mediator, the Redeemer, the exalted and
triumphant Saviour, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; who
"having loved his own which are in the world, hath loved them unto the
end." My soul, learn then to behold in all these sweet portions, that it
is Jesus, thy Husband and Brother, as well as thy God and Saviour, and
both forming one glorious Christ, whose eyes are always upon thee, and
whose ears are always attentive to thy cries, and to the cries of all
his redeemed.</p>

25—Evening—Isaiah 6:5</h3>
<p>"Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of
unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of clean lips."—Isa.
vi. 5.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> My soul! thy last evening was deeply exercised on
that glorious subject, the holiness of Jehovah. Let this evening's
meditation call thee to what ought immediately to follow; thy unholiness
and corruption. What a transition! And yet what more suited for
meditation? The prophet Isaiah, who had been admitted to the view of a
vision, like that which John the apostle saw in the after ages, beheld
the glory of Christ, and heard those who cried, "Holy,holy, holy, is the
Lord of Hosts! and the effect was as is here related. His consternation
was so great, concluding that he should be struck dead (agreeably to
what holy men of old had conceived, that the sight of God would produce
death), that he cried out, "Woe is me, I am undone." Pause, my soul!
thou art also "a man of unclean lips!" How dost thou hope to see the
face of God in glory? How art thou prepared for such an overwhelming
sight? Convinced of thy uncleanness, and convinced also that God is of
purer eyes than to behold iniquity, neither can any evil dwell with him;
how art thou looking for acceptance here by grace, and the everlasting
acceptance and admittance of thy person hereafter in glory before God?
Ponder the subject well, and consider, under this particular, as in
every other, the blessedness of an union with Christ, and an interest in
Christ. Here lie all thy hopes, all thy confidence, all thy security!
Undone as thou art in thyself, and unclean as thy lips and thy whole
nature are, by reason of sin, both from the original state in which thou
wast conceived and born, and the actual transgressions which thou hast
committed; yet looking up to the throne, in and through Jesus, thy
Husband, thy Surety, thy Sponsor; here it is, my soul, and here alone,
that thy confidence is well founded, and all thy hopes secure. And dost
thou not feel a holy joy, a sweet undescribable delight, in
contemplating the divine holiness; while contemplating, at the same
time, thine own interest and right in the holiness of the Lord Jesus?
Art thou not full of rapture in beholding the glory of God's holiness,
for which, rather than an atom of it should be tarnished by the sinner,
the Son of God assumed the nature of his people, and died on the cross,
to make atonement? And art thou not comforted in the blessed view, that
God's holiness hath received more glory, more honour, by the obedience
and sacrifice of the Glory-man, Christ Jesus, than could have been given
by the everlasting obedience of men and angels to all eternity? And say,
moreover, dost thou not at times take delight in drawing nigh to the
throne of grace, and offering thy poor feeble praises of" Holy, holy,
holy, is the Lord God of Hosts," when thou art approaching, and holding
communion with God, in and through the holy Jesus, thy 'Redeemer? Oh!
thou dear Emmanuel, </span><span class="c6">in </span><span
class="c5">whom alone, and by whom alone, all my hopes and confidences
are founded, I fall down at thy feet, and as the prophet cried out, so
do I desire unceasingly to exclaim, "I am a man of unclean lips!" But do
thou cause the iniquity to be taken away, and my sin to be purged, by
the live coal, from thee, who art our new testament altar, and I shall
be clean; for thou art the Lord my righteousness.</span></p>

26—Morning—Proverbs 8:22, 23</h3>
<p>"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way: before his works
of old, I was set up from everlasting."—Prov. viii. 22, 23.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over those most blessed words, and see what glories
are contained in them. May God the Spirit glorify Christ to thy view
while pondering these words! Who is it that speaks them? Is it not
wisdom! Even Christ, the wisdom of God, as the apostle elsewhere calls
him? But how was he possessed by the Lord, and how set up from
everlasting? Not openly in the human form, that he was in the fulness of
time to take upon him for the purpose of redemption; but, as it should
seem, secretly, as subsisting in covenant engagements from everlasting.
Mediator, was it not? Not as yet made flesh, but if we may from another
scripture draw the conclusion, "as the image of the invisible God, the
first-born of every creature," Col. i. 15. What a glory, beheld in this
view, doth this precious scripture, with all that follows it in the
chapter, hold forth! The Son of God, in covenant engagements from
everlasting, was in time to take into himself manhood, and from the
union of both God and man become one Christ. Hence, from everlasting,
wisdom, one of those natures, is set up and speaks as a person, not
separate or distinct from the other nature of the Godhead, but as in
union, and from both, forming in covenant settlements the one glorious
Mediator. So that it is not wisdom, as a person, speaking, without
subsisting in the Son of God, neither is it the Son of God without
wisdom subsisting as such in him, but both forming one identical person,
and that person the Mediator, whose name was then secret, but afterwards
was to be called Wonderful, when by the open appearance of the Son of
God, tabernacling in a body of flesh, redemption work from everlasting,
covenanted for and agreed upon by the several persons of the Godhead,
was to be completed. What a blessed contemplation is here opened, my
soul, to thy diligent and humble inquiry. Here direct all thy
researches; here let prayer ascend for divine teachings to guide thee;
and here behold him, who in the after ages of his love, made an open
display of himself, as the God-man, when he manifested forth his glory,
and his disciples believed on him; thus. as the wisdom-man, declaring
himself as possessed by Jehovah in the beginning of his way, and set up
before all worlds as Jehovah's delight, while his delights were with the
sons of men. Oh the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom
which God ordained before the world began!</p>

class="c5">June 26—Evening—Exodus 28:30</span></h3>
<p>"The Urim and the Thummim."—Exod. xxviii. 30.</p>
<p>There is somewhat very interesting in this account of "the Urim and
the Thummim;" though in the present distance of time, we can at the best
form nothing more than conjectures as to what it was. But through grace,
and the teaching of the Holy Ghost, we can have clear views of what it
meant. The general acceptations of the Hebrew words, are, lights and
perfections. And as Aaron, as high priest, became a lively type of
Christ, so, by bearing on his breast-plate "the Urim and the Thummim,"
there can be no difficulty in beholding Jesus represented as the light
and perfection of his people. And as Aaron bare all the names of the
people upon his breast, where "the Urim and Thummim" were worn; how
delightful is it to see Jesus thus represented, as bearing all the
persons of his redeemed, in his own light and perfection, when he goes
in before the presence of God for us! Sweet and precious thought to the
believer! And now the church cries out: "Set me as a seal upon thine
heart, as a seal upon thine arm;" Song viii. 6. And so important did
this appear to Moses, when dying, that he expressly prayed, that" the
Thummim and the Urim might be with Jehovah's Holy One;" Deut. xxxiii. 8.
Now here we have at once the application of the whole; for who is
Jehovah's Holy One, but the Lord Jesus Christ? With him it eminently
remained, and with him only. For during the captivity, it was lost with
the temple, and was never again restored. But with Jesus, the
continuance of it was everlasting, for he hath "an unchangeable
priesthood, and is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever."
Precious Lord Jesus! be thou "the Urim and the Thummim" to my soul; for
thou art both the light and perfection of thy people, in grace here, and
glory for ever.</p>

<p>" I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last."—Rev. i. 11.</p>
<p>My soul, if the precious meditation of yesterday be not wholly gone
off from thy poor forgetful mind this day, here is another blessed view
to revive the thought afresh, in looking at the Mediator, as the Alpha
and Omega, the first and the last, in the same covenant engagements.
Jesus is indeed, as the 8th verse of this same chapter expresses it, the
Alpha and Omega, as one with the Father, over all, God blessed for ever.
But he is also here the Alpha and Omega, as the Mediator, both God and
man. For he is the first and the last of all God's thoughts, and in his
covenant engagements, of all Jehovah's work; for every thing in creation
begins and concludes in him. From everlasting he was set up. So that
though Adam was the first man openly, yet not the first man secretly,
and as subsisting in covenant engagements. Here again, as was remarked
before, and from an authority not to be disputed," he is the image of
the invisible God, the first-born of every creature, that in all things
he might have the preeminence." Precious Jesus, be thou to me the Alpha
and Omega. And as it is plain that Jehovah possessed thee as the
glorious covenant head of thy people in the beginning of his way, and
before his works of old, so cause me to possess thee as the all in all,
the first and the last, the author and finisher of my salvation.</p>

27—Evening—Philippians 3:12</h3>
<p>"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:
but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
apprehended of Christ Jesus."—Phil. iii. 12.</p>
<p>My soul! take the apostle for an example in thine evening's
meditation. Here he freely and fully confesseth himself, after all his
attainments in the life of grace, to be far short of what he longed to
attain. And observe the aim of the apostle: all his pursuit, and all his
desire was, like an arrow shot at a mark, to apprehend Christ, as Christ
had first apprehended him: to grasp Jesus, as the Lord Jesus had held,
and did hold him. Happy desire! happy pursuit! and blessed mark of
grace! For let the Lord have given out to the soul ever so largely,
there is more to give out, more to be received, more to be enjoyed. And
the Holy Ghost, who is leading a child of God out of himself, more and
more, to lead him more and more to the enjoyment of Jesus, is sweetly
training that precious soul, and advancing him to the highest lessons in
the school of grace. Paul felt this, when he cried out, "Not that I have
already attained, either were already perfect." To be sure not: for if
we thought we had enough of Christ, it would be more than half
conviction that we had nothing at all. Now, my soul, learn from Paul, in
what the life of God in the soul consists: to be always pursuing the
person of Jesus, for the farther enjoyment of him; never sitting down
satisfied with what is already attained; but" pressing (as the apostle
did) towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus:" in short, to make Christ the sum, the substance, the all
of every desire; and ever to keep in remembrance, that the more we
receive, the more Jesus hath to impart; the more he gives out, the more
he is glorified; and, like some rich spring, the oftener we receive from
him, the more rich and full he flows: Oh the blessedness of such a
state! What a heaven upon earth would it be, if closely followed! To be
always living upon Jesus, coming to Jesus, thirsting after Jesus; and
the more we receive out of him, and of him, to have the soul's desires
after him the more increased by all we enjoy. Precious Lord! grant me
this felicity, that, like Paul, I may say," Not as though I had already
attained :" but all my longings are, so to apprehend and hold fast
Christ Jesus, as Christ Jesus hath apprehended and doth hold me
fast.</p>

28—Morning—Genesis 43:11</h3>
<p>"Carry down the man a present."—Gen. xliii. 11.</p>
<p>Ah, poor Jacob, how unconscious wert thou that this man, the governor
of Egypt, was so near and dear to thee, and that his bowels yearned to
tell thee how much he loved thee. And O ye sons of Israel, who would
have had power to convince you while you were bowing down before Joseph
under the dreadful apprehensions which agitated your minds, and he was
assuming a voice of displeasure, that this very man was your brother? My
soul, and what was all this, heightened to the greatest possible degree
in the real love and affection of Joseph towards his family, compared to
that love of Jesus which passeth knowledge? Jesus is thy brother, and he
is the governor, not of Egypt only, but of heaven and earth. The famine,
it is true, is sore in the land, and to him thou must go for sustenance,
or thou wilt perish for ever. But wilt thou carry down the man a
present? My soul, what hast thou to carry? Not thy duties, nor thy
prayers, thine alms, thy righteousness; these are all filthy rags.
Besides, he to whom thou goest needeth not the gifts and offerings of
his creatures. His terms are, without money and without price. Go then,
my soul, poor and wretched as thou art, go to him with a broken and a
contrite heart, for that he will not despise. And O what a volume of
mercies, blessings, and graces is contained in that one word of his,
when he shall say, I am Jesus, your brother! Precious Jesus, I would
say, thou art indeed a brother born for adversity. "Thou art he whom thy
brethren shall praise, and all thy father's children shall bow down
before thee."</p>

<p>"And the Spirit and the bride say, come. And let him that heareth,
say, come. And let him that is athirst, come. And whosoever will, let
him take the water of life freely."—Rev. xxii. 17.</p>
<p>My soul, doth not the evening bell, which calleth to the ordinance,
in all its melodious sounds, seem to express these gracious invitations?
Wilt thou not attend? Private meditation is indeed sweet; but public
ordinances are of more avail. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob!" What a blessed sight is it to see the
house of God well filled! What a refreshment to my poor weary sin-sick
soul, to hear Jesus in his word saying, "Come unto me, all ye that are
weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." And every part and
portion of the service proclaims the gospel cry:—"Ho! every one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye,
buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk, without money, and without
price." Isa. lv. 1. And do observe, my soul, how, in the close of
scripture, the invitation is repeated; as if to leave the impression
fresh and lasting upon every soul. Yea, the Spirit confirms it; "come,"
is the call of the Holy Ghost; "come," is the call of the whole church,
the bride, the Lamb's wife; yea, every one that heard of the free, and
full, and glorious salvation; the angels, the ministering spirits to the
heirs of salvation, they join the pressing invitation, and cry, "come."
And surely every thirsty soul will not cease to say the same, for
whoever-the Lord the Spirit hath made "willing in the day of his power,"
may come in the day of his grace. And if Jesus, with his great
salvation, be welcome to his heart, that heart is welcome to come to
Jesus. My soul, with what a cloud of witnesses is the church of the
living God encompassed; and how many and numerous are the invitations of
grace! Wilt thou not then, in return, echo to the cry, and hasten thy
Redeemer's coming, in the same earnest language? Come, Lord Jesus! to
thy bride, the church, and be thou to all thy redeemed the water of
life, and the fountain of life; until thou take home thy church, which
is here below, to join thy church above, that they may unitedly dwell
together, in the light of thy countenance for evermore!</p>

fruitless search the parents made for Jesus in the days of his flesh?
What kinsfolks and acquaintances shall we now search among for the
Saviour? My soul, how little of Jesus is to be found in this Christless
generation! What parlour conversation makes mention of his name? Is it
not plain and evident, from the general, nay almost universal silence
observed in all companies concerning his name, and offices, and
characters, and relations, that Christ is not there? Shall we seek him
among the professors of the gospel? Who are they that honour Jesus? Not
they who deny his Godhead; not they who deny the influences of his Holy
Spirit; not they who set up their own righteousness as part, or the
whole of their justification before God. Jesus is not in that house, in
that family, in that heart, among that people who live in sensuality,
profaneness, and impiety. Where shall we seek Jesus? Blessed Lord, mine
eyes are unto thee to be taught. I would say unto thee, in the language
of the church, "Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest,
where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon. Oh when I shall find thee
without, I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
would instruct me; and I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the

Corinthians 5:8</h3>
<p>"Let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven
of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth."—I Cor. v. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou duly considered the unsuitableness of all leaven
to mix up with the unleavened bread of the gospel of Jesus? Whatever
sours, and gives a principle of taint to the mind, is indeed a leaven,
carefully to be avoided. And "a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump!"
So that it was expressly enjoined, in the divine precept of the law, on
the passover, that "there should be no leaven found in their houses; the
soul that did eat of it was to be cut off from the congregation." Exod.
xii. 19. Sweet instruction, couched under the prohibition! With Jesus
there is to be no mixture; nothing of creature leaven, of self-will, or
self-righteousness to mingle. My soul, thou hast been at the gospel
feast, and sat with Jesus at his table. Surely thou hast kept the feast
then, as here enjoined, and allowed nothing of leaven, in the old nature
or in the new, to be with thee. Oh! the blessedness of thus receiving
Christ with "the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth!" Oh! the
felicity of receiving a broken Christ into a broken heart; preciously
feeding upon his body broken, and his blood shed, as the sole, the only,
the all-sufficient means of salvation by faith! Oh! Lamb of God! keep
thy table sacred from all leaven, both in the persons approaching it,
and the offerings made upon it. Let not the children's bread be
received, or given to the leaven of hypocrisy and wickedness; but let
all who meet around thy board be of the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth! And do thou, Lord, come into thy house, to thy table, to thy
people; and let each for himself hear, and joyfully accept the
invitation of the kind Master: "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink

30—Morning—Hosea 14:3</h3>
<p>"In thee the fatherless findeth mercy."—Hosea xiv. 3.</p>
<p>Sweet thought! In Jesus, and the relationship, which he hath
condescended to place himself in, all his poor followers may find a
supply to till up every vacancy. My soul, contemplate Jesus in this
blessed feature of character. What relation do we need? The fatherless
are commanded to look to him whose name is the everlasting Father. The
motherless also; for he hath said, "As one whom his mother comforteth,
so will I comfort thee." Doth death make a breach between the husband
and the wife? Then the scripture saith, "Thy Maker is thine husband, the
Lord of Hosts is his name." Are we friendless? "Jesus is the friend that
loveth at all times, that sticketh closer than a brother." In short,
there is no situation among the affinities of life, the kinder charities
of nature, but what Jesus fills and infinitely transcends all. Pause, my
soul, over this view of Jesus, and behold how he graciously proposeth
himself to supply all wants, and to fill all vacancies. Jesus is both
the Father, the Friend, the Brother, the Husband, the whole in one of
all relationships and of all connexions. And amidst all the changes, the
fluctuating circumstances of human affairs, the frailties, and
infirmities of our own hearts and the hearts of others, which sometimes
separate chief friends, what a blessed thought it is; "Nothing can
separate from the love of Christ!" Precious Lord, give me to cry out
with the church, under the full assurance of thine unalterable love;
"This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of
Jerusalem."</p>

Thessalonians 4:16</h3>
<p>"With the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God."—I
Thess. iv. 16.</p>
<p><span class="c5"> Before I drop into the arms of sleep, I would call
upon my soul to ponder these words. I know not, each night, when
retiring to rest, whether my next awakening may not be "with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God." As what </span><span
class="c6">may be </span><span class="c5">my state in this particular,
and </span><span class="c6">hath been </span><span class="c5">the state
of many (for the hour of a man's death is to all intents and purposes
the day of judgment) becomes an infinitely momentous concern; how can I
better close the day and the month together, than by a few moments'
consideration of the solemn event? What is meant by "the voice of the
archangel?" I do not recollect the name of the archangel being mentioned
any where beside in scripture, except Jude 9. and here, as well as
there, the person spoken of is but one. We have no authority to say,
archangels; yea, it should seem, from what the apostle Jude hath said
concerning the archangel, in calling him Michael (if compared with the
vision of Daniel, chap. x. 21. and also with what is said in the book of
the Revelations, chap xii. 7.) that it means the person of Christ. Jesus
himself hath said, that "the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God; and all that are in their graves shall come forth." John v. 25-28.
At any rate, if the Holy Ghost speak but of one, and there be but the
shadow of a probability that that one is Christ, it becomes very faulty
to join others in the name, by making the word plural. With respect to
"the trump of God," we may understand, that as the law was given with
solemn splendour and glory on mount Sinai, so the consummation of all
things will testify the divine presence. My soul, meditate on these
things; give thyself wholly to the frequent consideration of them. And,
by the lively actings of faith upon the person of thy Lord, contemplate
thy personal interest in all the blessedness of this great day of God.
If this "voice of the archangel," be indeed the voice of Jesus, and thou
knowest now by grace thy oneness and union with him, shall not the very
thought give thee holy joy? It is true, indeed, the day will be solemn,
yea, profoundly solemn. But it is equally true, that it will be glorious
to all the redeemed. And if the Lord Jesus commanded his disciples to
look up, and lift up their heads with holy joy, when their redemption
drew nigh, shall we not suppose that it must be pleasing to the mind of
our God and Saviour that we welcome and hail the fulfillment of it? Yea,
must it not be pleasing to our God and Father, that we believe in his
Son Jesus Christ to this day of eternal salvation? We find the apostles
thus encouraging the faithful Paul tells Titus to be "looking for that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus ii. 13. Surely, if the hope be blessed, and
the appearing of Jesus, as the Redeemer of his people, glorious; our
souls should triumph in the expectation. Peter goes one step farther,
and bids the church not only to be looking but hasting unto the coming
of it; as souls well assured of their safety in Jesus; and therefore to
cry out with holy faith, "Come Lord Jesus, come quickly!" 2 Pet. iii.
12. What sayest thou, my soul, to these things? Are they blessed? Are
thy hopes thus going forth in desires after Christ's coming? Oh! the
blessedness of falling asleep each night, in the sleep of nature, in the
perfect assurance of a oneness with Christ? And Oh! the blessedness of
falling asleep in Jesus, when the Lord gives the signal for the sleep of
death! All the intervening lapse of time, from death to this hour of the
"voice of the archangel," is totally lost to the body, like the
unconscious lapse of time to the labouring man of health, whose sleep
each night is sweet. When the patriarchs, of their different ages, arise
at "the trump of God," their bodies will be equally unconscious whether
the sleep hath been for one night, or several thousand years. Think, my
soul, of these solemn but precious things. Frequently meditate with holy
joy and faith, upon this great day of God. Recollect that it is Jesus
who comes to take thee home. And having long redeemed thee by his blood,
he then will publicly acknowledge thee for his own, and present thee to
the Father and himself, as a part of his glorious church, "not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but to be for ever without blame
before him in love."</span></p>

1—Morning—Song of Solomon 1:3</h3>
<p>"Because of the savour of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment
poured forth."—Song i. 3.</p>
<p>Why, my Lord, is thy name so truly blessed, but because thou hast so
endeared it to thy redeemed, by every tie which can gain the affections.
Didst thou, even before I had being, enter into suretyship engagements
for me, that thou wouldest redeem me when fallen, that thou wouldest
take my nature, live for me, die for me, become a sacrifice for me, shed
thy blood for me, wash me in thy blood, clothe me with thy
righteousness, justify me before God and thy Father, become my Advocate,
High Priest, Intercessor, betroth me to thyself here in grace, and
everlastingly unite me to thyself in glory hereafter? Didst thou do all
this, and art thou still doing it, making my cause thine own, and
following me with love, and grace, and mercy, every day, and all day,
and wilt never thou leave me nor forsake me? And must not thy name be as
ointment poured forth? Can there be a savour as sweet, as fragrant, as
full of odour, as the name of Jesus? Precious ointments, it is true,
have a smell in them very grateful; but what savour can be like that
which to the spiritual senses manifests Jesus in his person, love,
grace, and mercy; in whom there is every thing desirable, and nothing
but what is lovely; all beauty, power, wisdom, strength, an assemblage
of graces more full of odour than all the spices of the east? Precious
Lord Jesus, let thy name be written in my heart, and let every thing but
Jesus be for ever obliterated there, that nothing may arise from thence,
but what speaks of thee; that through life and in death, the first and
the last, and all that drops from my lips, even in the separation of
soul and body, Jesus may form in the close of grace here, and in the
first opening of glory to follow, the one only blessed precious name, as
ointment poured forth.</p>

1—Evening—Daniel 7:13,14</h3>
<p>"I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man,
came with the clouds of heaen, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they
brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and
glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and langueages, should
serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."—Dan. vii. 13,
14.</p>
<p>Bless the Lord, my soul, who giveth thee "songs in the night", from
the night visions of the prophet. Read this sweet scripture, explained
as it is, most fully and completely, by the evangelists, in their
account of Jesus, as" the Son of man;" and what a wonderful coincidence
and agreement is there between them! It is in the human nature of the
Lord Christ, that the glories of this kingdom shine so full and
resplendant. "The Ancient of Days can he no other than God the Father,
who is truly the Ancient of Days, being self-existent, and from
everlasting to everlasting. And the Son of God, as God, one with the
Father, is the same from all eternity. But here he is spoken of as the
Christ of God, and particularly revealed to Daniel, in the visions of
the night, as" the Son of man." Ponder this well, my soul. Contemplate
the dominion, glory, and kingdom given to Jesus, in thy nature.
Recollect also, in the moment of thy meditation, that it is by virtue of
this nature, united to the Godhead, that the exercise of all
sovereignty, wisdom, and power, is carried on, and Christ's kingdom
established for ever. It saith, in this scripture, that these things
were given to him. They could not have been given to him as God; for all
things were his before: but as Christ, the Son of man; the Son of God
having taken into union with the Godhead our nature, became one Christ,
and as such, received them. And what endears the subject, in the
greatness and everlasting nature of it is, that Jesus is all this in our
nature. For here it is that that sweet scripture unfolds all its
beauty:" As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son
to have life in himself; because he is the Son of man!" John v. 26, 27.
Mark the peculiar blessedness of the expression, for the meditation is
most sweet. Jesus, as Jesus Mediator, hath life in himself. He doth not
hold it as at pleasure, or like creatures, which, because once given,
may be taken away. It is in himself in the human nature, because that
human nature is taken in, united to, and become one with the Godhead,
and therefore not liable to be recalled. Pause over this subject, this
glorious, blessed, joyful subject! Thy Jesus, my soul, hath life in
himself, in his human nature, because he is the Son of man. Think, then,
of thine everlasting safety in him; and thine unceasing glory from him:
for he saith himself, "Because I live, ye shall live also." Hallelujah.
Amen, Amen.</p>

2—Morning—Hosea 3:3</h3>
<p>"And thou shalt not be for another man; so will I also be for
thee."—Hosea iii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, was not God the Holy Ghost representing, by the similitude
of his servant the prophet's marriage with an adulteress, the
astonishing marriage of Jesus with our nature, and his personal-union
with every individual of his church and people? Look at this scripture,
and see how sweetly it points to Jesus. The prophet was commanded to
love this woman beloved of her friend, and yet an adulteress. He was to
buy her also to himself: and he was to charge her to abide with him, and
not to play the harlot any more, saying unto her: "And thou shalt not be
for another man, so will I also be for thee." Precious Jesus, do I not
behold thee in all this? Can any thing more strikingly shadow forth thy
grace, thy mercy, thy love, to thy people? Was not our whole nature
estranged from thee, when thou camest down from heaven to seek and save
that which was lost? Were not all in a state of daring adultery, when
thou hadst from everlasting betrothed thyself to us, in standing up our
glorious Husband and Surety? And how striking the expression: "Then said
the Lord unto me, go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend!" Surely at
the command of God thy Father, and not uncalled, unsent, unauthorized,
didst thou come. Our nature was indeed yet beloved of thee, our best and
dearest friend, though in a state of spiritual adultery, and wholly gone
away from thee. Yes, blessed Jesus! in defiance of all our multiplied
transgressions, it might be truly said, we were yet beloved adversity:
for thou went then, as now, unchangeable in thy love, the same Jesus
yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And surely, Lord, in another feature
the prophet shadowed thee forth; for as he purchased the harlot, so
thou, Lord, before we became thine, didst purchase us by thy blood. And
dost thou now say to me this day: "Abide with me, and thou shalt not be
for another man, so will I also be for thee?" Oh condescending God! Oh
precious, lovely, all loving Saviour! Lord, make me thine; yea,
altogether thine! Let my whole soul, and body, and spirit be all thine,
both by the conquests of thy grace, as they are justly thine, and by the
purchase of thy blood, that never, never more, I may depart from thee,
but with the same full consent as the church of old, I may exult in this
blessed assurance, "My beloved is mine, and I am his."</p>

2—Evening—Hebrews 5:14</h3>
<p>"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those
who, by reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good
and evil."—Heb. v. 14.</p>
<p>My soul! of what age art thou in the divine life? It is high time to
inquire: high time to know. And the information is not far to attain, if
thou dost wish it. A state of full age not only can receive, and relish
the strong meat of the gospel, but really desires it, longs for it, and
can be satisfied with nothing else. And what is the strong meat of the
gospel? Surely the person, the work, the glory, the grace, the love, the
every thing that is in Jesus, which belongs to Jesus, and flows from
Jesus. And depend upon it, that if thy spiritual senses are so
frequently exercised upon Jesus, as to relish this food, to delight in
it, yea, to loath all else, there will be a sweet savour of Jesus in thy
whole life and conversation. And in the exact proportion that thou
takest a fulness of this spiritual food, so may thine age be estimated.
All we hear, all we see, all we read of, or meet with, of Jesus, will be
food to the soul. Jesus is as the sweet flower of the field: and faith,
like the bee, gathers from it, and brings home, both the golden honey
and the wax to the hive, and lives upon it: so that then Christ is in
the heart, dwells in the heart, as the apostle terms it, by faith, and
is "formed in the heart the hope of glory." Now, where there is no
fulness of age, yea, no age at all, not a babe in Christ, nor even born
again, the strong meat of the gospel can neither be received, taken in,
nor enjoyed. An unawakened heart is not only incapable of strong meat,
but is disgusted at it. Persons of this kind may hear of Jesus, and
apparently, for the time seem pleased. For as all men, when they die,
would desire to go to heaven, so a discourse about it, may amuse, as a
subject at a distance. But there is nothing within them, with which the
subject can incorporate: no digestive powers to receive such strong
meat; and consequently no relish. A shower of rain in a dry season may
wet the surface, but if it soak not to the root, the plants find no
good. My soul! what saith thine experience to these things? Hath the
Lord so manifested himself to thee in all his glory, that nothing short
of Jesus can satisfy thee? Hast thou found a transforming power
accompanying this view of Jesus, so that, by faith, his glory hath
excited thy desires to partake of him? And do the daily hopes which
arise from such thoughts and views of thy Lord, so give rest, comfort,
and joy to thee, that these refreshments are like "the spiced wine of
the pomegranate?" Blessed Redeemer! may I be able to ascertain the real
ripeness of my age by testimonies like these; and sure I am, in this
view and enjoyment of Jesus, I shall find cause to give thanks, yea,
unceasing thanks, to "God and the Father, who thus maketh us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance with the saints in light."</p>

Timothy 1:5</h3>
<p>"Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and
of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."—I Tim. i. 5.</p>
<p>See, my soul, what Jesus hath secured for thee by his gracious
undertaking and accomplishment, and which his servant was commissioned
to tell the church, was the very end of the commandment; namely,
charity, or love. And this law of love is given thee, that thou mightest
manifest whose thou art, and to whom thou dost belong; not as a rule of
acceptance, for then that would be to make thy love a covenant of works;
but as a sweet testimony of thy affection in the hand of Jesus. It is a
law of love indeed, because the cords of love, by which thou art drawn,
prove it to be so. Thy obedience is not from slavish fear, for then this
would be bondage; but the love of Christ constrains thee. Thy love to
him makes thee long to be like him. Thy love to him makes his
commandments not grievous but gracious. Thy love to him makes ordinances
precious, because Jesus is the whole of them. And thy love to him makes
all that belongs to him dear, and in which Jesus requires thy proofs of
affection; not in thy strength, as the poor Israelites were demanded to
make brick without straw, but by living in thee, and working in thee,
both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Here, my soul, thou truly
findest strength and grace equal to thy day. The end of every
commandment, as well as the beginning, is love; for it begins in Jesus,
is carried on in Jesus, and ends in Jesus, and he is all love. And in
him, and by him, the conscience, the heart, faith, all are kept pure,
undefiled, and unfeigned, because love in Jesus is at the bottom; like
the chariot of Solomon, paved with love. Oh thou glorious pattern of all
holiness, make me like thyself!</p>

3—Evening—Joshua 4:23</h3>
<p>"The waters of Jordan."—Josh. iv. 23.</p>
<p>The sacred streams of Jordan, so often and so highly celebrated in
the word of God, open a very blessed subject for meditation. Sit down,
my soul, by the side of that ancient river, and call to mind the faith
exercised on that memorable spot by the multitude of the faithful gone
before, who were heirs with thyself of the promises; and see, whether
the Holy Ghost will not graciously, this evening, make thy meditation
sweet? Recollect, as thou viewest the hallowed ground, that here it was,
in this river, Jesus received the first public testimony from God the
Father; and the first open display of the descent of God the Holy Ghost.
Here Jehovah began to magnify the Lord Christ. And here, in ages before,
had the Lord begun to magnify that memorable type of Jesus, his servant
Joshua. And as, from the baptism of Jesus at this sacred river, the Lamb
of God opened his divine commission, so here Joshua, his type, commenced
his ministry. From hence he led the people to the promised land. And
from hence Jesus, in the baptism of his Holy Spirit, leads his redeemed
to the possession of the everlasting Canaan, in heaven. There is,
indeed, a double view of our Lord's ministry, in these waters of Jordan;
not only of baptism, as introductory to the wilderness-state of
temptation that follows to all his people; but also, as the close of the
wilderness-dispensation, in the Jordan of death, when, finally and
fully, Jesus leads them through, to their immortal possessions. And as
the children of Israel had been exercised for forty years together,
through a waste and howling wilderness, until they came to Jordan, which
opened a passage to them of life and liberty, to a land flowing with
milk and honey; so the followers of the Lord Jesus, having passed
through the pilgrimage of this world, amidst the various assaults of sin
and Satan, pass through the Jordan of death, conducted and secured by
their almighty leader, unto the possession of that kingdom of glory and
happiness which is above. Pause, my soul, over the review! behold, by
faith, the wonderful events which passed here. In this sacred river,
once rested the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth. Here
Jesus, whom the ark represented, was baptised. Here Israel passed over.
And here, my soul, must thou pass over in the hour of death. Oh! how
sweet and blessed, in the swellings of Jordan, to behold Jesus, and hear
his well-known voice, "Fear not; for I have redeemed thee; I have called
thee by thy name: thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I
will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee!"</p>

4—Morning—Luke 22:27</h3>
<p>"I am among you as he that serveth."—Luke xxii. 27.</p>
<p>Surely there is a blessedness in these words that affords substance
to feed upon. My soul, read them again and again; pause over them, pray
over them, and look up to him that thus so humbly, graciously, and
lovingly, expressed himself. Art thou, blessed Jesus, among thy people
as he that serveth? I know, Lord, that thou didst condescend to become
the servant of Jehovah, though thou weft Lord of all, when for the
salvation of poor sinners thou didst undertake to veil thy Godhead, and
in our nature to become our surety. And I know, Lord, also, that thou
didst, in a very memorable moment, and at a time when as the evangelist
had it to relate to the church, thou knewest that the Father had given
all things into thine hands, thou didst condescend to wash thy disciples
feet. But art thou still among thy people as one that serveth? Be
astonished, O heavens, and wonder, O earth! All power is thine in heaven
and in earth. And is Jesus among his people, among his redeemed ones,
his exercised ones, as he that serveth? Pause again, my soul—meditate
upon the blessed gracious words. Was there not a circumstance of trial,
when Christ was upon earth, but what he felt in his human nature, when
fulfilling all righteousness? Then will it follow, that there cannot be
a circumstance of trial which his members now feel, but what he knows;
nay, what he appoints. And if he appoints it, is he not looking on; nay,
measuring out suited strength, suited grace, as the circumstances shall
require? And if all this be in Jesus, now and every minute event both
his ordering, supporting under, carrying through, crowning in all, is he
not, though Lord of all, servant of all; and doth he not now say to
every poor disciple in the present moment, as fully as he did to them in
the garden with him, "I am among you as he that serveth?" My Lord and my
God, would I cry out, under the same conscious shame of my dreadful
unbelief, as Thomas did under his Yes, Lord, thou art still ministering,
still serving! And though I lose sight of thee in a thousand and ten
thousand instances, where nothing but thy imparted strength could carry
me through; yet plain and most evident it is, that in all the blessings
of thy finished redemption, thou thyself art giving out, and serving up,
grace to thy people. Thou didst first purchase all blessings with thy
blood; and now thou ever livest to see them administered by thy Spirit.
Precious Jesus, thou art ever with me. By and by I shall be with thee, I
shall see thee as thou art, and shall be satisfied when I awake with thy
likeness.</p>

4—Evening—Matthew 22:11</h3>
<p>"A wedding garment."—Matt. xxii. 11.</p>
<p>My soul! let this evening's meditations be directed to the subject
proposed in these few words: "a wedding garment." Very many are the
instructions which the passage contains. The Lord Jesus is representing,
under the similitude of a wedding feast, the rich provision God the
Father had made in the gospel, on account of the marriage of his dear
Son with our nature. And most beautiful, indeed, is the representation.
For what feast, in point of fulness, richness, and satisfaction, can
come up to that which is furnished for the poor, needy, and perishing
circumstances of famished and dying sinners? This feast of fat things
(as the scripture calls it) is indeed a rich feast, a royal feast, and a
true wedding feast: for as Jesus, on whose account it is made, hath
united our nature in general to himself, so hath he united each
individual of that nature in particular to himself, who is truly, and in
reality, made a partaker of it. But the parable supposes (which, though
not said, is implied) that the rich and bountiful Donor not only
provides a feast for the hungry, but a covering for the naked; and that
the very entrance to his table is inadmissible without this wedding
garment being accepted, put on, and worn by every individual who
partakes of the supper. The case is here stated of one unworthy creature
(and that one is a representative of all in like circumstances) who,
when the King came in to see the guests, was found deficient of this
covering. My soul! pause over this part. This man, it should seem, was
not observed by any around him. He had come in with the crowd, and
gained admittance with the rest. It was only when the King came in, that
he was discovered, and that by the King himself. What a volume of
instruction is contained in this short representation? So Jesus comes in
the midst of his churches. He presides at his table. Every individual is
seen, is known by him, with every secret motive for which each cometh.
It should seem, that at this supper there were great multitudes present,
and but one without a wedding garment. And yet that one could not be
hidden from the King's eye. My soul! while this furnisheth a subject for
awful consideration, so doth it no less for joyful thought. Hast thou
been at this gospel feast? Weft thou clothed in this wedding garment?
Surely, if so, thou art not at a loss to know. If the feast and the
garment were both of the King's providing, thou must know whether thou
camest to be clothed as well as fed; and whether the Lord, that provided
the food, gave thee also raiment? Say then, when Jesus invited thee to
his supper, didst thou go to it, as those in the highway, poor, and
maimed, and halt, and blind? And while he bade thee come, didst thou
regard his counsel; and buy of him, as he had said, without money, and
without price, "white raiment, that thou mightest be clothed, and that
the shame of thy nakedness should not appear?" Rev. iii. 18. Oh it is
blessed, very blessed, to go hungry to such a feast, and clothed in the
wedding garment of Jesu's righteousness, and have the robe put on by God
the Holy Ghost. Sure will be the acceptance, and gracious the reception,
to every poor, famishing, naked, sinner, that thus comes to the gospel
feast. Do remark, my soul, one circumstance more in this man's case. It
doth not appear that he was naked; for then it would have been said so;
and, if conscious of it, the bountiful Lord that made the feast would
have clothed him. He had a garment, but not a wedding garment. One of
his own providing; like those who have a righteousness of their own, of
whom the Lord elsewhere speaks: "Woe to the rebellious children, saith
the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a
covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin;" Isa. xxx.
1. Precious Lord Jesus! clothe me with the wedding garment of thy
righteousness; and feed me with the rich food of thy body and blood;
yea, Lord! be thou my covering, my joy, my all; that when at thy church,
at thy table, at thine house of prayer below, and at thine kingdom of
glory above, the King cometh in to see his guests, my soul may cry out,
in thine own blessed, words, and with a joy unspeakable and full of
glory: "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in
my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath
covered me with a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself
with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels;" Isa.
lxi. 10.</p>

5—Morning—Deuteronomy 22:11</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and
linen together."—Deut xxii. 11.</p>
<p>Though the true believer, who like the king's daughter is all
glorious within, cannot but know, that as meat commendeth us not to God,
so neither doth the necessary dress, which, since the fall, is become
suited to cover our sinful bodies, make a part of our holy faith; yet it
is highly proper, that persons professing godliness should use great
plainness of apparel. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, we are
told, is of great price in the sight of God. But who should have thought
that such a precept as this of Moses had a gospel signification! And yet
as Christ was preached under types and figure through the whole law, we
may reasonably suppose that not a single command was then given but what
had an eye to him and his great salvation. But if we find the Lord so
strict respecting the outward dress of the body, what may we conclude
the Lord would enjoin respecting the inward clothing of the soul? If
wollen and linen were offensive to be worn together, surely, we cannot
appear before God in the motley dress of Jesus's righteousness and our
own. The fine linen, scripture saith, is the righteousness of saints.
With this, which Jesus puts on his people, nothing of our own wollen
garments must be worn. The righteousness of a creature, had we any,
which in fact we have none, cannot be suited to mix with the
righteousness of the Creator. And no man that is wise for salvation,
would put the old piece of our corrupt and worn out nature upon the new
garment of the renewed nature in Christ Jesus. When therefore the Lord
saith, "thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts;" my heart
replies, no, Lord! let me be clothed with the robe of thy righteousness,
and the garment of thy salvation; then shall I be found suited for the
marriage supper, when the King comes in to see his guests at his
table.</p>

5—Evening—Hebrews 5:8</h3>
<p>"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience, by the things which
he suffered."—Heb. v. 8.</p>
<p>My soul! behold what a precious verse of scripture is here! How
blessedly doth it set forth thy Redeemer! See here what an example Jesus
shews to all his people, and how sweetly accommodating is that example
to every case and circumstance, into which any of them can be brought!
Surely, if any might have done without going into such a school of
suffering, for the purpose of learning, it must have been Jesus; but yet
even Jesus would not. And wouldest thou, my soul, after such an
illustrious pattern, desire to be excused? Hath not Jesus dignified it,
and made it blessed? Oh! the honour of following his steps. There is
another beauty in this scripture. The apostle, in a verse or two
preceding, took notice of Jesus in his human nature, that he sought not,
as such, the high priest's office uncalled. "Christ (saith he) glorified
not himself, to be made an high priest, but was called of God, as was
Aaron." And by reading this verse in connection with that, it is as if
the apostle had said, 'Yea, such was the wonderful condescension of the
Son of God, in his divine nature, that, though of the same nature and
essence with the Father, yet would he have his human nature trained up
in all the exercises of suffering; that, by a fellow feeling, his people
might know how he understood their exercises by his own.' Oh! thou
gracious, condescending Lord! Surely nothing can soften sorrow like the
consciousness that thou hast known it in our nature for thy people; and
nothing can more effectually reconcile all thine afflicted members,
humbly and patiently to learn obedience in the school of suffering, as
that Jesus, though a Son, and the Son of God, in the eternity of his
nature, was pleased, in his human nature, "to learn obedience by the
things which he suffered."</p>

6—Morning—Romans 8:37</h3>
<p>"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him
that loved us."—Rom. viii. 37.</p>
<p>"More than conquerors? mark that, my soul. Conquerors all the
soldiers of Jesus must be, for in his strength they fight, and he has
himself subdued all our foes, even death, the last enemy, and Satan,
whom the God of peace will bruise under our feet shortly. So that
victory is sure. For we overcome by the blood of the Lamb, by the sword
of the Spirit, and by the shield of faith, whereby we subdue all the
fiery darts of the wicked. But though conquerors, how are we more than
conquerors? Yes, through him that loved us, believers absolutely conquer
him that is himself unconquerable. For, by union with Jesus, we may be
said to have power with God, and to prevail. I will not let thee go,"
said the praying Jacob, "except thou bless me." A blessing he came for,
and a blessing he would have. So all the praying seed of Jacob have
power through the blood and righteousness of Jesus, in like manner.
Hence Jesus saith to his church: "Turn away thine eyes from me, for they
have overcome me." Sweet and precious thought, my soul, never lose sight
of it. Through him that loved thee, and gave himself for thee, thou art
more than conqueror: nay, thy present victories are more than the
victories of the church in heaven. For they have now no more conflicts
with tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword; but, by him that loved us, we arise above the midst
of them now, and while troubled on every side, we are not distressed;
while perplexed, are not in despair. The love of Jesus is seen in these
very exercises, and that in very love, and very faithfulness, the Lord
causeth us to be afflicted. Hence, through him we conquer them; nay, we
are more than conquerors. We love him that sends the affliction, because
we discover his love in it; and as without that affliction, the love of
our Jesus in sending it would in that instance not have been known,
therefore here we have a blessed victory the church above cannot know.
Precious Jesus! to thy love, however, and thy grace, be all the praise
and all the glory; for under thy banner of love alone it is that we are
more than conquerors.</p>

6—Evening—Leviticus 23:10</h3>
<p>"A sheaf of the first-fruits."—Levit. xxiii. 10.</p>
<p>This was a most interesting service in the Jewish church, and full of
gospel mercies; When the Lord appointed" a sheaf of the first-fruits" of
their harvest to be brought before him, and waved towards heaven, as a
token that all fruits were of the Lord, and that he was both the giver
and proprietor of all. And it hath reference to the person of Christ,
both in his death and resurrection. For "a lamb of the first year,
without blemish," was to be offered as a burnt-offering with it, to
testify that the death of Jesus sanctifies and sweetens all; and Christ
himself, in his resurrection, is the "first-fruits of them that sleep."
My soul! dost thou observe this Jewish service in a gospel dress?
Surely, the service is a reasonable service, and, if possible, more
heightened now than then. When this law was given, the Israelite had no
power to perform it; neither indeed was it intended to be observed,
until the people arrived in Canaan. There was neither tilling of land,
nor sowing of seed, in the wilderness; for the people were victualled by
the immediate bounty of heaven; and we are told, that they ate the manna
until that they came to Canaan. But when they were settled in the land
which the Lord had promised them, and God gave them "fruitful seasons,
filling their hearts with food and gladness," surely it was meet thus to
acknowledge God in his providences, as the providence of God had owned
and blessed them. What sayest thou to it, my soul? Here was Jesus in the
sheaf of the first-fruits. Here was the Father's blessing, acknowledged
in the gift of Jesus. Here was Jesus represented in the lamb, which
accompanied the service. Here was the waving it towards heaven, and a
prohibition not to eat bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until
God's portion had been first offered! Oh! my soul, wilt thou not learn
hence, to trace Jesus in every one of thy blessings, and to bless thy
God and Father for a sanctified use of every thing in Jesus! Help me,
Lord, I pray thee, in my heart, in my house, in the field, in the city,
in the church, in the closet, in the world, in the family, to be for
ever waving before my God, "the sheaf of the first-fruits" in all his
bounties. In Jesus I have all; in Jesus would I enjoy all; and then
shall I most assuredly have that sweet promise for ever fulfilling in my
heart: "Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of
all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy
presses shall burst out with new wine;" Prov. iii. 9, 10.</p>

<p>"Hope deferred, maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it
is a tree of life."—Prov. xiii. 12.</p>
<p>Surely, my Lord and Saviour is the sum and substance of this sweet
verse! For art thou not the hope of Israel, and the Saviour thereof? And
if thou deferrest giving to my soul renewed views of thy pardoning love,
or withholdest the renewed visits and manifestations of thy grace, will
not my soul languish and my whole heart be sick? Can I, dear Lord,
continue for a moment in health of soul without thee? And art thou not
my desire, when thou art the desire of all nations? And when thou comest
to my soul in all thy freeness, fulness, suitableness, and
all-sufficiency, art thou not the very tree of life in the paradise of
God? Precious, precious Jesus! give me to sit down under thy shadow with
great delight, for surely thy fruit is sweet to my taste. Do not defer
thy blessed visit to my soul this morning, for thou knowest, Lord, that
though, through thy grace, that sickness of sin which is unto death,
thou hast already cured by the application of thy blood and
righteousness; yet there is a sickness not unto death, and which my soul
will pine and languish under, unless thou renewest me from day to day.
Oh, blessed Jesus, I want every moment fresh manifestations, renewed
discoveries of thy presence, grace, and favour. I want to know thee
more, to love thee more, to live to thee more; and the deferring these
precious mercies maketh my heart sick. Come then, thou blessed Lord,
with all thy fulness; my desires are to thee, and to the remembrance of
thy name. With my soul have I desired thee in the night; and now, with
the first dawn of day, would I seek thee early. And surely, when thou
comest, as I know thou wilt come, thou wilt be in deed and in truth the
tree of life. Methinks my soul is now opened by thee for thy reception;
and therefore, Lord, do thou now make such rich discoveries of thy
person, glory, grace, and love, as may fill every portion of my heart;
nay, Lord, I pray to feel such goings forth of my poor soul, in waiting
for thy coming, that, like the queen of Sheba, overpowered in the view
of the riches and wisdom of Solomon, my views of thy condescending
grace, and a sense of my unworthiness to be so blessed of my God, may
melt my whole soul before thee; and, like her, there may be no more
spirit in me from such ravishing enjoyments of thy presence.</p>

7—Evening—John 11:35</h3>
<p><span class="c6">"Jesus wept."</span><span class="c5">—John xi.
35.</span></p>
<p>My soul! look at thy Redeemer in this account of him. Was there ever
a more interesting portrait than what the evangelist hath here drawn of
the Son of God? If the imagination were to be employed forever in
forming an interesting scene of the miseries of human nature, what could
furnish so complete a picture as these two words give of Christ, at the
sight of them? "Jesus wept." Here we have at once the evidence how much
the miseries of our nature affected the heart of Jesus; and here we have
the most convincing testimony, that he partook of all the sinless
infirmities of our nature, and was truly, and in all points, man, as
well as God. We are told by one of the ancient writers (as well as I
recollect, it was St. Chrysostom) that some weak but injudicious
christians in his days, were so rash as to strike this verse out of
their bibles, from an idea, that it was unsuitable and unbecoming in the
Son of God to weep. But we have cause to bless the over-ruling
providence of God, that though they struck it out from their bibles,
they did it not from ours. It is blessed to us to have it preserved, for
it affords one of the most delightful views we can possibly have of the
affectionate heart of Jesus, in feeling for the sorrows of his people.
And methinks, had they judged aright, they would have thought, that if
it were unsuitable or unbecoming in Jesus to weep, it would have been
more so to put on the appearance of it. And why those groans at the
grave of Lazarus, if tears were improper? Precious Lord! how refreshing
is it to my soul the consideration, that, "Forasmuch as the children
were partakers of flesh and blood, thou likewise didst take part of the
same; that in all things it behoved thee to be made like to thy
brethren!" Hence, when my poor heart is afflicted, when Satan storms, or
the world frowns, when sickness in myself, or when under bereaving
providences for my friends, "all thy waves and storms seem to go over
me;" Oh, what relief is it, to know that Jesus looks on, and
sympathizes! Then do I say to myself, will not Jesus, who wept at the
grave of Lazarus, feel for me? Shah I look up to him, and look up in
vain? Did Jesus, when upon earth, know what those exercises were; and
was his precious soul made sensible of distresses even to tears; and
will he be regardless of what! feel, and the sorrows under which I
groan? Oh no! the sigh that bursts in secret from my heart, is not
secret to him; the tear that on my night couch, drops unperceived and
unknown to the world, is known and numbered by him. Though now exalted
at the right hand of power, where he hath wiped away all tears from off
all faces, yet he himself still retains the feelings and the character
of "the man of sorrows, and of one well acquainted with grief." Help me,
Lord, thus to look up to thee, and thus to remember thee! Oh! that
blessed scripture; "In all their afflictions, he was afflicted; and the
angel of his presence saved them; in his love, and in his pity, he
redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old,"
Isa. lxiii. 9.</p>

8—Morning—Isaiah 43:10</h3>
<p>"Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have
chosen."—Isa. xliii. 10.</p>
<p>Doth God indeed appeal to the souls of his people for the truth of
his covenant love! Oh the gracious condescension! It is sweet, it is
blessed, and a testimony enough to make the heart of every child of God
that possesseth it to leap for joy, when the Spirit witnesseth to our
spirits that we are the children of God. But it is still carrying on
that blessedness with increasing delight, when the people of God
themselves become witnesses of covenant love and faithfulness; and, from
numberless experiences in themselves, can, and do set to their seals
that God is true. See then, my soul, this morning, whether thou art one
of thy God's witnesses, and thy Redeemer, as the servant of Jehovah,
witnesseth for thee, and by his sweet influences in thee, all that thine
heart can wish concerning the word of his grace, and thy fellowship and
communion with him. Run over a few leading points in which thou canst,
and dost bear witness for thy God. Did he not remember thee in thy low
estate, when he passed by, and bid thee live? Did he not convince thee
of sin, and put a cry in thine heart of salvation? Did not God the Holy
Ghost convincingly prove to thee, both the infinite glories and
perfections of Jesus, and by his gracious leadings constrain thee to a
love towards him, dependence upon him, and a perfect approbation of
having him for thy Saviour? Did not Jesus so graciously visit thee, shew
thee his love, his tenderness, his power, his suitableness, his
all-sufficiency, as to warm all thy frozen affections into a warmth for
him and attachment to him. And did not thy God and Father, again and
again, manifest to thee his covenant love, in. accepting thee in Jesus,
blessing thee with all spiritual blessings in him, hearing and answering
prayer, and proving by all these tokens that he is thy God, and that
thou art one of his people? And art thou, my soul day by day looking up
for salvation only in Jesus, and renouncing all other saviours? Dost
thou know all these precious things, my soul, and a thousand more of the
like nature, in which thou art bearing daily testimony to the word of
his grace? Then surely thou art one of those to whom Jehovah appeals in
the blessed scripture of the morning. Think then, my soul, what an
honour thou art called to! What a privilege is thine! See to it, my
soul, that thou witness for Jesus, whom God hath given for a witness to
the people. And while Jesus takes up thy cause before the throne in
heaven, do thou plead his cause, and be valiant for his truth here upon
earth. And do ye, angels of light, and ye spirits of just men made
perfect, witness for me that this Lord is my God.</p>

8—Evening—Hebrews 12:30</h3>
<p>"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
about seven days."—Heb. xii. 30.</p>
<p>Never, in the annals of mankind, in the history of all wars, is there
a parallel instance to be found, of exploits like what the Holy Ghost
hath recorded here, of faith. The walls of a city actually fell down at
the blasting of rams' horns; and yet not from the blasting of horns, but
from faith in the almighty power of Goal. My soul! let thy meditation,
this evening, be directed to the subject, to see whether it will or not,
under divine teaching, give strength to the exercise's of thy faith? We
find, in the relation given of this memorable siege, that no ramparts
were thrown up, no mounds raised, nothing of any human attempt made,
either to sap the foundations, or to harass the enemy. The simple
process adopted to intimate to the besieged the appearance of war, was
an army marching round the walls, once every day, for seven days
together. I have often thought how the despisers of God and his army, in
the city of Jericho, ridiculed the Israelites in their daily exercise.
And what an apt resemblance were they of the despisers, in the present
day, of God and his Christ! But what an effect must have been induced,
when on the seventh day, and after seven times marching round (perhaps
in honour of the sabbath) at the shout of Joshua and his army, the whole
of the walls fell flat to the ground! My soul! such, but in an
infinitely higher degree, will be the consternation of all the enemies
of Jesus, when "he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and admired
in all that believe!" Do not overlook the testimony the Holy Ghost hath
given to this memorable event, that it was wrought" by faith!" And what
cannot faith in Jesus accomplish? Hadst thou been present at this siege,
and beheld the stupendous event, when, at the command of Joshua, the
Israelites shouted, and the walls fell, thou wouldest have seen a sight
not more wonderful and supernatural, than when, at the command of our
new testament Joshua, the Lord Jesus Christ, the weapons of sin fall out
of the hands of the sinner, and the strong holds of Satan give way in
the heart, to the victorious grace of the Spirit. Lord! I would say, in
the review of this subject, increase my faith, and make my soul strong
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus!</p>

9—Morning—Matthew 15:23</h3>
<p>"But he answered her not a word."—Matt. xv. 23.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, this feature in thy Redeemer's conduct towards the
poor woman that so long and so earnestly entreated him—"Jesus answered
her not a word." And yet, from the close of the subject, nothing can be
more evident, than that the Lord had determined, not only to grant her
petition, but to throw the reins of government, concerning herself, into
her hands so completely, that it should be as she would. Learn then from
hence how to interpret silence at the throne upon every occasion of
thine. In every dark providence, under every dispensation of grace,
never forget that Jesus's love is the same. What though he answereth not
a word; yet his whole heart is towards his redeemed. Whatever frowns
there may be in outward things, there can be none in what concerns the
real happiness of his people. Jesus may try, as in the instance of this
poor woman, the graces he gives. Faith may be hard put to it, and
silence at the throne may make temptation and exercises of every kind
more sharp and painful. But Jesus is the same, his love the same, the
merits and efficacy of his blood and righteousness the same. These speak
for thee, my soul, when they may not speak to thee. That is a precious
thought; never forget it. And remember, moreover, covenant mercies are
not suspended upon our deserts. The free grace of God in Christ depends
not upon the will or the worth of man; according to the beautiful
account by the prophet of the rain or dew of heaven, which waiteth not
for man, neither tarrieth for the sons of men. Henceforth, therefore, my
soul, do thou learn to wait at the mercy-seat as cheerful, and with as
lively actings of faith, when Jesus answereth not a word, as when thy
petitions are all complied with. "Men ought always to pray, and not to
faint," saith one that could not be mistaken. Oh for grace and faith to
take God at his word, and like Job to say, "Though he slay me, yet will
I trust in him."</p>

<p>"By faith, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
when she had received the spies with peace."—Heb. xi. 31.</p>
<p>It were a pity to disconnect what. the Holy Ghost hath joined; and as
the relation of the destruction accomplished by faith on the walls of
Jericho, is followed in the scripture history, with an account of a
deliverance, from the same principle, in this wonderful woman, who was
an harlot, do thou, my soul, let thy last evening's meditation on the
one, he followed up in this, by the exercise of thy devout thoughts on
the other; for both are expressly intended to one and the same purpose,
which is to encourage the Lord's people to be "followers of them, who
now, through faith and patience, inherit the promises." What
extraordinary events are there in the scripture account of Rahab, the
harlot; that such a woman, and an harlot, should be distinguished with
such grace! That in such a city, even an accursed city, the Lord should
have so illustrious an instance of faith! That faith so illustrious
should be found in the heart of an harlot! And that the eminency and
greatness of it should be such, that God the Holy Ghost hath thought
proper to have it recorded, both in its principle and effects, by the
apostle Paul, in one epistle, and by the apostle James in another. Yea,
and what is more marvellous still, that our Lord, after the flesh,
should arise out of such a stock! Oh! what a world of wonders is folded
up in the great plan of salvation! But while thou art beholding the
wonders of grace in the instance of this woman, and admiring the triumph
of faith wrought in her, do not fail to connect with it the still more
blessed view of Him who is the author and finisher of faith, and from
whom, and in whom, and by whom, the whole is accomplished. Precious
Jesus! it is all by thee, and thy glorious undertaking, that Rahab, the
gentile, found faith to believe, while the spies of Israel doubted. It
was thou, and thy grace, O Lord, that wrought so effectually, and
therefore be thou eternally loved and adored in this rich dispensation
of thy mercy, that Rahab the harlot perished not with them that believed
not. Oh! thou bountiful Lord! publicans and harlots, thou hast said, go
into the kingdom of God, before the self-righteous pharisees!</p>

10—Morning—Colossians 1:17</h3>
<p>"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."—Col. i.
17.</p>
<p>How doth the apostle mean that Jesus is before all things? Not as God
only, for then the observation would have been needless; and not as man
only, for then how could all things consist by him? What is it then, my
soul? Is it not as Mediator, both God and man? And was not Christ thus
set up from everlasting? Not openly revealed indeed, neither openly
manifested in a body of flesh, until the fulness of time; but secretly,
and in the divine counsels. What a blessed thought for the redeemed to
exercise their rapturous meditations upon! And is it not this which the
apostle hath said;" He is the image of the invisible God?" The image!
Yes, that representation of what is in itself invisible; that identical
image concerning which Jehovah when calling Adam into existence, said,
"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." So then Adam was the
first man indeed openly, but not so secretly; for it is plain that Adam
was made after this likeness which was set up from everlasting. Hence
this union of natures, subsisting in one person, formed the one glorious
Mediator, who is, and was, before all things, and by whom all things
consist. Here is the foundation then of the church, and that from
everlasting: without this, the church, and indeed all things beside, had
wanted foundation. For there is nothing created that can stand out of
God; and there was nothing created that could stand in God, by a
personal union, but him. What a glorious thought! Cherish it, my soul!
Never lose sight of it. In Christ the Mediator, all things consist. The
church is preserved, redeemed, sanctified, glorified: and how are all
his redeemed ones personally and individually secured, but by the same?
By him all things consist. Hence their consisting is in him; they are
living in him, feeding on him, made righteous in his righteousness, and
hereafter will be glorified in his glory. My soul, think what a world of
mysteries thou art in; think what an unspeakable life, is a life of
grace here; think what a world of glory in Jesus hereafter. Now see if
thou canst better enter into an apprehension of those divine words of
Jesus: "Because I live, ye shall live also." And again: "At that day ye
shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you."</p>

<p>"How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!"—Song vii.

<p>My soul! thou hast been refreshed, many an evening, through grace, in
beholding thy Lord, both in his person, and in his comprehensive fulness
for his redeemed; nor wilt thou be without refreshment this evening, if
thy Lord, in his sweet influences, be with thee, to make what is said in
this lovely scripture, life and spirit in thine heart. They are the
words of Jesus; and they express the love and complacency of delight
which Jesus takes in his church. Surely nothing can be more blessed,
than to see the high value the Son of God puts upon the church, which
the Father gave him, endeared as it is yet more in being the purchase of
his blood! But what astonishment is it to the soul of a poor sinner, to
be told, and by the lip of truth, that sinners are fair in Jesus's eyes!
"Thou art fair, O love, yea, pleasant." Now remember, my soul, and in
that remembrance let Jesus have all the glory, that this loveliness and
beauty in the sinner, of every degree, that is regenerated, and made
anew in Christ, is from Jesus. It is wholly from his righteousness, in
which he beholds her clothed: "I washed thee with water, (saith the
Lord) and I decked thee also with ornaments; and thy renown went forth
among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my
comeliness which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God," Ezek. xvi.
5-14. My soul! bow down under the conviction of all that remains of
indwelling inbred sin; and, in language like that of the astonished
apostle, cry out, 'Lord! how is it that thou hast set thy love upon
creatures so polluted and unworthy; and dost "manifest thyself to them
otherwise than thou dost to the world?"'</p>

11—Morning—John 4:10</h3>
<p>"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,
Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have
given thee living water."—John iv. 10.</p>
<p>Amidst a thousand precious things concerning Jesus, there are two
views of him which are peculiarly so, and which those words of his to
the woman of Samaria bring home to the heart in the plainest and most
blessed manner. The one is, who, and what, Christ is in himself; and the
other is, the Father's authority in him, so as to give faith in him a
divine warrant to act by, when a poor sinner comes to make use of
Christ. It is our ignorance in those two grand points concerning
salvation, which is the sad cause of all our miseries and the little
enjoyment even gracious souls, for the most part, have in Jesus. Now, my
soul, do thou meditate upon both these things this morning, and from
these sweet words of thy Saviour see if thou dost not prove what he so
graciously saith to be true. First, consider who, and what Jesus is, as
he is in himself. Let thy faith have for its object of meditation, the
Person, and the work of God thy Saviour. In all he wrought, in all he
did, in all he accomplished, it was as the Surety of his people. And in
all the fulness, by virtue of it, which is treasured up in him; it is
not for himself, for he cannot need it, but it is for his people. So
that a poor sinner is as much suited to Jesus for him to give out of his
fulness, as Jesus is suited for a poor sinner to supply his emptiness.
And therefore, if we did but thus know him, and thus come to him, we
should find that he is as earnest to receive every poor sinner, and to
give out of his fulness, as that poor sinner can be to come and take.
Now, my soul, when thou hast duly pondered over this, look at Jesus in
the other point of view also as the gift of God. Here thou hast a
warrant, an authority; nay, a command, to come to Jesus, and to make use
of him, for every want which poverty, ignorance, and sin have occasioned
in the circumstances of our fallen nature. Christ is the one blessed
ordinance of heaven; Christ is the one, and the only one, appointed way,
for a poor sinner's acceptance with God. And therefore, did a poor
sinner always keep in view that Christ is the gift of God; and that God
is honoured, when that poor sinner honours his dear Son, by believing
the record God hath given of him; would not this make every poor sinner
happy, in thus glorifying God? And therefore, my soul, look to it, that
this is thy daily exercise; for then thy thirst for Jesus will not be
supplied, as from a pool, which depends upon dry or wet seasons; but
Jesus himself will give thee living water: nay, Jesus will himself be
that everlasting living spring in thee, which springeth up into
everlasting life.</p>

11—Evening—Psalm 68:9</h3>
<p>"Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm
thine inheritance when it was weary."—Ps. lxviii. 9.</p>
<p>How truly grateful are the falling showers upon the thirsty earth,
after a hot summer's day, such as this season of the year abounds with!
Such, my soul, (and thou knowest it, I hope, in the many refreshments
thou hast had) is Jesus, in the visits of his grace! "He shall come like
rain," was the sweet promise given to old testament saints, "upon the
mown grass, as showers that water the earth," Ps. lxxii. 6. And every
new testament believer hath, more or less, a real personal enjoyment of
it. Sometimes the Lord comes as the tender dew, for he saith himself," I
will be as the dew unto Israel," Hosea xiv. 5. And hast thou not found
thy Lord, not unfrequently, so to come? silent and unperceived for a
while; yea, at times, when wholly unlooked for, unasked, unsought! Yes!
thou dearest Jesus, thou tarriest not for man's desert, neither waitest
thou for their prepared state to receive thee! Micah v. 7. And
sometimes, as this blessed portion for the evening expresseth it, the
Lord comes in a "plentiful rain;" even showers of his love, washing away
"the filth of the daughter of Zion," and cleansing every thing that is
polluted; as the natural clouds pour their fulness, which wash off the
insects from the vegetable creation, and purify the air from noxious
vapours. And when my God and Saviour thus comes to his people, how doth
he make the wilderness-frames of their dry and languishing minds to
blossom as the rose! So come, Lord Jesus, I beseech thee, on my soul,
and not on mine only, but on thy churches, thy ministers, thy people!
But, my soul, do not dismiss this charming scripture, until thou hast
first gathered another blessed instruction from it, for it is most
blessed. The words say, that Jehovah sends this plentiful rain, whereby
he "confirmed his inheritance when it was weary." And doth not this most
abundantly prove, that Christ, with all his fulness, and all his graces,
is the sent of God the Father? "We have seen and do testify (said John,
the beloved apostle)that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of
the world," 1 John iv. 14. Oh! precious, precious scripture! Do I not
read in it the grace, and love, and mercy of all the persons of the
Godhead? Surely, Almighty Father! thou dost confirm all thy covenant
faithfulness, when thou dost send thy dear Son to the souls of thy
people! Thou dost, indeed, both confirm thy truth, and refresh their
weary, dry, and thirsty souls, when Jesus comes to bless them, in the
dew of his grace, and in the showers of his love and mercy!</p>

12—Morning—Mark 5:17</h3>
<p>"And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts."—Mark v.
17.</p>
<p>And was this Jesus whom they desired to depart? Yes: and what had the
Redeemer done to merit this treatment? He had dispossessed the evil
spirit from the mind of a poor creature, and caused the whole country to
be freed from the fury of one whom no chains could bind: was this the
cause? Yes. And is it possible that so divine an act could have had such
an effect upon the minds of a whole body of people? What, would these
Gadarenes rather have the devil ranging among them, in the person of
this poor creature, than the Son of God in the kindness of our nature?
Pause, my soul: is it not the same now? Do not men still prefer the
raging uncontrolled lusts of their own hearts, the dominion of Satan,
and the customs, pursuits, and follies, of the world; to the grace,
mercy, and sweet dominion of Jesus? Do they not indeed, if not in words,
say, "Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways?" Pause
again, my soul. Was there not a time when the same was thy case? Indeed
there was. And is not every one so by nature? And what but an act of
grace, like the miracle Jesus wrought on this poor man, can bring any
one out of it? Art thou, my soul, brought out of it? Yes, if so be, like
him, thou art now sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in thy
right mind. Surely, Lord, thou hast wrought this blessed change upon me!
Could I desire thee to depart out of our coasts? Nay, is it not the
daily, hourly desire of my heart, that thou wouldest be with me, dwell
in me, reign and rule in me, and be my portion, my God, my Saviour, and
make me thine for ever? Sweet testimony, in the midst of all my
wanderings, coldness, undeservings! Cherish it, my soul! Jesus will not
depart from thee. That love which brought him down from heaven to save a
world, led him over the lake of Genesareth to save one poor sinner. And
he who came in love unsent for, departed not until he was sent away. Oh
ye poor blind, deluded, Gadarenes! Oh my poor, equally blind and deluded
countrymen and fellow-sinners, who know not, nor desire to know Christ
Jesus! Who are ye that thus reject the Lord of life and glory, and
desire him to depart out of your coasts?</p>

12—Evening—Judges 2:5</h3>
<p>"And they called the name of that place Bochim."—Judges ii. 5.</p>
<p>Surely it was enough to induce such an effect, when the preaching of
an angel informed the people, that the Lord, for their sins, would not
drive out their enemies before them. The place might well be called
Bochim, and they themselves might hear the name Bochim, weepers. But, my
soul, thou hast lately been to a place which is yet more calculated to
make it memorable, by weeping, when thou didst attend Jesus at the
ordinance of his supper. For there Jesus himself was, and is, the
everlasting preacher, who sheweth thee his hands and his side, pierced
and streaming with blood, for thy sins. Didst thou not hear him speak to
thee himself, in his own words, "They shall look upon me whom they have
pierced: and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son,
and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his
first-born?" Zech. xii. 10. Didst thou not weep in beholding such a
sight, in hearing such words, and in meditating on such things? Alas!
Lord, my heart is harder than the adamant. But if the eye wept not; say,
was not my heart broken? Did I not desire to feel, to mourn, and, with
the prophet, to cry out: "Oh! that mine head were waters, and mine eyes
a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night," in the
recollection of my Redeemer's sufferings, and my sins, the dreadful
cause of them? Did Jesus die for me! Did the Son of God offer up his
precious soul and offering for me? Was his body broken, and his blood
shed for me? For me! a poor, wretched, polluted, hell-deserving sinner?
Oh! for grace to make every place a Bochim in the recollection; and
especially at the table of Jesus, may my soul always find these
ordinance-seasons heart-melting seasons. Here would I frequently attend,
to have my soul thoroughly awakened, and my stony heart made flesh. Here
would I go, to gather a holy hatred to my sins, which brought Jesus to
the cross. Here would I be found waiting, that when any new temptation
may arise, I may cry out, with a vehement indignation, "How can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God?" How can I "crucify the Son
of God afresh, and put him to an open shame?" Precious Lord Jesus! do
thou help me to keep the eye of my soul stedfastly fixed on thee, and
all the affections of my soul to be going out in desires after thee; to
be "always bearing about in my body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
the life also of the Lord Jesus may he made manifest in my body!"</p>

13—Morning—Jeremiah 28:16</h3>
<p>"This year thou shalt die."—Jer. xxviii. 16.</p>
<p>I have often thought this passage, pronounced on the lying prophet, a
most suitable sermon for a birthday portion, to be sounded in the ears
of the sinner: and if qualified with the possibility and probability
which arise out of our dying circumstances, it might, when commissioned
by the Lord, have a blessed effect. My soul, take it for the meditation
of thy birth-day. It may be fulfilled this year; it must be fulfilled
some year; it cannot be a very distant year; and there is a birth-day
when it shall be passed upon thee in the year. And why not the present?
Pause, my soul, and meditate upon it, as if this were the very year. And
what though carnal men celebrate the anniversary of their birth-day, as
best suited to their carnal minds, let thine be wholly spiritual. If
indeed a man came into the world laughing, there might be a suitable
correspondence in commemorating the annual return of such a birth with
laughing. But if cries first indicated the birth of a poor helpless
creature, born to want, and the subject of sin and misery; can rioting
and folly be the proper celebration of such an event? And is there no
joy suitable on the return of a man's birthday? Oh yes, there is, and
ought to be, real heal-felt joy with every child of God. When a man
begins to count birth-days in grace, every return calls for holy joy in
the Holy Ghost. Not for that he was born an intelligent immortal
creature only, but for that he was made a new creature in Christ Jesus.
Not for that he came into the world in a state of nature only, but that
he was brought also into a state of grace. Not for that he was of the
stock and lineage of Adam only, but of the seed of Christ. Here is an
alliance royal, holy, heavenly, divine! My soul, how many moons or years
in the new life canst thou mark down? Let this be the arithmetic in thy
calculation. And if, like the herald of the morning, the voice should
say, "This year thou shalt die:" Oh how sweet to answer, Lord, my times
are in thine hands! Can they be in a wiser, or more tender, or more
loving hand than Jesus's? Precious Lord, wean me from every thing here
below, that I may be living nearer with thee, and in thee, and to thee;
that as the last year of my pilgrimage lessens to the month, and the
month to the week, and the week to the day, nay to the very hour and
moment of my departure from a body of sin and death, the last expiring
words on my trembling lips may be of Jesus; and thine, Oh Lord, come
home with power and sweetness to my soul, like thine to him upon the
cross: "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise."</p>

13—Evening—Psalm 4:8</h3>
<p>"I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only
makest me dwell in safety."—Ps. iv. 8.</p>
<p>My soul! it is blessed, indeed, to lie down, or arise, when Jesus is
thy rest and refreshment! But, void of security and safety in him, both
the day-light and the darkness have their horrors. And how unsatisfying
is every thing where Jesus is not? This is strikingly exemplified, day
by day, among all carnal characters. "There be many," saith the Psalmist
(in this divine psalm), "there be many that say, who will shew us any
good?" Yea, the whole world, who know not the blessedness of Jesus, will
thus say! What a busy life some men make of it? And what is it for? Be
their pursuits what they may; let them be ever so much diversified, one
object is the aim of all. The apostle hath said what it is;" to make
provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof," Rom. xiii. 14. My
soul! what is the first and last, the greatest and most momentous desire
of thine affections? Canst thou, and dost thou, adopt the words of the
Psalmist, in this sweet psalm: "Lord! lift thou up the light of thy
countenance upon me: and it shall put more gladness in my heart than in
the time that corn and wine increase?" Oh! the blessedness of such a
state! May it be mine! Dearest Lord Jesus! grant it me, day by day; and
in the evening and night watches, let thy sweet visits be unceasingly
renewing: and then will I take this precious portion for my song, both
when undressing for the bed of sleep, and the bed of death: "I will lay
me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in
safety!"</p>

14—Morning—Job 1:19</h3>
<p>"And I only am escaped alone to tell thee."—Job i. 19.</p>
<p>My soul, is there nothing in this account which the messenger to Job
gave concerning himself which suits thy case and circumstances? Nay,
mayest thou not in a great variety of ways, both in providence and
grace, adopt similar language, in which thou art escaped alone to tell?
Pause! look back to thy boyish days. Nay, look further back, even to the
birth, and to the womb; for had not the Lord carried thee from thence,
surely from the womb wouldest thou have died and given up the ghost. And
what was thy childhood, but years of perils and dangers, in which
multitudes dropped all around thee, so that thou mightest say, while
contemplating them, "and I only am escaped alone to tell thee?" And
where are numbers with whom the stages of thy youth, and years at school
were spent? Where are they? May it not here again be said, "And I only
am escaped alone to tell thee?" Go on, and trace the wonderful history
in the eventful path of riper years: through what sicknesses, pains and
deaths hast thou passed; and mayest thou not, my soul, here again cry
out," And I only am escaped alone to tell?" Oh the wonders of
distinguishing love, even in common providences, towards his people,
before that the highlyfavoured objects have any consciousness how that
love is watching over them, and whereby they are preserved to the day of
their calling! Who shall count the sum of distinguishing mercy, in
preserving and upholding providences, during the whole of an unconverted
state! My soul, hadst thou died in any one of these perilous seasons,
and how very near sometimes hath death seemed, the language of Job's
messenger would not then have been thine as it is now; "And I only am
escaped alone to tell thee." Pause once more. Art thou now, my soul,
indeed escaped to tell of converting grace? Canst thou now look round,
and amidst the dying and the dead in trespasses and sins, unawakened,
unconcerned, unregenerated; canst thou indeed say, "And I only am
escaped alone to tell thee!" Oh then, my soul, proclaim with earnestness
the glorious truth. Invite all, as far as thy sphere of information can
reach, as if thou, and thou alone, weft escaped to tell of the wonders
of redeeming love; and let thy daily language be: "Oh come hither, and
hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what he hath done for
my soul."</p>

Corinthians 11:26</h3>
<p>"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
the Lord's death till he come."—I Cor. xi. 26.</p>
<p>An evening or two since, my mind was led out to the contemplation of
the supper of the Lord, as a heartaffecting ordinance, to make the
Lord's table a Bochim. I hope, my soul, that in this view, thou didst
find it profitable. Here is another proposed to thy meditation, which,
under grace, will prove equally so, in which it comes home to thy
affections as a subject of holy joy. Look at it in this light, and
remark what the apostle saith upon it. The Lord's death, which is thy
life, is set forth by every renewed celebration. And what a delightful
thought is that. As the body needs its constant regular meals, so doth
the soul. And as Jesus is the whole of life, and strength, and happiness
to his people; as oft as we receive the holy supper, we testify to the
world of men and angels, that he is all this; and we glory in setting
him forth as such at his table. And what a blessed addition is that
little phrase at the end of this verse; "till he come:" yea, that "when
he comes," he may find his people at his table, and in their death
celebrating his. Oh the blessedness of being so found! Surely every
lover of Jesus would desire to be found there, when the master comes,
and calleth personally for each, to take him home: to be, in one and the
same moment, in the valley of vision, and the valley of the shadow of
death! My soul! from henceforth, among the other glories of the
ordinance, do not forget this. The oftener it is attended, the more
delightful it will be. For the service keeps the remembrance of Jesus
alive in the soul, until he comes to take the soul home to the
everlasting enjoyment of himself in glory. And as there, all his
redeemed, who feast their souls with the view of his person, unceasingly
behold some new glories in him, and, after millions of ages, will find
him still increasingly lovely, and increasingly precious; so here below,
the more we see him, and know him, and enjoy him by faith, the more we
shall long to see him, and know him, and enjoy him by sight: and the
glories of his person, and the wonders of his blood and righteousness,
will be unfolding more and more to our ravished souls. And while every
other object lessens in its value by time and use, and all created
excellencies, like the planet under which they are found, have their
growing and their waning seasons; Jesus is the same, "yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever." Yea, though in reality always the same, yet from
the increasing manifestations of love and glory which he makes of
himself to us, as our capacities are capable of bearing, he will be in
our view more and more blessed, from day to day, from one ordinance to
another, and through all the unknown periods of eternity! Oh! the
blessedness of setting forth Jesus, "in breaking bread and in
prayer!"</p>

15—Morning—Psalm 119:136</h3>
<p>"Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
law."—Ps. cxix. 136.</p>
<p>Who is there of whom this may be said? Jesus, and Jesus only. He wept
indeed over his beloved Jerusalem, for he was a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief. And the love he had to his redeemed, induced a
bloody sweat through all the pores of his sacred body. But of every
other may it not be said, "All seek their own, not the things which are
Jesus Christ's." Did we truly love Zion, would not rivers of tears run
down at the present languishing state of Zion? Did we feel the full
sense of distinguishing grace, would not every heart mourn over the
ruins of our common nature? Think, my soul, what a mass of sin ascends
as a cloud before the view of the Lord every day from a single heart of
the desperately wicked transgressor? Think what an accumulation in a
town, a province, an empire, the world! Might not rivers of waters run
down at the contemplation? And worse, if possible! Think of that higher
source of sorrow, in that the only possible remedy for this evil is
slighted, and Christ, which is God's one gracious ordinance for the
recovery of our ruined nature, is so little esteemed among men. Oh how
might the people of God be supposed to have their very souls melted in
the contemplation! This, this is indeed the condemnation; this is the
soul-destroying sin; "that light is come into the world, and men love
darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil." Oh for grace
to mourn over a Christ-despising generation! Oh for the "Deliverer to
arise out of Zion, and turn away ungodliness from Jacob."</p>

<p>"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is
said to this day, in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen."—Gen. xxii.
14.</p>
<p>My soul! how many Jehovah-jirehs hast thou erected? At least, how
many occasions hath thy bountiful Lord afforded thee for erecting them?
Oh what cause have I to blush in the recollection! Had I done by my God,
as Abraham did by his, what blessed helps would they have afforded me,
in the same moment that they became monuments to the Lord's praise!
Surely I know all this, in theory, very plainly and fully: but how do I
fall short in the practice of it! To set up the Jehovah-jireh for all
that is past, is the best help to a soul in exercises for all that is to
come. When I can, and do put down, after any sharp trial, any
Jehovah-jireh, and say, here it was "the Lord did provide;" will it not,
in any future exercise, enable me to say, 'If the Lord helped me then,
may I not hope that he will help me now?' It would be a very sad
requital for past mercies, in the moment of receiving them, to say,
'Alas! the Lord did once help, but he will not. I fear, do it again.'
This would be to read the inscription of the Jehovah-jireh backward.
Whereas the very sight of our Jehovah-jirehs should teach us to say,
"Here the Lord helped me: here he manifested his free unmerited grace to
me: and will he not again? Is he less Jehovah than he was? Is he not God
all-sufficient, all-gracious still?" O it is blessed to have such stones
set up as Abraham's Jehovah-jireh. There was nothing in the patriarch's
of his own providing. His was simply an act of faith; and neither the
result of his asking by prayer, or providing by his wisdom. And, my
soul, do not overlook a most interesting mark which the Holy Ghost hath
put upon Abraham's Jehovah-jireh, in adding, "As it is said to this day,
in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen." As if he had said, ' all the
ages and generations yet to come shall profit by the great father of the
faithful's testimony to this place; and they shall see it to the latest
day of Jesus's church upon earth? Oh! how blessed, when our personal
experience bears an exact correspondence to that of the faithful gone
before; when we can and do set up the same. All blessings, all
provisions are in Jesus. He is the Lamb, which, from everlasting,
Jehovah hath provided, and whom his people shall see in all their wants,
temporal, spiritual, and eternal. And let their extremities be what they
may, yea, though the exercises of their faith abound, yet let them wait
but the Lord's time, which is always the best time, and they shall most
assuredly, like Abraham, find cause to call the name of every place of
trial, Jehovah-jireh; concerning which, in proof and in reality it shall
be said, every day and to the last day," In the mount of the Lord it
shall be seen!"</p>

<p>"I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God
over one sinner that repenteth."—Luke xv. 10.</p>
<p>What a precious information is this which the Son of God hath given
of heaven's joy over every individual instance of the recovery of our
poor fallen nature! Surely if angels of light thus participate in the
triumphs of our Jesus; well may sinners rejoice over sinners, whenever a
single one is awakened from darkness to light, and converted from the
power of sin and Satan unto God. Think, ye ministers of my God, what
motives arise out of this thought to stir up your most earnest exertions
in labouring in the word and doctrine! Ought it not to be the first and
most importunate petition at the mercy-seat whenever entering upon your
labours, that, by the Lord's blessing upon you, new causes might arise
to call forth this joy in heaven? Nay, ought it not to be the fervent
prayer and hope of faith, at the close of those labours, and especially
every Lord's day, that some souls may have been awakened, and angels may
have rejoiced through your instrumentality? Can there be a prayer more
interesting upon earth, than when the servant of Jesus saith, 'Lord,
crown my labours this day with success?' And can there be a subject to
call forth more animated praise than when at the close of a sabbath, you
look up and say, 'Lord, have angels rejoiced this day over the
conversion of any poor sinner in this congregation?' And no less, ye
parents and guardians of the rising generation, should the same hope
prompt you to wrestle in prayer with God for the sanctification of your
household. Go on, and hope that answers are coming down to your earnest
requests. Perhaps the next joy in heaven may be over one for whom you
have now prayed! Precious Jesus, it is enough. I bless thee, Lord, for
this, among a thousand other proofs of thy care over us, that the
salvation of poor sinners adds new joy to the felicity of heaven, and
that there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth.</p>

16—Evening—Psalm 110:7</h3>
<p>"He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up
the head."—Ps. cx. 7.</p>
<p>The brook of Kedron was a black brook (for so the word Kedron
signifies) into which all the filth from the sacrifices was thrown; it
was the brook over which the Son of God passed in the night that he
entered the garden of Gethsemane. Now, as the whole Psalm from which
this portion is taken, refers to the person of Jesus, nothing can be
more plain than that David, by the spirit of prophecy, is here
describing the deep sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow. By the expression, drinking of this black brook, it is intended
to convey an idea of the "cup of trembling" put into the Lord Jesus's
hands, when he sustained all the sins and filth of his people, and in
consequence as their surety, all the Father's wrath against sin. Hence
the Lord said, "The cup that my Father giveth me, shall I not drink it?"
My soul! pause, and ask thyself, doth not this sweet but solemn verse
give thee precious instruction, when thou considerest that all thy
filth, and all thy defilements, were imputed, by the Father himself,
unto the person of thy glorious surety? Is it not blessed thus to see,
that by Christ's drinking "of the brook in the way," he took all thy
transgressions, and was made both "sin and a curse for thee, that thou
mightest be made the righteousness of God in him?" And though, in
himself, he was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and
made higher than the heavens," yet, as the surety of his people, he was
made black with sin and suffering; "his visage was marred more than any
man, and his form more than the sons of men." Precious Jesus! may I
never lose sight of Gethsemane, the mount of Olives, and the brook
Kedron! Here, by faith, let my soul frequently take her evening station,
and behold thee "pouring out thy soul unto death, numbered with the
transgressors," drinking "of the brook in the way," that thy sacred head
might be lifted up, first on the cross in suffering, and then with thy
crown in glory!</p>

<p>How shall I ever sufficiently enter into an apprehension of the love
of Jesus? Much less, how shall I ever sufficiently love thee, and adore
thee, thou unequalled pattern of excelling love, blessed, precious
Jesus? Was it not enough to have given such palpable evidences of thy
love in dying for poor sinners; but must thou tell them also before thy
departure the cause for which thou art gone away, and to give them an
assurance, at the same time, that thou wouldest come again, and take
them home with thee to glory? Oh help me, Lord, to love thee, to live to
thee, to be always on the look out for thee, and to rejoice with a joy
unspeakable in the promise of thy coming. And, my soul, while thou art
taking all the sweetness of those precious words of thy Jesus to
thyself, in the prospect of his shortly coming to take thee to himself,
let them also have their full comfort under any bereaving providences of
thy friends. Wouldest thou regret if an earthly king had conceived such
a love to any friend of thine, that he had sent for him to advance him
to some high dignity, to make him his favourite, and to load him with
honours? Considered as to earthly accommodations, would this advancement
of some near and dear friend of thine be distressing to thee, because
thou wert to see him no more? Nay, would not the generosity of the
prince be highly extolled by thee; and more especially if the messengers
which came to fetch thy friend, brought with them a promise, that, ere
long, a royal guard would be sent to take thee also, to live with thy
friend for ever, in the king's palace, and under the king's eye, both
enjoying the royal favour? But what would all this fading, dying,
perishing, and uncertain grandeur be, to that which Jesus promiseth in
these blessed words of the morning? And hath Jesus taken any of thine
home to his glory? Are they now at the fountain head of blessedness, and
art thou weeping over their breathless remains? Raise up, my soul, thy
thoughts from earth to heaven. Hear the voice that speaks, "Blessed are
the dead which die in the Lord." Keep up the constant expectation of
thine own call. Walk as on the borders of the invisible world. And above
all, so watch the daily, hourly, visits of Jesus, by his grace, and
enjoy the sweet communion and fellowship in spirit, by which he now
speaks to his people, and they to him, that when Jesus draws back the
curtain of thy bed at death, and appears to thy ravished view in all his
glory, thou mayest leave the trembling body, and run to his embraces,
crying out, "My Lord, and my God."</p>

17—Evening—Acts 24:25</h3>
<p>"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
come, Felix trembled."—Acts xxiv. 25.</p>
<p>And wherefore did Felix tremble? Did Paul, who was then preaching to
him, charge him with any particular sins? It doth not appear that he
did. Neither is it probable that a poor prisoner would have been
permitted so to have done. But the truth is, God's holy word, by Paul's
preaching, and the man's own guilty conscience, which Felix himself
applied, so met together, that the conscious sinner could not refrain.
The very thought of a future judgment, and a day of account, crossing
the mind of a guilty conscience, will be enough to damp the mirth of the
stoner in the midst of his jollity. Every man, more or less, must have
thoughts now and then of an hereafter. Man, by nature, is a creature
compelled to look forward. He is forever proposing to himself prospects
that are to arise. Hence, men of the world are sending out into the
highways and lanes of the city, to invite men like themselves to kill
time, and to gild the passing hour; and while they can do this, fill up
the moment, and drown thought, it is all very well. But when the idea of
a judgment to come riseth within, and the very apprehension that things
will not always be as they now are, starts up; the alarm, like the
hand-writing upon the wall of the impious monarch, instantly takes
effect, and a trembling follows. Dan. v. 5. My soul! learn hence (and if
well learned, it will be a blessed improvement of thine evening's
meditation) that outward circumstances, be they what they may, go but a
little way to give inward comfort. It matters not what men possess, if
those possessions have not the sanctifying blessing of the Lord upon
them. Where Jesus is not, there can be no real enjoyment. All the world
of creature comforts are not sufficient to afford real happiness. Hence
Felix, a governor, trembled, while Paul, a prisoner, rejoiced. Hence,
many an aching heart, in a noble house. Shall not such views endear
Jesus to thee, my soul, still more? Shall they not make thee very cheery
over thy comforts; and make thee truly jealous that thou wilt not allow
thyself one enjoyment where Jesus is not first seen in that enjoyment,
and where he doth not sweeten and form the whole of it? Make him the sum
and substance of all blessedness, and then thou wilt find that godliness
indeed is profitable to all things; "it hath the promise of the life
that now is, and of that which is to come!"</p>

18—Morning—Song of Solomon 2:15</h3>
<p>"Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our
vines have tender grapes."—Song ii. 15.</p>
<p>My soul, mark the sweetness and tenderness of this precept. Foxes no
doubt resemble, in this scripture, the subtle, less open, less
discovered sins and corruptions which lurk in us, like these cunning
creatures, under a covering, and perhaps sometimes under a fair
covering. Moreover, they may mean also false but fair teachers. "Oh
Israel," said the Lord, "thy prophets are like the foxes in the
deserts;" crafty, designing, malignant, and filthy. And in proportion as
they put on a more fair and specious appearance, the more are they to be
dreaded. Satan never more artfully, nor perhaps more effectually
deceives, than when he is transformed into an angel of light. Moreover,
the precept is enforced by that important consideration, that vines, by
which no doubt are meant believers, have tender grapes. What more tender
than a weak conscience? And what more liable to be wounded than the
tender principles of young beginners in a life of grace? My soul, look
up to Jesus, the Lord of the vineyard, for grace to be on the look out
against these destructive enemies to thy welfare. And, conscious that
all thy vigilance, without his watchful eye over thee, would never
protect thee from foes so shrewd and artful, beg of Jesus himself to
take these foxes for thee, and destroy them before thine eyes. Lord, I
would say, keep me from every enemy which doth evil in thy sanctuary,
and preserve alive, in flourishing circumstances, all those tender
graces of thy Spirit bestowed upon me, that I may bring forth fruit to
the praise of thy holy name, and may flourish and spread abroad as the
cedar in Lebanon."</p>

18—Evening—Luke 22:15</h3>
<p>"And he said unto them, with desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you, before I suffer."—Luke xxii. 15.</p>
<p>My soul! thy Jesus holds a feast of the ordinance of his supper; that
most interesting service, which he hath appointed in his church as a
standing memorial of his death, until his second coming. Surely, thou
canst need nothing more endearing, to prompt thee to attend it, than
what the Lord himself expressed of his own pleasure in it, in these
words. There is somewhat uncommonly affectionate in them: they seem to
open and unfold the whole heart of the Redeemer upon the occasion. And
do not forget, that what Jesus then said to his disciples, he saith now
to thee, and to all his redeemed; they were the representatives of his
whole body, the church. Listen to what Jesus here saith, and regard
every word in this most tender and affectionate request, as if Jesus in
person were now speaking to thee, in prospect of the coming supper:"
With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you, now I have
suffered, and have accomplished redemption by my blood!" Pause over the
blessed view, and trace the wonderful desires of Jesus from everlasting,
which he all along manifested towards his people. His goings forth for
the salvation of his people have been from everlasting. He saith
himself, that "while as yet Jehovah had not made the earth, nor the
fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world; that then his
delights were with the sons of men!" Prov. viii. 22-31. And how did the
Lord Jesus manifest his desires towards his people, as soon as
creation-work took place, in all those appearances he made of himself to
them, from the garden of Eden, to his openly tabernacling among them in
the substance of our flesh? What were all those manifestations we read
of, sometimes in the form of man, and sometimes of an angel, but to tell
his church, his redeemed, that with desire he desired for the fulness of
time to arrive, when he would become their passover, and suffer for
them? And is not the desire of Jesus after the conversion of every poor
sinner, whom the Father hath given to him, now as earnest, and as
affectionate as ever? Doth he not wait to be gracious? Doth he not long
for their recovery from sin and Satan, and to bring his prisoners out of
the prison-house? And when they are brought, by his Holy Spirit, which
he puts within them, into the liberty wherewith he makes his people
free, doth he not delight in their company, seek to allure them to
ordinances, call upon them by his word, by his providences, by all his
dispensations, to manifest himself to them otherwise than he doth to the
world? Dost thou not know somewhat of those precious things, my soul?
And if so, shall Jesus say, as he doth in those blessed words to his
disciples, in the evening of his agonies in the garden, "With desire I
have desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer?" And wilt
thou not be among the first to attend thy Jesus at his table? Oh!
bountiful Lord! I beseech thee, let this view of thy desires quicken
mine, and let my whole soul, With all her affections, be earnestly going
forth after thee, that I may say with one of old, "O send out thy light,
and thy truth; let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy holy hill,
and to thy tabernacles; then will I go unto the new testament altar of
my God, even unto Jesus, my God, my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp of
my warmest affections will I praise thee, O God, my God," Ps. xliii. 3,
4.</p>

19—Morning—John 15:5</h3>
<p>"Without me ye can do nothing."—John xv. 5.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus, I know this in theory, from thy gracious teachings, as
well as I know that I am by nature a sinner; but I am for ever failing
in this knowledge, when I come to put it into practice. Teach me, Lord,
how to preserve the constant remembrance of it upon my mind, that I may
never go forth to the holy warfare to subdue a single foe but in thy
strength, and never make mention of any thing but thy righteousness, and
thine only. Be convinced, my soul, every day, more and more, of this
most precious truth, and behold it proved from all the circumstances
around thee. See and remark the total inability either of God's
judgments or God's mercies to induce the least alteration upon the heart
of man, without his grace. Behold the prosperous sinner bathing in a
full river of blessings, himself in health, his circumstances
flourishing, his children like olive-branches round his table, wealth
pouring in upon him from every quarter; and yet he lives without God,
and without Christ in the world; and as he lives, so he dies, in the
vanity of his mind. See him amidst distinguishing preservations, in
battles by sea or land, still preserved, while floating carcasses, or
opened graves, are all around him: do these things bring his heart to
God? Not in the least. The sum total of his character may be comprised
in a few words; "neither God is not in all his thoughts." Look at him in
the opposite side of the representation; let such an one be visited with
chastisements, in his own person sickness, in his family misery, in his
substance want; in short, in all that concerns him, a life of sorrow,
care, anxiety, disappointment, ruin. Perhaps to all these, a body long
the dwelling-place of some loathsome disease, under which he groans, and
at length dies, and dies the same unawakened sinner as he had lived. And
suppose these accumulated evils had been distinguished also with some
more peculiar maladies, in perils in the sea, in perils in the war, in
perils among men; nay, let him be maimed in his limbs, let him be
rotting in a prison, let him be worn out with misery from evil upon
evil, tike waves of the sea following each other; yet still he continues
the hardened, unsubdued sinner under all, and as unconscious of God's
rods as the prosperous sinner before described is of God's blessings.
Are these things so, my soul, and hast thou seen them? Yes, in
numberless instances. Oh then, learn, that without Jesus thou canst do
nothing. Outward circumstances, unaccompanied with inward grace, leave
men just where they found them; and plain it is, that grace alone can
change the heart. Lord Jesus, let these loud and crying truths, day by
day lead my soul to thee! Be thou all in 'all, my hope, my guide, my
strength, my portion; for "without thee I can do nothing."</p>

19—Evening—Exodus 12:26, 27</h3>
<p>"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
what mean ye by this service? that ye shall say, it is the sacrifice of
the Lord's passover."—Exod. xii. 26, 27.</p>
<p>My soul! thou hast lately been at the table of the Lord, to celebrate
Christ as thy passover. If thy children ask of thee, as the Jewish
children were here supposed to ask of their fathers," What mean ye by
the Lord's supper?" wouldest thou not catch at the favoured opportunity
to inform them? yea, wouldest thou wait to be asked? Can there be a
duty, or a pleasure upon earth, like that of a tender father instructing
his household in the things, which accompany salvation? Can the
imagination figure to itself any sight equally lovely to that of a
parent, or a master of a family, encircled by his little ones, and
answering to their interesting questions; yea, anticipating their
inquiries, by speaking of Jesus, his person, his grace, his love, and
all the wonders of his work, in the accomplishment of our salvation?
And, indeed, these were among the precepts under the old testament
dispensation. "Ye shall lay up (said Moses) these my words in your
heart, and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that
they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your
children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
thou walkest by the way; when thou liest down, and when thou risest up,"
Deut. xi. 18, 19. And if the subject of redemption was so interesting
then, though but in type and figure, what ought it to be now, when
Jesus, the whole sum and substance of it, hath come and finished it by
his blood? My soul! what sayest thou to these things? Hast thou
children, a family, a household, a charge of souls about thee? And wilt
thou not, at thy return from the Lord's table, or from the Lord's house
to thine own, season thy conversation with speaking of Jesus? Wilt thou
not begin the sweet subject of redemption, by way of calling up their
inquiries, and exciting their attention? Wilt thou not tell them where
thou hast been, and what thou hast been to the table of Jesus for; what
thou hast seen there, and what thou hast felt, and known, and enjoyed of
the Lord's presence, in holy communion? Surely their minds, how young
soever, will long to know more and more of a service so truly
interesting; and they will be looking forward to the time of life when a
ripeness of understanding, under the awakening influence of the Holy
Ghost, may prepare them to join the Lord at his table also, that they,
with all the ransomed of the Lord, may celebrate the Lord's passover.
Methinks I hear the earnest question of such, like the Jewish children,
"What mean you by this service?" and that, when opened and explained,
followed up by a thousand more: hath Christ been your passover? Hath he
been with you at the feast? Hath he manifested himself to your soul"
otherwise than he doth to the world?" Have you seen" the goings of your
God and king in his sanctuary?" And hath Jesus made your heart" burn
within you, while talking with you by the way, and in making himself
known to you, in breaking of bread, and in prayer."</p>

<p>"Arise, and go down to the potter's house; and there I will cause
thee to hear my words."—Jer. xviii. 2.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord, with the first of the morning will I arise, and go down at
thy command, where, by the secret and silent whispers of thy divine
teaching, I may gather suitable instructions for interpreting all thy
dispensations, both in providence and grace, towards me. Mark, my soul,
the vessel marred in the hand of the potter. Alas, how hath our nature
been marred since it came out of the hand of our Almighty Potter! Will
the potter cast his vessel away? No, he will new make it. Oh thou
glorious Lord! methinks I hear thy words in this, for thou hast not
thrown us away, but hast new made us, and more blessedly made us in
Christ Jesus. My soul, art thou indeed thus new made, a vessel unto
honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use? Attend then to thy
proper character, and never lose sight of it. Refer every act of mercy
and favour in thy original creation, in thy new creation, when marred by
sin, and in all the appointments and dispensations, both in nature,
providence and grace, in which thou art placed, to the sovereign will
and pleasure of Jehovah, thine Almighty Potter. All the different forms,
and the different ends, for which the whole is appointed, result from
his sovereignty, in which the richest display of wisdom and of love is
shewn. "Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed it, why hast
thou made me thus?" Much less in any of the dispensations, either in
providence or grace, shall any say, why dost thou use me thus? Precious
Jesus, it is enough to be new made in thee; to be new formed in thy
blessed likeness; to be taken into thy service; and to be made a meet
vessel for the master's use in thy family. Thy church is as a great and
well-furnished house, where there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth. And if my Lord condescend to look
on me, to use me, nay, to bring me into his house and family, that I may
be always under his own gracious eye; how humble soever the place or
lowly the station, to belong to Jesus is the supreme honour of all his
saints. My soul, make frequent visits to the potter's house, and never
fail to go down there whenever any temptation from the enemy, or thine
own heart, causeth thee to forget thy creatureship, and the wonders of a
marred creature, being new made in Christ Jesus.</p>

Corinthians 5:7</h3>
<p>"Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us."—I Cor. v. 7.</p>
<p>Thou art not wearied, my soul, I hope, with the subject of thy last
evening's meditation; and if not, the subject itself of the passover is
so abundantly interesting, that it furnisheth endless matter for the
sweetest thought. Every thing in the Jewish passover was typical and
figurative of Jesus; and therefore, that we might not err on so
important a point, the Holy Ghost, by his servant the apostle, calls him
by this very name; "Christ, our passover," and adds, "was sacrificed for
us." A lamb of the first year, without blemish and without spot, was set
apart, in the Jewish church, for the observance of this service; and
Christ, the Lamb of God, who was "holy, harmless, undefiled, and
separate from sinners," was set apart, in the christian church, for the
redemption of his people, from all eternity. The lamb was slain, in the
Jewish church, and roasted with fire; and when Christ was slain on the
cross, in the christian church, the agonies of his soul were such as one
sustaining the fire of wrath against sin: he was made both sin and a
curse, that his people might be made "the righteousness of God in him."
The lamb, in the Jewish passover, was to be roasted whole, and not a
bone of him was to be broken; and one of the principal features of the
Lamb of God, in the christian passover, is, that we are to receive a
whole Christ for salvation, whose bones, when on the cross, as if to
prove the allusion of the type to him, by a divine providence, were not
broken. The blood of the lamb, in the Jewish passover, was to be
sprinkled on the lintels and posts of the houses of the Israelites, to
preserve the inhabitants from destruction; and in the christian
passover, it is not the blood shed only, but the blood applied, by
sprinkling on the sinner's conscience, that delivers him from the wrath
to come. Neither the bolts nor bars of the Israelites' houses, no, nor
all the prayers offered up within, became the least cause of their
safety; but the blood on the door. So, in like manner, it is neither the
prayers, nor repentance, no, nor faith, as an act of our own, that can
preserve from destruction: it is "the blood of Christ alone, that
"cleanseth from all sin." Oh! how blessed is it to see the great work of
redemption thus shadowed forth in the scriptures from the beginning, and
that the whole, and every part of the Jewish service referred to the
christian sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. "Christ, our passover, is
sacrificed for us." Oh! for grace to keep the feast at the Lord's table,
a feast upon that sacrifice, and to remember what the Holy Ghost saith:"
Christ being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of
this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us," Heb. ix. 11, 12.</p>

21—Morning—Psalm 92:12</h3>
<p>"The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree."—Ps. xcii:12.</p>
<p>It forms a beautiful illustration, which the Holy Ghost condescends
to give of a true believer's state, as it stands before God, in the
allusion not unfrequently made in scripture to that of the palm-tree.
The direct tendency of the palm-tree is upward: it lifts its head, in
defiance of all impediments, towards the clouds. Now a true believer in
Jesus is always looking upward, and directing all his pursuits after
Jesus. His person, blood and righteousness are the objects of his
desire. And as the palm-tree is said to flourish the more when trodden
upon and attempted to be crushed; so the believer most oppressed for
Jesus's sake, will flourish in the graces of the Spirit more abundantly.
How fruitful also is the palm-tree: and how much the people of God bring
forth fruit in their old age, when, after long experience, they have
found that in Jesus alone their fruit is found. How much the palm-tree
likes sunny places! How precious the Sun of Righteousness is to his
people! And as the branches of palm-trees are worn in tokens of victory,
so the church above are beheld with palms in their hands: and the church
below carry the palm of rejoicing, when, from the atoning blood and
righteousness of Jesus, they are made more than conquerors through him
that loved them. My soul, art thou flourishing like the palm-tree? Yes;
if so be thou art planted in Jesus, and watered from the streams of that
river which maketh glad the city of God. Yes, if directing all thy
views, all thy hopes, all thy desires to Jesus, thou art living in him,
acting faith upon him, making him the alpha and omega of hope here, and
happiness hereafter. Blessed Sun of Righteousness, shine with such warm,
life-giving, fruit-imparting beams of thy rich grace upon my soul, that
I may flourish indeed under thy divine influence, and shew that" the
Lord, who is my rock, is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness
in him."</p>

21—Evening—Job 19:25, 26, 27</h3>
<p>"I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin, worms destroy this
body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and
mine eyes shall behold, and not another."—Job xix. 25, 26, 27.</p>
<p>What sublimity is in these words! and what blessed glorious truths do
they contain! Here is Job's creed. My soul, see if it be thine. Job did
not say, that he had heard of a Redeemer, and that he hoped it was true,
and he gave credit to it; but he saith, he knoweth it. And observe who
this Redeemer is. Job calls him his Goel, his Kinsman-Redeemer. For the
light of redemption belonged to the nearest of kin, and he might redeem;
Levit. xxv. 95. We have lost our inheritance, forfeited our possession,
and are poor indeed, both in person and in substance. Now as Christ, by
virtue of his being our nearest of kin, is the one, the blessed one, the
only one to whom the right of redemption belongs, and ma)' redeem both
our persons and our mortgaged inheritance; so we find Christ hath done
both. Job therefore exults: "I know, (saith he) that my Kinsman, my
Redeemer liveth." Oh, how blessed the thought! how precious the
assurance! But we must not stop here. This Kinsman-Redeemer" will stand
at the latter day upon the earth." Yes, saith the scripture, Jehovah
hath given assurance to all men of this, "in that he hath raised him
from the dead," Acts xvii. 31. Neither is this all. Job's creed goes on.
"Though (saith he) this body of mine be destroyed by worms, yet in this
flesh shah I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall
behold for myself, and not another for me." Sweet thought! Jesus hath
secured the resurrection of his people, and, by his own, hath confirmed
theirs. As sure as he arose, so sure must they; for he is the first
fruits, and, by their union with him, they are the after harvest. As
Jesus arose perfectly and substantially the very same body that died on
the cross, so must their redeemed bodies arise the very same. The hand
that now writes, and the eye that now reads, if a part of Christ's
mystical body by regeneration, must be interested in his resurrection
also, and must arise not only precisely the same identical body, but
every member of that body must be the same; for this is essential to
identity. Were God to raise another body, it would make another person.
This might indeed be done by God's power; but then it would be a new
creation, and not a resurrection of the old body. I must be the who I am
now, and the same as I am now, as to identity, in order to constitute a
resurrection. "This corruptible (saith Paul) must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality." Pause, my soul, over these
sweet, but solemn truths, and say, are they blessed to thy meditation?
Dost thou feel a joy, an interest in them? Oh! the unspeakable felicity
of knowing that we have a Kinsman-Redeemer, and that he liveth, and that
we live in him? Precious, precious Jesus! though all nations die, Jesus
liveth; and because he liveth, I shall live also! Lie down, my soul,
this night, with this blessed assurance, saying, hallelujah! Amen.</p>

<p>"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with
him are called, and chosen, and faithful."—Rev. xvii. 14.</p>
<p>What an awful thing must sin, in its own nature be, which hath
introduced such evil into the whole creation of God, in its
consequences. One might have hoped, however, that the meek and gentle
Lamb of God would have been exempt from the daring rebellion, and that
sin would not have bid defiance and waged war against the peaceable, and
holy, and harmless Jesus! But so far is this from being the case, that,
in all probability, war first broke out in heaven against the person of
God's dear Son, as man's glorious Head and Mediator, even before the
deadly malignity manifested itself against God and his Christ upon
earth, in tempting the first man and his wife in the garden of Eden, to
rebel against God. Pause, my soul, over this scripture. Who are they
here described that make war with the Lamb? Nay, rather, who are they
not? All the powers of darkness, all the varieties of the earth, all the
inhabitants of hell, all that are under the influence of that evil
spirit, which now worketh in the children of disobedience. Under this
dreadful banner of open rebellion against heaven, every man by nature is
enlisted; and until an act of sovereign grace and power is past, that he
that is Lord of lords, and King of kings, overcomes and brings them
under his blessed dominion, all ranks and orders of men are found. My
soul, are the weapons of sin fallen out of thine hands? Art thou brought
under the conquest of Christ's grace? Hast thou bent the knee of willing
homage to the Lamb, who hath bought thee with his blood, and made thee
his by his grace? Read thy character, if so, in these sweet words: "And
they that are with the Lamb are called, and chosen, and faithful." Art
thou called with an holy calling? Art thou chosen, and fully convinced
of this, that had not Jesus first chosen thee, thou wouldest never have
chosen him? Art thou faithful, in seeking and desiring no other
salvation, convinced that there is salvation in no other? Take with
thee, then, my soul, these precious marks of thy high calling and
fellowship, and see that thou follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth.</p>

22—Evening—Exodus 16:1</h3>
<p>"The wilderness of sin."—Exod. xvi. 1.</p>
<p>My soul! thou art still in a wilderness state, not yet arrived home
to thy Father's house; and thou art frequently exercised with wilderness
dispensations. Perhaps, under the Spirit's teaching, an evening's
meditation on the wilderness of sin, where Israel sojourned, will be
profitable to thee. Let faith lead thee thither, and see what subjects
are there opened before thee. Was there ever an instance like Israel,
which was brought out with a high hand, and stretched out arm, from the
tyranny of Egypt? Did the sea open a path for them to march through; and
that memorable spot, which to them became the way of salvation, become
to their enemies that pursued them, the pit of destruction? Did the Lord
go before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and cover them from danger
by the pillar of fire by night? After such miracles, yea, in the moment
of receiving the same continuance of divine favour, while on their way
to Canaan, what was there in the people's passing through the wilderness
of sin, that should have discomposed their minds, or made them call in
question God's faithfulness, and his love? Thou knowest, my soul, what
the scripture hath recorded of the events of the wilderness to Israel.
Though their history furnisheth a continued series of the Lord's mercies
over them, yet, on their part, little else can be found but rebellion,
unthankfulness, and sin. Pause, and let the apostle's question have its
full weight upon thee. "What then? (saith he) are we better than they?
No, in no wise; for we have before proved, both Jews and Gentiles, that
they are all under sin." Was there ever an instance of grace like this,
my soul, so great, so distinguishing, so abounding, when the Lord found
thee in the Egypt of thy fallen nature, and when he brought thee out
with a sovereign hand? Did Jesus open to thee a new and living way
through his blood? And dost thou not know, that his cross, which is thy
glory, and thy salvation, will be the condemnation of all the enemies
who despise it? Is thy Lord leading thee, going before thee, and
following thee, in grace, and goodness, and mercy, all the days of thy
life, like the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of fire, to Israel, and
bringing thee by a "right way, to a city of habitation?" Are these among
the daily manifestations of thy Lord? And shall thy passage (for thou
knowest that it is but a passage) through the wilderness of sin, make
thee for a moment lose sight of Jesus? True, thou art exercised; and
thine exercises appear to thee so peculiarly distressing, as if no one
of God's people before had ever been so circumstanced. But in them thou
shouldest mark the wisdom, as well as the love of him that appoints
them. Didst thou trace Jesus in all, thou wouldest find a sanctified
blessing in all; and the issue of thy heaviest trials would then bring
in an exact proportion of the sweetest comforts. It is because they are
peculiar, that they are suited to thee. There are numberless things
which occur in the exercises of thy brethren, which to thee would be no
exercises at all. They feel them, and know their pressure, and the love
of Jesus in sending them, and the tenderness of Jesus in helping them
under them, and bringing them out of them: all these things thou seest
and knowest in others, and findest cause both to admire and to adore the
divine faithfulness in the dispensations. But in the study and
improvement of the exercises in thine own heart, which, of all others,
is the most important, here thou failest. And yet thou art convinced, in
a cool hour, when grace is alive, that if a synod of angels were to
arrange the circumstances of thy state, they could not order them with
the wisdom and love that they are now ordered with. Go then, my soul, go
by faith, frequently to the wilderness of sin. Look at Israel's history,
and look up for wisdom to gather suitable instruction. Behold Jesus in
every dispensation. Whatever tends to lead thee to him, must be blessed.
It is impossible that any trial, be it what it may, can be otherwise
than blessed, which opens to the view Jesus therein, and endears and
makes Jesus precious thereby. And, my soul! while I wish thee frequently
to go by solemn meditation to the wilderness of sin, let each renewed
visit remind thee that thou art getting through it. Like children at
school, every day brings on the festival which will take us home to our
Father's house. A few steps more, a few exercises more, and Jesus will
send his chariot for us; yea, he will come himself to fetch us; and we
shall take an everlasting farewell both of the wilderness of sin and
this world of sorrow together. "Haste, haste, my beloved, and be thou
like to a roe, or to a young hart, upon the mountain of spices!"</p>

23—Morning—Revelation 1:13</h3>
<p>"One like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the
foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle."—Rev. i. 13.</p>
<p>My soul, thou art going this morning to the throne of grace, art thou
not? Pause then, and behold Jesus as John saw him, for the church's joy,
in his priestly vestments; for remember he is still a priest upon his
throne, and by the oath of Jehovah, abideth a priest for ever. Nay, my
soul, be not afraid, draw nigh; hark, surely he calls. Methinks he
speaks to thee' Behold me! behold me! See, I am thine intercessor. For
this cause I wear these priestly garments; and as the high priest of old
represented me, I appear in them down to the foot, and the golden girdle
round and beneath the breast. What is thy cause? What blessings and
praises hast thou to offer for past grace? And what supplications for
present and future favours? Behold my vesture dipped in blood. Think of
the everlasting efficacy of my righteousness: and for whom should I make
intercession but for transgressors?' Fall down, my soul, with holy
reverence and godly fear. Jesus will do by thee as he did by John. He
will lay his right hand upon thee, and say, "Fear not." Oh precious,
precious Lord, thou art, indeed, he that was dead, and now livest for
evermore. Arid thou livest to see the fruits of thy great salvation
faithfully and fully applied to every one of thy redeemed. Thy
priesthood is for ever. Thy intercession unceasing. I do behold thee,
Lord, by faith, even now standing with the blood of the covenant in
thine hand, and presenting me, even me, poor, wretched, worthless me, as
one of the purchase of this blood. Do I not hear thy voice in those
soul-reviving words, "Father, keep through thine own name those whom
thou hast given me? Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given
me be with where I am?" Oh glorious, gracious, Almighty High Priest[
thou art, indeed, "a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec."
Oh ye trembling souls! ye who have any cause this day to bring before
the court of heaven, look unto Jesus, look within the veil, see Jesus
there; look steadily, though humbly, and behold his hands, his side;
Zion is still engraven on his palms. Nay, do we not see, may we not read
our very names, as the high priest bore the names of Israel on his
breast, while his hands are lifted up to bless! Yes, Jesus takes up our
cause, bears our persons, and all our concerns. And how shall either
fail, while he "is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God
by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession."</p>

23—Evening—Colossians 1:28</h3>
<p>"Perfect in Christ Jesus."—Coloss. i. 28.</p>
<p>Sweet thought! And where should perfection be found, but in Christ
Jesus! My soul! turn the subject over and over again; look at it in
every point of view; consider it as it relates to the life that now is,
and that which is to come; and where wilt thou find any perfection for
grace here, or glory hereafter, but in Christ Jesus? Oh! what
heart-aches would it have saved me, had I but learned this sweet lesson
when the Lord first took me into his school. Had I but thought aright
when the Lord passed by, and saw me in my blood, and bid me live, that a
creature so polluted, and so poor, could never recompense such fiches of
grace, it would have tended to hide pride from mine eyes. But I was
delighted with myself, and the supposed improvement I should make; all
my views were directed how to requite the Lord's goodness, and how to
shine above others in the attainments I should make in the divine life:
and according to my views then, it would have been no difficult matter
to have persuaded me (had the adulation been offered to the pride of my
vanity in a guarded manner) that, what from labours and services, in
attending ordinances, and prayers, and the like, I was hastening on to
perfection, and possessed a good stock of inherent holiness.—Precious
Jesus! I bless thee, in the moment of recollection, for thine
unspeakable mercy in breaking this snare of the enemy, and bringing me
humbly to thy feet! And now, Lord, I again and again, and for ever,
desire to praise thee for keeping me still at thy feet, in the same
humble frame, convinced "that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no
good thing!" Oh, Lord! how should a creature such as man, who would not
for a moment, did his salvation depend upon it, form one good thought,
or prevent a train of evil thoughts from rushing in upon his mind; how
should such an one ever be led to the presumptuous hope of finding
perfection in himself? Precious Jesus! be thou increasingly precious
from the increasing wants of my soul for thee. Give me, Lord, yet more
and more to see that every thing in me, and from me, must be, like
myself, but dung and dross. Accept, Lord, I beseech thee, both my person
and my poor offerings, and let both be sweetly sanctified and perfumed
with the incense of thy blood and righteousness! Be thou, Lord, my whole
and sole perfection for righteousness here below, and may I be found"
perfect in Christ Jesus" in a life of grace, that I may everlastingly
enjoy thee in a life of glory hereafter. Amen.</p>

24—Morning—Job 31:32</h3>
<p>"The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to
the traveller."—Job xxxi. 32.</p>
<p>Though Job was thus hospitable, yet we know that angels would have
lodged in the street, if Lot had not taken them in. Nay, the Lord of
angels, when he came a stranger upon earth, had not where to lay his
head. He came indeed "unto his own, but his own received him not." My
soul, pause! Hast thou done better by thy Lord? Nay, thou hast not. And
though thou knowest the precept the apostle had it in commission to tell
the church, "not to be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby,"
as in the instance of the patriarch, and others, "some have entertained
angels unawares;" yet, my soul, how long did the Lord of life and glory
stand without, knocking at the door of thine heart, by the ministry of
his word and ordinances, saying—open to me; yea, and would have stood to
this hour, had he not, by his own sovereign grace, put in his hand by
the hole of the door, and opened to himself. Oh thou blissful stranger,
didst thou indeed come from a far country, on this gracious, blessed
errand, to seek and save that which was lost; and didst thou find every
heart resolutely shut against thee? Didst thou, blessed Jesus, when
travelling in the greatness of thy strength, open to thyself an entrance
into the souls of thy people, by the sweet and constraining influences
of thy Holy Spirit? Do thou, then, Almighty Lord, throw open the street
doors of my heart for thy constant reception! Make them like the gates
of that blessed city which are never shut day nor night. And cause my
soul, like the prophet on the watch-tower, or Abraham in the tent door,
to be always on the look out for my Lord's approach, that I may invite
thee; yea, constrain thee to come in, and abide with me, and to make
thyself known unto me, by the heart-burning discourses of thy word, and
in breaking of bread and of prayer. Yes, yes, thou glorious Traveller!
who art perpetually on the visits of thy love, I do know thee, I do
sometimes catch a sweet glimpse of thee, and trace the footsteps of thy
grace, in thy word, in thy ordinances, and in the various ways by which
thy presence is discoverable. Indeed, indeed, thou heavenly Stranger,
thou shalt not lodge in the street; but I will take thee home to my
house, to my heart and soul; and thou shalt sup with me, and I with
thee, according to thine own most gracious promise, and I will cause
thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>

24—Evening—John 12:2</h3>
<p>"There they made him a supper."—John xii. 2.</p>
<p>We are very apt to suppose the blessedness of those hallowed seasons
in which the Lord Jesus ate and drank familiarly with his disciples, as
peculiarly given to the followers of our Lord in the days of his flesh.
And, no doubt, there was a precious savour which Jesus manifested upon
those occasions. He that laid aside his garments, and condescended to
wash his disciples' feet, may well be supposed to have said and shewn a
thousand gracious things in those seasons, which are not recorded. But,
my soul, depend upon it, if we make Jesus a supper, or if Jesus invites
us to his own, which is the same thing, there will be always a blessed
savour of his person, work, and righteousness, when his person is the
subject of discourse, and his work and righteousness the rich food of
the soul. Our ordinary meals would be truly sanctified, if the love, and
grace, and favour of the bountiful giver of them, became the chief
conversation at our table. But is it to be wondered at, if carnal
company mingle at our entertainments, that carnal discourse, and not
that which tendeth to edification, should follow? And if Jesus be thus
forbidden, how shall it otherwise be, but that every thing connected
with Jesus is banished? How often, my soul, hast thou been at such
tables, and in such society where thy master is not honoured; but where,
at thy departure, thou mightest with truth have taken up the
observation, and said, ' Alas! I have neither said ought which might
benefit another, nor heard ought to be benefited by myself?' Blessed
Lord, while I sit down at the refreshments of thy bounties, give me
always to recollect from whom they come; and while I eat of the fat, and
drink of the sweet, do thou, Lord, send portions to them for whom
nothing is prepared. And cause me and mine, at every supper, to make
thee a supper in a true spiritual enjoyment of thee. Oh! for thy
presence to be always in view, and the savour of thy name to be as
"ointment poured forth!" And do thou, Lord, by the sweet influences of
thy Spirit, direct our conversation to the use of edifying, that we may
talk of Jesus, while Jesus draweth nigh to us; and at every supper,
think of the supper of the Lord; and by faith, enjoy that
marriage-supper of the Lamb in heaven, at which we hope, ere long, to
sit down for ever!</p>

25—Morning—Psalm 32:7</h3>
<p>"Thou art my hiding-place.—Ps. xxxii. 7.</p>
<p>Yes, dearest Jesus, thou art indeed my hiding, place. In every point
of view, I desire grace so to behold thee. Surely, from everlasting, in
thee, and thy person and righteousness, were all thy redeemed hid in the
councils of peace and salvation. And is not every individual hid in thee
also, Oh thou glorious head of thy church; while in a state of unrenewed
nature, to be secured from death and the grave, and from the
unpardonable sin; and as one of the apostles terms it, "preserved in
Christ Jesus, and called." And when called, and quickened by grace,
what, but from having our lives hid with Christ in God, could keep alive
the incorruptible seed, or preserve unextinguished the immortal spark?
Whence is it, my soul, that the smoking flax, which Satan and thine own
remaining indwelling lusts strive to blow out, is not quenched; or the
bruised reed, which appears so continually falling, is not broken—but
because Jesus is thy security, through whom, and in whom thy languishing
graces revive as the corn, and grow as the vine? Oh what springs of
grace must there be forever flowing from Jesus, though hidden from
mortal view! Surely, Lord, thou art my hidingplace, and therefore, with
thy leave, I will consider thee as a strong tower, into which the
righteous runneth and is safe. Yes, both my person and life, both my
safety and happiness, both my present peace and everlasting joy, all,
all are in thee. Doth any then, ask thee, my soul, where dwellest thou?
Tell them, in Jesus, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of
the stairs, even in Christ himself and his justifying righteousness;
secret and hidden indeed from mere men of the world, but revealed from
faith to faith to all his redeemed; and into which, tell them thou hast
found shelter from the broken law of God, from the dreadful effects of
sin, from death, from hell, and all the powers of darkness. And all
these, and numberless other unknown blessings, because Christ is my
hiding-place, who hath both preserved me from trouble, and hath
compassed me about with songs of deliverance.</p>

25—Evening—Matthew 21:34</h3>
<p>"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to
the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."—Matt. xxi.
34.</p>
<p>The very lovely season of the year, and the fulness of fruits which
appear on all the productions of God's providence around, open to the
mind some of the most delightful meditations. My soul! sit down this
evening, and give scope to the subject; and see, while contemplating thy
Lord's bounties in nature, whether thy Lord himself will not lead thee
by the hand into the inner department of contemplating his yet greater
bounties in grace. Methinks every thing seems to have a voice, and
speaks of Jesus. By the fall, our poor ruined nature is entitled to
nothing from the earth, but thorns and briers; therefore the numberless
sweets of the divine mercy preach Jesus, and his cross. It is as if they
all said, 'Are we lovely to the eye, pleasant to the taste, and
healthful in the enjoyment; then are we so by Jesus's appointment, and
by Jesus's blessing.' My soul! there is more of him, than thy unthinking
heart is conscious of, in every blessing and favour around thee. Oh! for
grace to keep this always in remembrance, that from henceforth thou
mayest find a double enjoyment in all; first, in beholding Him, and then
his gift, be it what it may, as his, and which he giveth thee liberally
to enjoy. And there is still another blessedness in thus sitting down to
the contemplation and enjoyment of divine bounties; I mean, that the
soul not only beholds Jesus in all, and enjoys Jesus in all, but it
beholds Jesus as looking on, and rejoicing over his people, in their
sanctified rise of his bounties. How truly blessed is that scripture in
point; "Yea, I will rejoice over them, saith the Lord, to do them good,
and I will plant them in this land, assuredly with my whole heart, and
with my whole soul!" Jer. xxxii. 41. My soul, sweetly meditate on these
things; and when thou beholdest, as in the present time of the year,
every thing around furnishing the witness of God's love and
faithfulness, "in giving rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling
our hearts with food and gladness;" let all lead to Him. Jesus himself
is in all. It is he who gives all, crowns all, sanctifies and sweetens
all. And never did any husbandman among men, wait for the precious
fruits of the earth with equal diligence and delight, as Jesus, in
beholding the fruits of his own graces, which by his Holy Spirit he
first plants, and then calls forth into exercise upon his own person and
righteousness. Say, my soul, as the church did, and let this be thine
evening song to the same lovely and all-loving Saviour: "My beloved is
come down into his garden, (the church) to the beds of spices; to feed
in the gardens, and to gather lilies." Song vi. 2.</p>

26—Morning—Genesis 32:24</h3>
<p>"And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the
day."—Gen. xxxii. 24.</p>
<p>My soul, here is a lovely portion for the morning. For the morning,
did I say? Yea, both for night and morning, and, indeed, until the
everlasting morning break in upon thee, and all the shadows of the night
flee away. For are not all the seed of Jacob like their father,
wrestlers in the actings of faith, and the fervour of prayer, until they
come off, like him, prevailing Israels? And who was this man which
wrestled with the patriarch? Let scripture explain scripture, and give
the answer. By his strength, said the prophet Hosea, chap. xii. 3,
&amp;c. "he had power with God; yea, he had power over the angel, and
prevailed; he wept and made supplication unto him; he found him in
Bethel, and there he spake with us; even the Lord God of Hosts, the Lord
is his memorial." Here then light is thrown upon the subject. He that is
called a man in one scripture, is called an angel in this other. And
that we might not overlook nor forget the identity of his person as the
very man whose name was then secret, Judges xiii. 18. but hereafter to
be made known, and himself appear openly, the prophet was commissioned
to tell the church, that he that spoke with us, in the person of Jacob,
our father, was the same that found Jacob in Bethel, even the Lord God
of Hosts; for that was his memorial. Gen. xxviii. 10-19. And was it then
He, whose name is Wonderful, which wrestled with Jacob? And when the
poor patriarch was hard put to it, full of fears, doubts, and
distresses, on account of his brother Esau, and was stirring up himself
to take hold of God's strength, by way of strengthening himself against
Esau, did he that came to strengthen him, first take hold of him, and
seem to contend with him, until the breaking of the day? Oh then, my
soul, here learn a sweet and precious lesson against the hour of the
many contentions with the Esaus of thy warfare; for thou wrestlest not
only against flesh and blood, but "against principalities and powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places." See, my soul, where thy strength is—even in
Jesus. See what a blessed example of prevailing in prayer the Holy Ghost
hath here set before thee. Look to this God-man with whom Jacob
wrestled, and come off successful; and say with Job, "Will he plead
against me with his great strength? no; but be will put strength in me."
Job xxiii. 2-7. Fill thy mouth with arguments, as Job did. Tell Jesus of
thy wants, tell him of his riches, tell him of thy guilt, tell him of
his precious blood and righteousness, and tell him that thy misery, and
weakness, and unworthiness, renders thee a suitable sinner for so
gracious a Saviour to get glory by in saving. Go to him, my soul, with
these strong, these unanswerable pleas. Jesus will love to hear, and to
receive them. And while he wrestles with thee, do thou wrestle with him,
all the night, in which thou art contending with thy sins within, and
temptations without; with the errors of the infidel, and the crying sins
of the profane. And do as Jacob did, wrestle, plead, supplicate, cry,
and take hold of his strength, his blood, his righteousness, and God the
Father's covenant promises in him; and never give over, nor let him go,
until the day break, and he blesseth thee.</p>

26—Evening—Exodus 20:24</h3>
<p>"An altar of earth."—Exod. xx. 24.</p>
<p>Every thing, and every service, in the old testament dispensation, as
well as in the gospel church, points to Christ. Behold, my soul, in the
Lord's appointment of "an altar of earth," how jealous the Lord is of
his honour. If the altar dedicated to the Lord's service, be of earth,
or if it be of stone, there was not to be the least mixture. Nothing
hewn, nothing polished by man's art, or man's device; "for if," saith
Jehovah, "thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it." Behold,
how fully Jesus was preached here! There can be nothing offered to the
Lord for his acceptance, but what is the Lord's. Jesus is the Father's
gift to poor sinners; and when a poor sinner presents before the Father,
the Lord Jesus as his whole altar, sacrifice, and offering, he presents
to the Father what the Father first presented to him. If the sinner were
to join any thing of his own with this offering, this were to pollute
it. Sweet thought! my soul, cherish it in the warmest of thine
affections; carry it about with thee for thy daily exercise of faith
upon the person of Jesus, that nothing of thine may mingle with the pure
and perfect salvation, which is alone in him. And, depend upon it, thy
God and Father is more honoured, more glorified, and will be more
beloved, by such a perfect reliance upon Him in whom his soul
delighteth, than he would be by the greatest and most costly sacrifices
of thine own providing. The infinite and eternal worth and efficacy of
Jesus's blood and righteousness, is upon everlasting record. God is well
pleased with him, and his people in him; and a voice from heaven hath
proclaimed it to the earth. To offer any thing of our own, by way of
making it pleadable, is to pollute it; yea, it is to make it
questionable, as if we thought it not complete. And by thus doing, we
declare that our hearts are not thoroughly pleased with what Jehovah
hath declared himself well pleased, but are seeking to rest our souls,
not upon the altar, which is wholly the Lord's, but adding to it of our
own. Oh! for grace to make Jesus what the Father hath made him, the all
in all of man's salvation; and be ever ready to let him have all the
glory, who alone hath aecomplished it, "in believing the record that God
hath given of his dear Son."</p>

27—Morning—Proverbs 22:19</h3>
<p>"That thy trust may be in the Lord, I have made known to thee this
day, even to thee."—Prov. xxii. 19.</p>
<p>My soul, mark for thy morning meditation, what is here said. Observe,
in the first place, the general knowledge the Lord hath given of his
saving truth and mercies in Christ Jesus, and which becomes a sufficient
warrant and authority for all the world to believe in Christ, and to
accept of Christ, to the salvation of the soul. Christ in the word is
the Father's authority for every sinner to believe the record God hath
given of his Son; and the rejection of this command will be the
condemning sin to every one who despises this plan of salvation, because
he hath heard and then turned his back upon this love of God in Christ
Jesus the Lord. My soul, ponder over this view of the subject, and then
turn to another sweet and distinguishing property of God's revelation
which he makes by his blessed Spirit, in the particular apprehension of
it. And this is done in every heart that is made willing in the day of
God's power, when the same grace which reveals Christ in the word,
reveals Christ also in the heart, the hope of glory. Here the verse of
the morning is confirmed in what God saith, that in order to every child
of God putting his trust in the Lord, he hath made known to thee, even
to thee, this day. Observe, my soul, the personal application of the
divine truth. God, by his Spirit, makes it known to thee. It comes like
a letter sent down from heaven. Who is it for? Read the direction. It is
for thee, my soul. Thus faith takes home the contents to the heart, and
finding how exactly every thing in Jesus and his salvation suits his own
case and circumstances, he lives upon it, feeds upon it, takes it for
his portion, trusts in God for the truth of it, and rejoiceth evermore.
My soul, hast thou marked these distinct things? and dost thou know how
to distinguish rightly between general proclamations of mercy, and
special, personal enjoyments of it? Oh then, live up to the full
enjoyment of God's rich mercy in Christ; accept Christ, and use Christ,
daily, hourly, to the glory of Father, Son, and Spirit; as the
redemption by Christ was intended; and bless God more and more for his
unspeakable gift.</p>

<p>"Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as
the grape gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul
desired the first ripe fruit. The good man is perished out of the earth,
and there is none upright among men."—Micah vii. 1,2.</p>
<p>Is not this lamentation as suited to the present times, as when the
prophet delivered it? Were the interests of Zion ever at a lower ebb
than now? Did the waters of the sanctuary run less in a stream in any
period of the church than the present? Surely it is like the
in-gathering of the fruits of the earth at this season of the year; the
choicest are gone; the trees are unladen. It is only here and there, as
"the shaking of an olive-tree; two or three berries in the top of the
uppermost bough." Isa. xvii. 6. The Lord hath been calling home his
chosen. Death hath been housing the servants of the Lord. And even those
that remain, alas! are they not more like the gleanings, than like the
first ripe fruits. Who is there interested for Zion? Who layeth it to
heart, that she languisheth in all her borders? My soul! can a throne of
grace witness for thee, that many a petition thou art lodging there,
that "the Lord would do good in his pleasure unto Zion?" Is it known to
the great searcher of hearts, that thou preferrest "her prosperity above
thy chief joy?" Dost thou tell the king that thou lovest him, in loving
his people; and knowing the preciousness of thine own salvation, art
thou seeking by prayer, and by every means in thy power to form and
promote the salvation of others? Oh Lord! give me grace "for Zion's sake
never to hold my peace, nor for Jerusalem's sake to rest, till the
righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof
as a lamp that burneth!"</p>

28—Morning—Deuteronomy 32:11, 12</h3>
<p>"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; so
the Lord alone did lead them."—Deut. xxxii. 11, 12.</p>
<p>Here learn a lesson, to form some faint idea how the Lord is
unceasingly engaged in taking care of his people. If thy God condescends
to represent it by such a similitude, is it not both thy privilege and
thy duty to mark the several particulars of such grace and tenderness?
The eagle not only possesseth in common with other creatures, the
greatest affection for her young, but manifests a vast superiority over
every other of the winged tribe in her management of her brood. She
provides for them and protects them, as other birds of the air do; but
in educating them, and the method by which she shelters them from
danger, here is displayed such superior wisdom and power, as far exceeds
whatever we meet with in other creatures. "She stirreth up her nest:" by
which we may understand, she suffers not her young eagles to lay
sleeping, but calls them forth to life and exercise. She" fluttereth
over them," as if to show them how they are to use their wings, and fly.
And when she taketh them from the nest, this is not done like other
birds, who carry their young in their talons, and in their haste or
flight may drop them—or when pursued, or fired at by an enemy, may have
them killed and herself not hurt; but the eagle beareth her young on her
wings, so that no arrow from beneath can touch the young, until it hath
first pierced through the heart of the old bird. What a sweet thought do
these views afford; and what a blessed instruction do they bring! My
soul, do they not teach thee, since the similitude is the Lord's own,
that he that hath stirred up the nest of thine old nature, in which thou
wast born, because he would not suffer thee to sleep there for ever in
the unawakened state of sin, and hath brought thee out, and brought thee
abroad, and taught thee how to fly up, in devout aspirations after him,
is the Lord? Is it not he that fed thee and sustained thee from thy
youth, even until now; taught thee, and hovered over thee, and caused
thee to" mount up as upon the wings of eagles; to run and not be weary;
to walk, and not faint?" Yes, yes, blessed Jesus, it is thou that hast
indeed borne me, as thou hast said, upon eagles' wings, and brought me
to thyself: so that I see, by this delightful comparison, that thou wilt
not suffer any of thy little ones to perish; for "he that toucheth them,
toucheth the apple of thine eye;"—nay, while on thy wings, he that
destroyeth them, must first destroy thee. Oh Lord, give me grace rightly
to enjoy and use such marvellous blessings. And since, to the wisdom and
strength of the eagle, thou hast now added the tenderness and solicitude
of the hen, do thou, Lord, gather me under thy wings, and nourish me
with thy love and favour, that I may be thine for ever, and live here by
faith, as hereafter I hope to live with thee in glory.</p>

<p>"And Peter said unto him, Eneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee
whole."—Acts ix. 34.</p>
<p>My soul! look at this man, Eneas: consider his circumstances of
bodily sickness, and the long period of eight years, in which he had
been bed-ridden. And when thou hast duly pondered the subject, behold
the sovereignty of that all-powerful, all-prevailing name of Jesus
Christ, though pronounced only by a servant, and see the blessed effects
of it. And wilt thou, after such an instance, go lean under any
spiritual sickness? Shall it be said that Jesus Christ cannot make thee
whole? Surely, thou wouldest tremble at harbouring such a thought, even
for a moment! And if thou darest not think such hard things of Christ's
ability, why shouldest thou not equally shudder at supposing thy Lord's
want of inclination? Hast thou not found him gracious in times past? And
was that grace the result of thy desert? Was it not the pure effect of
his own free love? And ought not past experience to beget future hope?
Is not every believer's life, a life of trust and dependence? Go to him,
my soul, under every new ailment, as thou wert led to him at first.
"Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, and today, and for ever." Let
faith have her full exercise. "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole." Here
rest thy whole confidence. Never go to him in any attempts of thine own;
but by a direct act of faith upon his glorious person, power, grace, and
compassion; in his strength, and not thy feeling, rest wholly upon him,
and plead thy necessities and his glory: and, depend upon it, this plan,
which is of the Lord's own appointing, win bring comfort under all the
leanness with which thou art exercised. Remember his own most gracious
words: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give it to you. Hitherto have ye asked
nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
full," John xvi. 23, 24.</p>

29—Morning—Romans 12:5</h3>
<p>"We, being many, are one body in Christ."—Rom. xii. 5.</p>
<p>One of the most delightful of all thoughts, and which when fully
enjoyed under the influence of the Holy Ghost, gives an unspeakable
felicity in the heart, is that union and fellowship of Christ with his
church. Ponder it, my soul, this morning. All the members of Christ's
body are but one body. the apostle saith, in Christ; "and he is the head
over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him
that filleth all in all." I would never, if possible, lose sight of
this, because in the perfect conviction and assurance of it must be
found all our security and joy. And the way by which this blessed truth,
under divine teaching, will be kept alive in the soul, is this: I would
behold myself, what I am by nature and practice in Adam, and connect
with this view what I am by grace and faith in Christ. Now, as Adam was
the common head of all his seed in nature, equally so is Christ the
common head of all his seed in grace. Do I consider that, when Adam
sinned in the garden, I as one of his children, and then, as scripture
saith of Levi, in respect to his connection with Abraham, was in his
loins, part of himself, and consequently implicated and involved in all
the good or bad belonging to him? Then it will follow, that in Adam's
sin I sinned, and in Adam's condemnation I was included. So then, as
Adam did not transgress only for himself, but for all his seed, by
nature, that should come from him; equally so when Christ fulfilled all
righteousness, and when Christ expiated all sin by the sacrifice of
himself, his seed were considered righteous in him; and his expiatory
sacrifice, as the head of his people, must be, to all intents and
purposes, the same as if they had been sacrificed with him. Cherish this
thought, my soul, and never allow thyself to behold Christ as the Christ
of God, in the capacity of a private or single person, but as the
covenant Head, the Father's Chosen, the Sent, the Sealed, the Anointed
of God, in whom all his members are one body in Christ. See that thou
hast the Spirit of Christ, by which thou art proved to be one of his.
And for the full enjoyment of all the blessings contained in this union
and communion with thy glorious head, daily and hourly remind God thy
Father of all his covenant promises made to Christ as the head of his
church and people, in which the Lord hath said," I will pour my Spirit
upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring."</p>

29—Evening—Psalm 52:8</h3>
<p>"But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God."—Ps. lii.
8.</p>
<p>My soul! canst thou humbly take up this language? See, and mark the
particulars, one by one. and then determine the important point. Here
the church at large is represented as a green olive-tree: and, by a just
conclusion, every member is a part; for," we, being many, are one body
in Christ." Now the apostle saith, that by nature this was not the case,
for we were of the wild olive-tree, and were grafted, contrary to
nature, into the good olive-tree; Rom. xi. 24. Hence, if thou art taken
from nature to grace, it must have been by conversion. The work is not
of man, but of God. And, so far is any man from contributing to it, that
it is altogether contrary to nature. Hast thou felt the cutting work of
conviction, when taken from the old stock of nature; and the healing
work of conversion, when brought into the new stock of grace, by an
union with Christ? And, when there is an union formed on the new stock,
there will be a communication from the root to the brauch. "He that is
joined to the Lord is one spirit." There will be a most blessed union; a
oneness, an interest, a life-giving, a life-strengthening principle,
communicated continually from Christ to his members. For he saith
himself, "Because I live, ye shall live also." Hast thou, my soul, these
blessed testimonies? Moreover, where there is this union with Christ,
and soul-communications from Christ, there will be not only life but
fruitfulness; a perpetual verdure, a state of constant flourishing. Say,
is it so with thee? Canst thou take up the language of this sweet
scripture, and say, "But I am like a green olive. tree in the house of
God?"—It is blessed so to be enabled to say; and blessed to ascribe all
the glory to the one only source, even Jesus; and blessed to mark the
distinguishing grace of the Lord in the appointment. For when the Lord
Jesus took thee from among the olive-trees, which were all wild by
nature, there were many there in the wilderness, apparently more
promising, and surely none more undeserving! And yet, while others were
left, thou wast taken. "Lord! (may I web and constantly cry out) how is
it that thou hast manifested thyself unto me, and not unto the world?"
Precious, bountiful Lord! fulfil in my soul that sweet promise; and
cause "my branches to spread, and my beauty in thee to be as the
olive-tree, and my smell as Lebanon," Hosea xiv. 6.</p>

Corinthians 12:9</h3>
<p>"My grace is sufficient for thee."—2 Cor. xii. 9.</p>
<p>My soul, gather a rich cluster this morning of those precious fruits
which hang upon the tree of life—even upon Jesus. Thou wilt find their
taste more sweet and pleasant than all the branches of the vine.
Consider the fulness in thy Lord. Such a fulness indeed, by virtue of
the covenant engagements in Jehovah, is treasured up in Christ, that all
the grace every individual of his seed could possibly want in time, and
all the glory hereafter—all, all is lodged in him. What a thought is
here! Consider also the freeness of this grace. Never, surely, did God
give any gift more free than when he gave his Son. And as the apostle
from hence justly reasons: "He that spared not his own Son, but
delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give
us all things?" When, my soul, thou hast feasted thyself upon the
fulness and freeness of the fruits of Jesus's salvation, gather another
rich portion for thyself with the hand of faith, in the suitableness and
sufficiency there is in him for thee. Take the sweet words spoken here
to Paul, but not limited to Paul, as if personally addressed to thyself.
It is Jesus now speaks and saith this day, "My grace is sufficient for
thee." This is as if he had said, all the grace I have is for my people;
and I have not only enough for all, but for every one; and I have it for
thee. I have the very portion which I knew each would want every day,
and all the day, through the whole of their pilgrimage state: from
everlasting I knew their need; and from everlasting I have laid every
individual child's portion by, and do keep it for him to the moment
required: and each shall find a suited sufficiency exactly answering to
all their wants, and corresponding to all their necessities. Precious
thought! Henceforth, my soul, cast all thy care upon Jesus; for thou now
seest how he careth for thee. Morning by morning hear his voice,
speaking personally to thyself," My grace is sufficient for thee."</p>

<p>"Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"—Ruth ii. 10.</p>
<p>My soul! dost thou not find continual causes for sending forth the
same inquiry as this poor Moabitess did, when thou art receiving some
renewed instance of Jesus's favour? Her heart was overwhelmed with the
kindness of Boaz, in permitting her to glean only in his fields, and to
eat a morsel of food with his servants: but thy Boaz, thy
Kinsman-Redeemer, hath opened to thee all his stores of grace and mercy;
he bids thee come and take of the water of life freely; yea, he is to
thee, himself, the bread of life, and the water of life; and is now, and
will be for ever, thy portion, on which thou mayest feed to all
eternity. When thou lookest back, and tracest the subject of his love
from the beginning, in the springs and autumns of his grace; when thou
takest a review of the distinguishing nature of these acts of grace;
when thou bringest into the account thine ingratitude, under all the
sunshine of his love and favour; will not the question again and again
arise, at every review, "Why have 1 found grace in thine eyes, that thou
shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? Stranger indeed,
by nature and by practice; living without God, and without Christ in the
world. And, my soul, it might have been, long since, supposed, that,
after such repeated unceasing acts of grace, as Jesus hath shewn, and
even when thou hast caused him "to serve with thy sins, and wearied him
with thy transgressions;" yet his compassions have failed not, but have
been "new every morning;" it might have been supposed, that long and
unceasing grace would at length have produced the blessed effect of
living wholly to him, who hath so loved thee, as to give himself for
thee. But, alas! the day that marks again his mercy, marks again thy
rebellion. So that the heart is constrained every day to cry out, "Why
have I found grace in thine eyes?" Precious Jesus! the only answer is,
because thou art, thou wilt be Jesus. Lord! I bow down to the dust of
the earth, in token of my vileness, and thy unspeakable glory! It is
indeed the glorious attribute of thy grace to poor fallen men: "the Lord
delighteth in mercy. He will perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy
to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of
old."</p>

<p>"Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?"—Isa. xxi.
11.</p>
<p>While this solemn inquiry may be supposed to have peculiar reference,
as addressed to the servants of the Lord, whom he hath set as watchmen
upon the walls of Zion, may it not be made personally to every man's
bosom also, as it refers to himself? And the repeating of it twice
should seem to imply the importance and earnestness with which it should
be followed up. My soul, what is the night with thee? Art thou watching
in it more than they that watch for the morning: yea, I say, more than
they which watch for the morning? How art thou exercising this
watchfulness? Is all safe respecting thine everlasting welfare? Art thou
watching the approaches of the enemy? Art thou watchful in prayer;
watchful for the gracious moment of the Spirit's helping thee in prayer;
watchful in guiding thee in the exercise of it; watchful of the Lord's
gracious answers to prayer; and, like the prophet on the watch tower,
having given in thy petition to the heavenly court, into the hands of
thy High Priest and Intercessor, art thou waiting to see what the Lord
will say unto thee? Lord, make me eminently watchful in these things. Go
on, my soul, in this heart-searching inquiry. Art thou waiting and
watching thy Lord's return? What of the night is it now? May not Jesus
come at even, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning?
Pause, my soul. Suppose his chariot wheels were at the door, wouldest
thou arise with holy joy, crying out, It is the voice of my beloved,
saying, "Behold I come quickly?" And wouldest thou answer, "Even so
come, Lord Jesus?" Oh for grace to be of that happy number, of whom the
Lord himself saith, "Blessed are those servants whom, at his coming, he
shall find so doing."</p>

31—Evening—Psalm 97:11</h3>
<p>"Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart."—Ps. xcvii. 11.</p>
<p>My soul! mark how blessedly the Holy Ghost speaks of the stores in
Jesus laid up for his people. Light, in which is included all blessings
in Christ Jesus, is sown, not reaped. This is not the harvest, but the
seed-time of a believer. It is a life of faith, a life of trust, a life
of dependence. Hence the apostle saith: "Let us not be weary in well
doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not;" Gal. vi. 9.
Now this light is sown for the righteous; for the true believer in the
righteousness of Jesus; and there shall be gladness in thee, and for
truly regenerated in heart. My soul! it were exceedingly to be desired,
that thou wouldest seek grace from the Holy Ghost to have a right
apprehension of the promises. It is to the want of this, very
frequently, that thy comforts are broken, and that thou walkest in
darkness. Thy Lord Jesus doth indeed give thee many sweet love-tokens by
the way, and handeth to thee many a blessed morsel of his bread in
secret, to comfort thee on thy pilgrimage; but it never was his design,
neither would it suit thy present state, nor his glory, to make the
wilderness any other than a wilderness. The Lord forbid that ought
should arise, to prompt thee to set up thy rest, like the Reubenites, on
this side the land of promise. No. Light is sown: mark that: and the
harvest is sure: here rest in full assurance of hope. Thy Jesus is
thine: thy interest in him is not now to be called in question: let him
then guide the way. And though clouds and darkness may rest upon it, yet
he is bringing thee by a right way to a city of habitation. This is the
minority of thine existence; and by and by thou wilt come of age. Thou
and thy companions are all going home to thy Father's house, to thy
Jesus, and his kingdom: and what will it signify, when thou gettest
there, what accommodation thou hast had by the way? Nay, the poorer it
hath been, the sweeter will be the refreshments that follow. And if thou
art but little acquainted with the luxuries on which the carnal rejoice,
the good things of the earth brought forth by the sun, and the precious
things put forth by the moon; yet having "the good will of him that
dwelt in the bush," thou hast a Benjamin's portion, and art most blessed
indeed. Say then, as the Psalmist: "From men which are thy hand, O Lord,
from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
bellies are filled with thy hid treasure! But light is sown for the
righteous and gladness for the upright in heart. As for me, I will
behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake with
thy likened."</p>

<p>"In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness
shall they be exalted."—Ps. lxxxix. 16.</p>
<p>See, my soul, what a blessed cause is again before thee to begin the
month, and to carry it on through every day, and all the day, and in
every part of the day, for joy in the name and righteousness of Jesus.
And mark it with peculiar emphasis, that it is Jesus, as Jesus, the
Christ of God, and his righteousness as the righteousness of God, in
which all thy rejoicing is, and not in the finest frames, or spiritual
exercises of thine own. A daily sense of a need of Christ, and as
constant a sense of acting faith upon Christ; these form the foundation
of every true believer's joy, and make the savour of Christ's name like
ointment poured forth; And whence is it, my soul, that all the redeemed
are said to rejoice in the name of the Lord all the day, but because the
Lord hath saved them and redeemed them for his name's sake? And whence
is it said, that in his righteousness they shall be exalted, but because
from their union with Christ, as their spiritual head, they are accepted
in his righteousness, and are made the righteousness of God in him?
Here's an exaltation indeed, enough to make the heart of the most
sorrowful glad, let outward circumstances be what they may; when inward
joy and peace in believing give such a blessedness to the believer's
view of the name of Jesus. See to it then, my soul, that all thy fresh
springs of joy are in him. Be very jealous over thyself, in the happiest
moments of thy comfort, that Christ's name, and his righteousness and
salvation, lie at the bottom of thy joy. Where is Jesus? I would ask my
heart, when I am most at ease and happy. Is he in this happiness? And is
this happiness enjoyed, and enjoyed purely, because Christ is in it?
Trace this, my soul, through all the parts of salvation, and through all
thy paths in grace, and see whether thou art bottoming every hope and
every mercy, both for time and eternity, in the name and righteousness
of Jesus only: for, depend upon it, as Jehovah hath said, in the
pardoning and blotting out the transgressions of his people," I, even I,
am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my name's sake;" so it is
to the everlasting praise of his name, that all the glory of salvation
is, and must be ascribed. Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's
sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>

<p>"An anchor of the soul."—Heb. vi. 19.</p>
<p>In the opening of a new month, look, my soul, at thine anchor! Surely
it is good and profitable for thee to see thy safety, that thou mayest
ride out all the storms which arise, and never make "shipwreck of faith
and a good conscience." And what is thine anchor? Nay, who, or what can
it be, but Jesus, and his finished righteousness? He hath accomplished
redemption by his blood, and hath entered within the veil to prove its
all-sufficiency. On him, then, thou hast cast anchor; indeed, he is
himself the anchor of all thine hopes, and the rock of ages, on which
thou restest thine eternal security, "both sure and stedfast." True, it
is unseen; and, like the sailor's anchor, thrown out into the deep. But,
though unseen, it is not unenjoyed: for concerning him, who is the
anchor of the soul, it is the blessed privilege of faith to say, "whom
having not seen, we love: and in whom, though now we see him not, yet
believing, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving
the end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls." But the anchor
of this world's mariner, and that of the spiritual navigator, differ
most widely. His anchor is thrown forth at an uncertainty: it may break;
it may find no anchorage; the cable may give way; the ship may drive;
and one anchor after another be lost, and the vessel, after all,
founder. Not so with him, whose hope and anchor of the soul is the Lord
Jesus: "He is a rock; his work is perfect." His salvation is founded in
the everlasting counsel, purpose, will, and good pleasure, of God our
Father; it is secured in the perfect obedience, righteousness,
blood-shedding, and death of our Lord Jesus Christ: and the soul who
rests on this anchor of hope alone for redemption, bath been brought
savingly acquainted with the Father's love and the Son's grace, through
the blessed teaching, power, and application of God the Holy Ghost. My
soul! is this thine anchor? Hast thou this glorious security, entered
within the veil for thee; unseen, indeed, but not unknown; undeserved,
but not unenjoyed? Oh! what unspeakable mercies are unceasingly arising
out of this divine, this rapturous hope, to support my weather-beaten
soul! Surely, precious Jesus! I may well look up to thee, in the opening
and close of every day, and every month, as the anchor of my soul, both
sure and stedfast: for thou hast been to me, and thou wilt still be,
until I get into the haven of everlasting rest, what thou hast been to
all thy redeemed; "a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in
his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the
blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall;" Isa. xxv.

<p>"My Father is the husbandman."—John xv. 1.</p>
<p>Blessed truth, and blessed assurance, to the true followers of Jesus.
Yes, Almighty Father! I would pray for thy continual teaching, to behold
thee as the husbandman of thy vineyard, the church, in which thou hast
raised up the Plant of Renown, the Man whose name is the Branch, the
true Vine, in whom, and upon whom, and through whom, all thy redeemed,
taken from the olive-tree that is wild by nature, are grafted, and bring
forth fruit unto God. Yes, Almighty Father! I would desire grace to
behold thee, and while I behold, to love, to praise, to adore thee, that
from everlasting thou hast graciously been the husbandman of thy church.
It was in thee, and from thee, as the contriver and appointer of all
that concerned redemption, we trace the fountain and source of all that
grace, mercy, peace, and favour here, with all the unknown treasures of
glory hereafter, which thou hast placed in his most blessed hands, who
is the Lord our righteousness. In every renewed view of Jesus, as the
true Vine, which thou hast planted; and in every renewed communication
from his fulness, nourishment, and life-imparting influences; may it be
my happy portion, Oh Lord, to eye thee, as the husbandman, while I feel
and know my union in Jesus as the Vine. And do thou, most gracious God
and Father, condescend to act the part of the kind husbandman still. Let
thine eyes be upon me for good, as the husbandman visits his vineyard.
Water, Lord, with the heavenly dew of thy word and Spirit, the dry and
languishing plantation. Oh that the Lord may give showers of blessing,
and that he may be to me as the latter, and as the former rain, upon the
barrenness of my heart. Preserve me, Lord, from the wild boar of the
wood, even Satan, that he may never tread me down. Weed out, Lord, the
briers and thorns, even the corruptions of my own heart, which would
twine themselves with the tender branches. And lop off, Oh Lord, all the
superfluous shoots, even the world's enticements, which might prevent
fruitfulness in Jesus. In all things, blessed God and Father, be thou
the kind, the tender, the wise husbandman, in doing for me what thou
seest to be needful, however painful to flesh and blood the pruning
dispensations and wintry providences may be found. Do thou purge, as
Jesus hath said, every branch that beareth fruit, that it may bring
forth more fruit; and by thy gracious Spirit so cause me to abide in
Christ, and that Christ may abide in me, that thou, my God and Father,
mayest be glorified in my bearing much fruit, to the praise of thy
grace, wherein thou hast made me accepted in the beloved.</p>

<p>"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top
of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God ascending and
descending on it."—Gen. xxviii. 12.</p>
<p>Visions of the night, such as the patriarchs were blessed with, serve
to teach us how the Lord, in those early ages, watched over his people.
And, my soul, I would have thee always take the sweet conclusion from
the review of them, that if Jesus was thus mindful of his chosen then,
depend upon it he is not less attentive now. There can be no difficulty,
it should seem, interpreting this vision of the patriarch Jacob's
ladder, after what Jesus told Nathaniel of the ascent and descent of the
angels upon the Son of man, John i. 51. Under such an authority, we need
not hesitate to consider Christ as the only communication, the only
medium of intercourse between heaven and earth; John xiv. 6. And if the
patriarch saw, in a vision, a ladder, with its foot on the earth, and
its top reaching to heaven, thus uniting both; were not these
representations of Jesus, as Emmanuel, his human nature and his divine:
thus uniting such vast extremes, and forming in both, one glorious
Mediator, to bring sinners to God, and bring down grace upon the earth?
And as Jehovah stood above it, in the patriarch's view, what was this
but to shew the authority of Christ, as the Christ of God? Precious
addition to the vision indeed, for this is the warrant of faith in
believing "the record that God hath given of his Son. God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto himself." Blessed Emmanuel] I hail thy
glorious person! I bow down to the earth in humble adoration, love, and
praise! I view thee, O Lord, as the only mediation for my precious soul;
and desire to renounce every other! Witness for me, ye angels of light,
who minister to the heirs of salvation, that, on my bended knees, in
transports of rejoicing, I bless God for having opened such a new and
living way for poor sinners; and very humbly and earnestly do I beg of
him, that my God will unceasingly make sweet communications of grace by
Jesus, and call forth the suitable returns, in love, and praise and
obedience, through Jesus, in my soul, until faith is swallowed up in
absolute enjoyment, and that blessed hour, which Jesus promised, be
fulfilled, when I shall see heaven open, and" the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</p>

<p>"Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy
son, thine only son from me."—Gen. xxii. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder these words. By whom were they spoken? It is said by
the angel of the Lord; probably the messenger of the covenant; he, who
in the fulness of time, was to make known, face to face, to all
Abraham's seed, the whole revelation of Jehovah concerning redemption.
It was a critical moment in Abraham's life, and a trying moment to his
faith. It is said, "Now I know." Did not the Lord know before? Oh yes;
but he that gave Abraham the faith, now afforded an opportunity for the
exercise of it. My soul, how blessed is it to remark, that the largest
gifts of grace are dispensed, when there is the largest occasion for
them. "As thy days, so shall thy strength be." And, my soul, do not
forget to remark also, that our Isaacs, our children, our earthly
comforts, are most likely to be continued to us, when the Lord gives
grace and faith to be most ready at his holy will to part with them.
When I can say, Lord, all that thou hast given me is thine; and if thou
art pleased to take all, or any part back again, still it is thine
own—not mine, but lent. Oh, for grace, like Abraham, to bless a taking
God, as well as a giving God, and to withhold nothing from him. Pause,
my soul, one moment longer over this precious portion. Is there nothing
more to be gathered from it? Look again; read it over once more. Pass
beyond Abraham, and contemplate the God of Abraham, and see if thou
canst not discover the infinite, unequalled, astonishing love of God the
Father typified in this solemn transaction; and while we behold Abraham,
at the call of God, giving up his son, his only son; may we not behold
God, uncalled, unsought, and without any one cause but his own free
everlasting love, giving up his only begotten Son, as a sacrifice for
the redemption of his people? The patriarch gave up his son but in
intention; but God in reality. And, my soul, what oughtest thou now to
say to God in the view of this transaction? Methinks I find authority,
from these sweet words, to make a paraphrase upon them, and to make
application of them, for all and every circumstance with which I may be
exercised; and, looking up to God my Father in Christ Jesus, I would
say, 'Now, O Lord and Father, I know thou dost love a poor, sinful,
unworthy worm as I am, seeing thou hast not withheld thy Son, thine only
Son from me.'</p>

<p>"A ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes."—Acts xxiv. 5</p>
<p>My soul! hast thou arrived at that station of dignity, to be
reproached for Christ's sake? If so, thou wilt enter into a proper sense
and enjoyment of the title Paul was branded with; a ringleader, or a
standardbearer of the cross. One who, not content with receiving Christ
into his own heart, determines, let the cost be what it may, the loss of
reputation or of life, to proclaim Jesus upon the house-top. This is to
be a ring-leader! An honourable station! and one that Jesus loves! Jesus
himself was Jehovah's ringleader, for he saith, "In that day, there shah
be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it
shall the gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious." Isa. xi. 10.
And elsewhere, Jehovah saith, "Behold, I have given him for a witness to
the people, a leader and commander to the people." Isa. Iv. 4. My soul,
hast thou taken part in the reproaches of God's choicest servants? It is
impossible to be a true follower of the despised Nazarene, unless thou
hast followed him "without the camp, bearing his reproach." The world,
from the days of Cain, in his persecution of Abel, hath, in all ages,
branded the ringleaders of the Lord's cause. The servants were treated
as the master. His prophets, "troublers of the land," Amos vii. 10. His
city, always "a rebellious city," Ezra iv. 15. Yea, Jesus himself, as
"one perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,"
Luke xxiii. 2. Precious Lord! could not thy meek, harmless, and
inoffensive conduct pass on without this censure; then who can hope to
escape? I know, Lord, that to hold thee up, and proclaim thee as
Jehovah's ensign to the nation, is to be indeed a ringleader of the
cross, against which all hell must wage war, and all the powers of this
world's customs will declare enmity. But be thou my standard, and I
shall be more than conqueror, through thy grace helping me. Oh! let me
unceasingly speak thy praise, and let the fathers to the children make
known thy truth.</p>

<p>"And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city
of habitation."—Ps. cvii. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, what are thy daily exercises concerning the way the Lord thy
God is leading thee through a wilderness dispensation? Art thou
convinced that it is the right way? What if it be a thorny way, a
tempted way, frequently a dark way; yet art thou satisfied that it is
the right way, because it is thorny, tempted, dark, and with numberless
other exercises. This is the plan to judge by. And though, my soul, I
trust thou hast grace enough given thee to see and know, in thy cool
hours of thought, that whatever thy God appoints must be right, and his
holy will must be done; yet there is an exercise of grace which goes
much beyond these views of the subject, and which a believer is enabled
to bring into practice, when he not only submits to a painful
dispensation, but rejoiceth in it, because it is the right way. When he
saith, I am afflicted; but afflictions are useful. I am in dark and
trying circumstances; but these also are useful. I am buffeted by Satan;
but this also I find to be right, because Christ is the more endeared
thereby, and his strength is perfected in my weakness. My God is
bringing me by a right way, to a city of habitation. Of this I am sure.
And every step leading to the final attainment, is already marked by
infinite wisdom, and provided for by infinite love; and Jesus himself is
with me through all the pilgrimage. Hence then, I conclude, that if at
any time I am at a loss to see my way, to find comfort in my way, or if
I am obstructed in my way, still it is the right way, because Jesus
himself is the way, and his unerring wisdom is in the appointment. Oh
for grace in lively exercise, to be as satisfied now of all the
despensations concerning the church and people, as when of old, in the
wilderness! The Lord is leading forth by a right way, to bring to a city
of habitation, whose builder and maker is God.</p>

4—Evening—Psalm 130:4</h3>
<p>"But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared."—Ps.
cxxx. 4.</p>
<p>My soul, this is a golden psalm, and every portion of it more
ponderous in value than the choicest gold of Ophir; and this verse is as
the tried gold, to ascertain the purity and value of all the rest. The
cries of a truly broken heart, from the depth of sin to the depth of
divine mercy, with which the psalm opens, prove the work of the Holy
Ghost, imparting the words with which the humbled soul comes before the
Lord. And the blessed consolations which this verse contains, in the
view of the mercy-seat, and the mercy there (which is all-precious
Jesus, the first-born in the womb of mercy; yea, mercy itself) as
plainly prove the leadings of the Holy Ghost to him, who alone can say,
"Oh Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help!" Ponder,
my soul, these precious words: "But there is forgiveness with thee." Is
it not as if thou wert to say to thy God and Father, when under deep
searchings of heart by reason of conscious sin, There is Jesus with
thee; he is my propitiation; he is my propitiatory, the mercy-seat,
between the cherubim of glory; in whom, and from whom, thou hast
promised to speak to thy people! And shall I doubt thy pardoning love
and favour, as long as I behold Jesus with thee? Shall I for a moment
question my acceptance in the beloved, while I behold "the man at thy
right hand, even the Son of man, whom thou madest strong for thyself?"
Shall I fear coming to a God in Christ for pardon, so long as I am
interested in the forgive, ness that is with thee, in God the Son's
righteousness and atoning blood; and God the Father's covenant
engagements in him, got the display of the glory of his grace?' Oh, how
unanswerably strong, conclusive, and satisfactory, to a poor burdened
conscience, is this view of Jesus, the propitiatory; Jesus the
propitiation! But what is the meaning of the expression in the latter
part of the verse; "there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
feared?" Would not the verse read better if it were said, that thou
mayest be loved? Oh no; "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom." And although "perfect love casteth out fear," that is, the fear
of hell, the bondage fear of unpardoned sin; yet, the child-like fear,
which a sense of pardoning love begets in the soul, is among the
sweetest exercises of the renewed nature. Devils fear and tremble, and
feel despair and horror; but the affectionate fear of a dutiful child is
the reverse of this, and only manifests itself in the most earnest
desire never to offend. And the sense of God's forgiving love, and of
Jesus always on the propitiatory, becomes the great preservative from
sin. Hence the Lord himself saith, "I will put my fear in their hearts,
that they shall not depart from me," Jer. xxxii. 40. My soul, fold up
this sweet portion, and take it with thee to thy pillow, that it may lie
down with thee, and rest in thine heart; that Jesus, thy Jesus, thy
propitiation, is with Jehovah, that thou mayest fear him; and he may be
thy exceeding joy and confidence, both now and for ever. Amen.</p>

5—Morning—Zechariah 1:16</h3>
<p>"Therefore, thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with
mercies."—Zech. i. 16.</p>
<p>My soul, think what a sad state that land, that church, that family,
that heart is in, where God withdraws but for a moment! This will be one
way of rightly appreciating his presence. What a mercy, what an
unspeakable mercy is it when God returns! For until he returns in grace,
there will be no return to him in a way of seeking mercy. Pause, my
soul, over the thought. Though a child of God loseth not the interest
and favour of God in his covenant, because what unworthiness soever, as
in ourselves, we must appear in before God, yet in Christ there is an
everlasting worthiness, in which his people are accepted and beloved:
yet if the Lord suspends his gracious influences on the soul; if Jesus
speaks neither by Urim nor Thummim; if the Holy Ghost, though at home in
the heart, manifests not himself to the heart; what shall the soul do?
Ordinances are nothing if the God of ordinances be not in them. To look
inward, the soul finds no peace. To look upward, there can be no
comfort. For if the Lord commands the clouds to poor no rain upon his
inheritance, their heaven is as brass, and their earth as iron. Hast
thou, my soul, experienced trying seasons; and, though convinced of an
interest in Jesus, hast thou languished after the sweet and blessed
visits of his grace? Listen then to this precious scripture," I am
returned, saith the Lord unto Jerusalem with mercies." Welcome, Lord, to
my soul, to my heart! Thy presence is better than life itself. And the
mercies thou hast brought with thee, in pardoning, quickening, renewing,
reviving, comforting, strengthening me, will put more joy in my heart
than thousands of gold and silver. There will be no barren ordinances,
no barren hearts, no barren land, where our God comes. Thou hast said,"
I will be as the dew unto Israel." Oh what a revival in my poor heart;
what a revival will thy presence make in my family; what a revival in
thy churches; what a revival in this dear land of our nativity! Oh come,
Lord Jesus, come in our midst; and let us hear thee say," I am returned
to Jerusalem with mercies." "Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken,
neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate; but thou shalt be
called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah; for the Lord delighteth in thee,
and thy land shall be married."</p>

<p>"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me ill my throne,
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his
throne."—Rev. iii. 21.</p>
<p>My soul! let this evening's meditation be sacred, in contemplating
Jesus, even thy Jesus, sitting down on the throne of his Father, having
overcome all opposition, and triumphed by his cross, over death, sin,
and hell! And in this contemplation, be sure that thou behold Jesus in
thy nature; for it is in that nature the victory was obtained. The Son
of God, as God, had no throne to obtain by overcoming; neither could a
throne be given to him; for all things were his in common with the
Father and the Holy Ghost, in the one glorious essence of the Godhead,
from all eternity. So that it is in the human nature of Christ, these
triumphs are set forth; and as the glory-man Mediator, thou art called
upon to behold him, for his victories, and the merits of his
redemption-work, as sat down in the throne. Sweet thought! cherish it my
soul, as the first, and best, and most glorious of all thoughts! Thy
Jesus, in thy nature, is on his throne. And now, when with an eye of
faith thou art viewing him there, next bear the blessed and gracious
words which come from him, on his throne:" To him that overcometh will I
grant to sit with me." Blessed Lord! Is it possible, that my poor nature
can ever arrive to such unspeakable felicity? Can I venture to cherish
such a hope? What! shall this poor, feeble, trembling nature of mine,
encompassed as it is with sin and temptation, and in the midst of a
waste and howling wilderness; shall I one day sit down with my Lord, see
him as he is, and dwell with him for ever? Oh! for faith to believe, and
for grace in lively exercise, "to run with patience the race that is set
before me, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher, both of faith
and salvation!" And shall I not, dearest Lord, be continually gathering
new strength from thee? Will not Jesus, who hath taken my nature,
undertaken my cause, and engaged as my surety, both for grace and for
glory, be every thing I need, my light, and my life, my hope, and
strength, and salvation? Yes! thou gracious Lord! thou wilt make me more
than conqueror through thy grace upholding me; and, like the redeemed
now in glory, I shall overcome" by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
word of thy testimony;" and sit down with thee in thy throne, even as
thou hast overcome, and art sat down in thy Father's throne. Hallelujah.
Amen.</p>

6—Morning—Song of Solomon 8:6</h3>
<p>"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals
thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."—Song viii.
6.</p>
<p>My soul, is this the language of thine heart to Jesus? Yes, it is.
Can any desire to be nearer Christ than thee? Can any long more to be
worn as a signet upon his arm, and to lay nearer his heart than thee?
And can any desire more than thou dost, to be sealed with his Holy
Spirit unto the day of redemption? Surely, my soul, thou longest
earnestly for these precious things, that that arm of Jesus, on which
thou wouldest be set as a seal, may be ever clasping thee; and that
heart of thy Redeemer's upon which thou art engraven, as the high priest
bore the names of the people of Israel, may be always folding thee, and
hearing both thy person and thy wants before the throne, and thus
unceasing fellowship may abound with the Father and with his Son Jesus
Christ. And canst thou not say, as the church did to Jesus, "For love is
strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave?" For as death conquers
all, and the grave admits of no rival, so thy love to Jesus, which he
hath planted in thine heart hath conquered thee; and no rival, no
partner, can divide the throne of thine heart with Jesus? Every thing in
thee concerning Jesus, is as though on fire; and all the flames of thine
affection burn with this language," Whom have I in heaven but thee; and
there, is none upon earth I desire besides thee. My flesh and my heart
faileth; thou art the strength of my heart, and thou art my portion for
ever." But pause, my soul, is there not somewhat, in those precious
words of the morning, in which Jesus may be supposed to say the same to
thee? Surely, my soul, if thou forest him, it is because he first loved
thee! And if the real cry of thine heart is to be set as a seal upon his
heart, and upon his arm, depend upon it, it is because he hath been
before hand with thee in both. Precious Redeemer! and dost thou indeed
bid me set thee in my heart, and on my arm? Lord Jesus, I would wear
thee in my heart. I would never, never suffer thee to depart from my
arms. I would feel thee inward, manifest thee by every outward
testimony; and as seals upon the arm and upon the breast are in sight,
so would I set thee always before me, and tell the whole earth whose I
am, and whom I love; that whither thou goest I would go, and where thou
dwellest I would dwell: for I am no longer my own, but am bought with a
price; therefore I would glorify God in my body, and in my spirit, which
are his.</p>

6—Evening—Philippians 3:18, 19</h3>
<p>"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is
destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their
shame, who mind earthly things.)"—Phil. iii. 18, 19.</p>
<p>My soul! hast thou not felt somewhat of the affliction of the
apostle, in beholding how the great mass of carnal men live, and for the
most part die? Nay, who can look on and view it without tears? The
apostle hath enclosed the view within parenthesis, and it were to be
wished, that indeed it was no where to be found but in parenthesis. But,
alas! the truth is too striking, too palpable, and meets the
contemplative mind at too many entrances and passages through the world,
not to shew that it is far more general than is imagined. By our
apostacy from God, man, that was originally exalted above the whole
creation, is sunk below the whole: for no creature of God, among the
brutes that perish, ever arrived to such a proficiency in sensuality, as
to glory in that which constitutes our disgrace and shame! Brutes may
riot in gorging their corrupt passions: but it is the human brute alone
that glories in the reflection! Hence, of all the creatures of God,
none, by nature, can be more remote from God, devils excepted, than
fallen man! None, in whose minds Satan could find a seat to rule and
reign, but man! And while, by nature, thus exposed to perish, for any
act of our own by which we could do aught to prevent it; yea, without
even a desire to prevent it, or a knowledge of the awful depths of sin
into which we are fallen, in order to send forth a cry for recovery:
while thus living, and thus dying, at an everlasting distance from God,
at once the scorn of angels, and the willing slaves of the devil. As in
the delirium of a fever, so in the madness of the mind, the poor
creature that is under the dominion of it, is unconscious of the whole,
and glories in that which is his shame, and which melts every heart into
pity, but the heart of fiends and the powers of darkness! My soul! hast
thou duly considered these things? Dost thou behold, as Paul did, many
around thee, that thus walk? Dost thou remember when thou didst so walk?
Dost thou call to mind "the wormwood and the gall?" And canst thou ever
overlook, or forget, who it was that brought thee out? Canst thou cease
to remember when and where the Lord Jesus passed by, and took thee up in
his arms, when thou wast loathsome in thy person to every eye but his;
and when he, like the divine Samaritan to the wounded traveller, brought
thee to the inn of his church, when thou wast left more than half dead
by the enemy of souls? Oh! precious, precious Lord Jesus! the more I
contemplate thy glorious person, and thy gracious mercy to our poor
fallen nature, the more unceasingly lovely dost thou appear. There was
indeed, and is, "a love that passeth knowledge!" Oh! for grace to
reverence these bodies of ours, which thou hast redeemed; that while the
carnal glory in their shame, all the redeemed may cry out, with the holy
indignation of the apostle, and say, as he did, "God forbid that I
should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
world is crucified unto me and I unto the world," Gal. vi. 14.</p>

7—Morning—Proverbs 18:24</h3>
<p>"A friend that sticketh closer than a brother."—Prov. xviii. 24.</p>
<p>And who is this, my soul; indeed, who can it be, but Jesus? None
among the fallen race of Adam could ever redeem his brother; or, if he
could, would have done it, at the expence of his own soul. But Jesus did
all this, and more, when our cause was desperate, and gave himself a
ransom for his redeemed. Oh for grace to mark the features of his love.
It began in eternity, it runs through all time, and continues
everlasting. As Jesus is himself, so is he in his love; the same
yesterday, and to-day, and for ever. And how hath he shewn it? First, by
engaging as our Surety; then paying all our debts; fulfilling the whole
law; purchasing our persons; undertaking for our duty; nay, even to the
conquering the stubbornness of our nature, and making us willing to be
saved in the day of his power! And what is it now? Having accomplished
redemption for us by his blood, he is gone to take possession of a
kingdom in our name. There he still manifests "the friend that sticketh
closer than a brother;" for he takes up all our causes, pleads our
suits, and makes every case his own. And by and by he will come to take
us to himself, that where he is, there we may be also. In the mean time
he supplies all our wants, and this with a freeness, fulness,
suitableness, and all-sufficiency, that knows no bounds, to manifest the
unalterable friendship which he bears us. He visits us continually,
sympathises with us in all our afflictions, and increases with his
tender love the enjoyment of all our comforts; and all this, and a
thousand other nameless, numberless tokens, Jesus is continually
shewing, as proves that his whole heart and soul is our's. So that he is
a faithful, loving, constant, powerful, kind, everlasting, unchanging
Friend, that sticketh closer than a brother. My soul, what wilt thou say
to such a Friend? How wilt thou love him? Oh precious Lord, when! think
of thy love and my ingratitude—but Lord, it is thine to love, thine to
pity, thine to pardon. Lord, give me grace to appropriate thee to
myself; and while thou art still saying to me, and to thy church," I
have called you friends,"—may I say, "This is my Friend, and this is my
Beloved, O daughters of Jerusalem!"</p>

7—Evening—Hebrews 2:9</h3>
<p>"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for
the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour."—Heb. ii. 9.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, the very sweet and peculiar manner in which God the
Holy Ghost here speaks of Jesus. He was" made a little lower than the
angels, for the suffering of death." Yes! a body, such as ours, was
given him, for the express purpose of suffering. Our nature, by reason
of sin, required a sacrifice for sin. It behoved him, therefore, to be
in all things like unto his brethren. But when he had made his soul an
offering for sin, he for ever sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
on high. To none of the angels was it ever said, "Sit thou on my right
hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Now ponder these blessed
things, and then say, whether thou hast so seen Jesus? If so, thou hast
seen thy nature, in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, not only
exalted above all principality and power, and might and dominion, and
every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which
is to come; but thou hast seen him "crowned with glory and honour," as
the head of his body the church. I charge it upon thee, my soul, that in
all thy views of the Lord Jesus, as a risen and exalted Saviour, thou
for ever connect with it, and never lose sight of it, that it is Jesus,
as Jesus in his human nature, that is so exalted, so honoured, and
glorified. It would be no honour, but rather a degradation of the Son of
God, as God, to say such things of him, as being made, or receiving a
throne, or having glory given to him. All power, sovereignty, and might,
were his before. But when we behold Jesus as "made a little lower than
the angels," and becoming Mediator, he stands forth the servant of
Jehovah, redeeming his church and people; and, as such, "for the
suffering of death," is" crowned with glory and honour." And Oh! how
blessed the view! For if he was thus crowned in our nature, then surely
he will have respect to our nature in all the wants of his people. If he
be exalted in our nature, surely he is exalted in that nature" as a
Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of
sins." And if it be the same Lord Jesus, whose head is now crowned with
glory, that was once crowned with thorns: Oh! with what humble
confidence may a poor sinner, such as I am, look up, and tell him of the
glories of his cross, now shining with tenfold lustre in the glories of
his crown! Shall I not hope, dear Lord! by the sweet influences of thy
blessed Spirit, to make every day a coronation day, when by faith I
crown thee my true and lawful Sovereign, desiring to bring every thought
and affection of my poor heart into obedience to thee, to bow the knee
of my heart before thee, and with holy joy" confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father?" Amen.</p>

<p>"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which
the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me
only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."—2 Tim. iv. 8.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this blessed verse, and mark the very weighty
things contained in it. Many a soul is for deferring the thoughts of
this great day of God, and conclude, that the justification of the
sinner cannot be known until the day of judgment. But, my soul, see to
it, that thou art for bringing the firm and unshaken belief of it into
immediate possession and enjoyment now; for surely Jesus hath
effectually and fully provided for it. "Whom he called, them he also
justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified." See to it
then, my soul, that thou dost not suffer thyself to live a day, no, not
an hour, in a state of uncertainty upon a point of such infinite
consequence, in which the pardon of thy sins, and the justification of
thy person before God, is so highly concerned. If Jesus be thy Surety,
his righteousness and blood must be thy full justification before God,
and his salvation as much now as it will ever be. Pause then, and ask
thine heart, dost thou love his appearing? Suppose the trump of God was
this moment to sound, wouldest thou love his appearing? No doubt the
moment would be solemn, but would it not be glorious? Is Jesus thine;
his righteousness thine; his blood thy ransom? Wouldest thou love his
appearing if these things were sure? And what makes them not sure? Art
thou looking to any other righteousness? Hast thou not disclaimed all
other saviours? Ask thyself again; dost thou love his appearing, in the
season of ordinances, providences, retirements; in his word, in the
visits of his grace; at his table, his house of prayer, among his
churches, his people? Dost thou love his appearing in the conversion of
every poor sinner; and doth the same make thee to rejoice over the
recovery of such as angels do, when one repents? My soul, let these
things be among thy daily meditations concerning Jesus; for then will
thy meditation of him be sweet. And by thus making the justification of
thy person in the blood and righteousness of Jesus thy daily comfort,
thou wilt be prepared to love his appearing, in death, and finally at
judgment; that when the Master comes, and calleth for thee, thou mayest
arise with holy joy, and mount up to meet the Lord in the air, and
receive that crown of Jesus's righteousness which fadeth not away.</p>

<p>"And the Lord said unto Moses, is the Lord's hand waxed short? Thou
shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee, or
not."—Numb. xi. 23.</p>
<p>Is it not an extraordinary thing in the history of Moses, that he,
who had seen the miracles in Egypt, should stagger at God's promises to
feed his people with a new supply in the wilderness? Had Moses forgotten
the rock which gave water, or the daily supply of manna? But pause, my
soul! look not at Moses; look at home. What wonders hath thy God wrought
for thee! and yet what doubts, and fears, and questionings, are
continually arising in thy mind. Is there a child of God on earth, more
apt to reason with flesh and blood than thou art? And is there a child
of God, that hath less reason so to do? Dearest Lord! I blush to think
how slender, at times, my faith is! When I read of the acts of those
heroes in the gospel, who "through faith, subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, stopped the mouths of lions," and the like, I take shame
and confusion of face, in the review of my unbelieving heart. Did Joshua
bid the sun and moon to stand still; did Peter smite Ananias and
Sapphira dead; yea, did he even call Tabitha from the dead, by virtue of
faith in Jesus; and am I so much at a loss, at times, as to fear that I
shall one day perish by the hand of the enemy? Oh, Lord! I beseech thee,
strengthen my soul in this grace, that I may never more question the
divine faithfulness. And do thou, blessed Jesus, pour in thy resources
upon my poor forgetful and unbelieving heart, when doubts, and fears,
and misgivings arise. Give me to see, that in all my journey past, thou
hast brought me through difficulties and dangers, and that "thy strength
is made perfect in my weakness." What are all intervening difficulties,
when Jesus undertakes for his people? Nay, the very obstruction, be it
what it may, is but the more for the display of thy glory, and the
exercise of my faith. Help me then, O Lord, to look to thee, and not to
the difficulty, with which I have nothing to do. It is enough for me,
that my God hath promised, and my God can and will perform. How Jesus
will accomplish it, is his concern, and not mine. He is faithful; he
hath promised; and that is sufficient: the issue is not doubtful. Yea,
Lord! I know thine hand is not shortened, and all that thou hast said
must come to pass. "Faithful is he that hath promised, who also will do
it!"</p>

put out. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall never
go out."—Levit. vi. 1 2, 13.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul! behold the precept in one verse, and the promise in
the other. The Israelites was not to put out this altar fire; and
Jehovah promised that it should never go out. Neither did it, through
all the Jewish church, until Christ came. And if it be true that it
actually did expire (as it is said it did) the very year Christ died,
what is this hut a confirmation of the grand truth of God concerning the
putting away of sin by the blood of Christ? For is not fire an emblem,
through all the scriptures, of Jehovah's displeasure against sin? Ss not
God said to be a consuming fire? And by its burning, and that
miraculously preserved under all the Jewish dispensation, is it not
meant to manifest Jehovah's perpetual wrath, burning like fire against
sin? And as the fire was never extinguished upon the altar,
notwithstanding the numerous sacrifices offered, can any thing more
decidedly prove the inefficacy of sacrifices under the law, how
expensive soever they were, to take away sin? And is the fire now gone
out? Hath God himself indeed put it out! Then hath he accepted that one
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all, who came to put away
sin, and hath for ever put it away by the sacrifice of himself. Hail,
thou great, thou glorious, thou everlasting Redeemer! Thou art indeed
both the High Priest and the altar, both the Sacrifice and the
6acrificer, whose one offering hath both put out the fire of divine
wrath, and caused the holy flame of love and peace to burn in its stead,
which hath kindled in every heart of thy people. Yes, yes, thou Lamb of
God, it is thou which hast delivered us from the wrath to come! Thou
hast made our peace in the blood of thy cross. Thou hast quenched, by
thy blood the just fire of divine indignation against sin. Thou hast
quenched no less all the fiery darts of Satan. Thou hast subdued the
flaming enmity of our hearts, with all their fiery lusts and burning
affections. What shall I say to thee, what shall I say of thee, what
shall I proclaim concerning thee, Oh thou, the Lord our righteousness?
Lord, help me to begin the song, and never suffer sin or Satan—nay,
death itself, for a moment, to make an interruption in the heavenly
note; but let thy name fill my whole soul, and vibrate on my dying lips,
that I may open my eyes in eternity, while the words still hang there:
"To him who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
and made us kings and priests unto God and the Father; to him be glory
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."</p>

9—Evening—John 12:32</h3>
<p>"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
me."—John xii. 32.</p>
<p>My soul! it is blessed, and refreshing to the faith of God's
children, to behold, in their almighty Redeemer, the same properties as
are ascribed to the Father and the Spirit; and more especially in the
points which concern their personal salvation. Jesus told the Jews, that
none could come to him," except the Father, who had sent him, should
draw them;" John vi. 46. And in the same chapter, he ascribes "the
quickening power," which draws to Christ, unto the Holy Spirit, verse
63. But that his own sovereign power and Godhead is also included in
this act of grace, he here teacheth us, by describing whose love and
grace it is that sinners are drawn by! Precious Lord Jesus! let mine
eyes be ever unto thee for the quickening, reviving, restoring,
comforting, and all healing graces, which thou now art exalted, as a
Prince and a Saviour to give unto thy people. And dearest Lord! I
beseech thee, let my views of thee, and my meditation of thee, in this
most endearing character, be sweet in the consideration also, that thou,
as the head of thy church and people, must be the head of all spiritual,
life-giving influences. Surely, blessed Jesus, the head cannot be happy,
if the members be not made blessed; the source and fountain of all
goodness must needs send forth streams to impart of its overflowing
fulness. And is it not for this very purpose, that as God-man Mediator,
"the Father hath given thee power over all flesh, that thou shouldest
give eternal life to as many as the Father hath given thee?" John xvii.
2. And will not Jesus delight to dispense all blessings to his people,
to his chosen, that are the purchase of his blood, and the gift of his
Father, and the conquests of his grace? I feel my soul warmed with the
very thought! I say to myself, ' Did my Lord and Saviour say, when upon
earth, that he was "anointed to preach the gospel to the poor, to heal
the broken in heart, and to give out of his fulness grace for grace?"
And did my Lord say, moreover, that when "he was lifted up, he would
draw all men unto him?" And shall I not feel the drawing, the
constraining graces of his Spirit, bringing my whole heart, and soul,
and spirit into an unceasing desire after him, and unceasing longing for
him, and an everlasting enjoyment of him?' Precious, blessed Lord Jesus!
let the morning, noon-day, and evening cry of my heart be in the
language of the church of old, and let the cry be awakened by thy grace,
and answered in thy mercy: "Draw me, we will run after thee: the king
hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee;
we will remember thy love more than wine;" Song i. 4.</p>

10—Morning—2 Timothy 1:9</h3>
<p>"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was
given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began."—2 Timothy i. 9.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, all the precious things, if thou hast power or time to
do so, which are contained in this blessed scripture. Eternity itself
will not be sufficient to allow space to enumerate them; neither will
thy ripened faculties, even when full-blown and full-fruited, be found
sufficient to enter into the complete apprehension of them all. Who is
it that is here said to have saved ns, and called us with an holy
calling, but the holy, glorious, undivided Jehovah, existing in a
threefold character of Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? For all have
concurred in that blessed work; and all, in the essence of the One
Jehovah, must have the joint praise and the joint glory to all eternity.
Well, then, put thy salvation down to this glorious account: it is God
who hath saved and called thee. Next, mark the order here set forth.
Thou art said to be saved before thou art said to be called. Mark that!
salvation precedes our knowledge of it. The covenant engagements of the
Almighty Covenanters took place from everlasting. For so saith the
apostle concerning the hopes of happiness founded on salvation: "In
hope," saith he, "of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promised
before the world began." Next, my soul, take notice of the call itself.
It is an holy call: for we are called to the fellowship and communion of
Jesus Christ. "And as he who hath called us is holy, so are we called to
be holy, in all manner of conversation and godliness." See to it, my
soul, that thy fellowship and communion is in the holiness and
sin-atoning blood of Jesus. Lastly, never, my soul, lose sight of the
cause of these unspeakable mercies—no, not for a moment. "We are saved
and called, not according to our works, but according to his purpose."
Hence, what is God's gift, cannot be man's merit; and what resulted from
infinite love, from all eternity, cannot flow from creature love in
time. Blessed purpose, and blessed grace: and thrice-blessed, being
given to us in God's dear Son, even Christ Jesus, before the world
began!</p>

10—Evening—Hebrews 1:14</h3>
<p>"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation?"—Heb. i. 14.</p>
<p>My soul, art thou an heir of salvation? Think then of thy high
privilege. "If," saith an apostle, "we are children, then heirs, yea,
heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ," Rom. viii. 17. Though in
this life, we be in a state of childhood, and, under age, yet by
adoption and grace, we are made "heirs of God." Not like men of the
world, in their earthly portions, where only one in a family can be the
heir, and that the first-born; but all the church are included, for the
church itself is called "the first-born which are written in heaven,"
Heb. xii. 25. And in this heaven-born inheritance, thou hast, my soul,
if thou be a child of God, a portion in God thy Father; for all his
people are a nation of spiritual priests, who, like Aaron of old, "have
the Lord for their portion," Numb. xviii. 20. Yea, by virtue of thy
union to Christ, who, as God-man Mediator, is "heir of all things," thou
art interested in all things which are his, by virtue of his mediation.
Oh, the rapturous thought! But do not stop here. By reason of this
heirship, behold thy high dignity! Angels, who are high in intellect,
disembodied spirits, and who excel in wisdom and in power, are servants
in thine Emmanuel's kingdom, to minister unto thee, and to all thy
brethren in Jesus who are heirs of salvation. Oh! couldest thou see how
they watch over thee, how they guard thee from a thousand evils; didst
thou but know how eternally safe thou art amidst a host of foes, which
come against thee; then, like the prophet's servant, thou wouldest
frequently see, by the eye of faith, "the mountain around thee full of
horses and chariots of fire," 2 Kings vi. 17. And who shall say to what
extent their ministry is exercised? If a single angel destroyed seventy
thousand in the host of Israel, at the command of God, (2 Sam. xxiv.
15.) and a hundred and fourscore and five thousand of the Assyrians
which came forth against Israel, (2 Kings xix. 35.) what may not the
child of God hope for, who is an heir of salvation, from the perpetual
ministry of these ministering spirits? Oh! thou dear Lord, cause thine
holy angels thus, by night and day, to take their stand, and watch over
my defenceless hours! And, yet more than this, my adored Redeemer! come
thou, and bless me with the unceasing visits of thy love, and say to me,
as to thy church of old; "Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not
dismayed, for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee, yea, I will uphold
thee with the right hand of my righteousness," Isa. xli. 10.</p>

11—Morning—Hebrews 11:4</h3>
<p>"By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain."—Heb. xi. 4.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost hath here marked down, by his servant the apostle, in
the very first offerings which we read of in the bible, the vast
importance of faith; by which it most decidedly proves, that it is faith
which gives efficacy to all the offerings of his creatures. Faith in
what? Nay—there can be but one view of faith throughout the word of God;
namely, faith in the promised seed to bruise the serpent's head. This
was the first promise which came in upon the fall. Every offering,
therefore, offered unto God, unless it had an eye to this, became
offensive. Cain did not offer the first-fruits of the ground with an eye
of faith in Christ—hence, he was the first deist the world ever knew.
Abel, by faith, offered the firstlings of his flock with an eye to
Jesus—and hence the testimony that God respected his offering. What a
striking evidence is here, ray soul, of the vast and infinite importance
of faith. Cain made an offering to God, and by so doing, he did, as the
deists now do, acknowledge God to be his Creator; but not looking to him
as a Redeemer, and thereby intimating that he needed none, both his
person and his offering were rejected. Meditate on this, my soul, and
learn by grace to mix faith in all that concerns thy soul. Oh keep an
eye on Jesus, convinced that "there is no other name under heaven given
among men whereby we must be saved." And if, through the gracious
teachings of the Spirit, in taking of the things of Jesus, and shewing
them unto thee, thou art able daily to apprehend by faith, and bring him
(as the bee doth from the flower) his person, his work, his character,
his relations, his grace, and righteousness, as the sent, and sealed,
and anointed, of the Father, full of grace and truth; by thus living
upon him, and living to him, and making him what he is to all his
people, the Alpha and Omega of thy salvation; faith in him will give a
sweet leaven to all thy poor prayers, and praises, and offerings, and
thou wilt find favour with God, to the praise of the glory of his grace,
who maketh thee accepted in the Beloved.</p>

11—Evening—Philippians 2:6, 7</h3>
<p>"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God, but made himself of no reputation."—Phil. ii. 6, 7.</p>
<p>My soul, after all thy meditations upon the person of thy Lord, how
very far short hast thou come in thy thoughts of the unequalled humility
of the Son of God! Let thy present evening's contemplation be on this
subject. But where, and at what part shall I enter upon it. Who shall
speak, or what heart conceive the wonders contained in it! Blessed
Spirit of all truth! do thou glorify the Lord Jesus to my evening
meditation, in this interesting view of his person. He that, before all
worlds, lay in the bosom of the Father, and was attended by the services
of legions of angels, condescended to be made not only flesh, but in the
likeness of sinful flesh; to be born in a stable, and to sleep in a
manger; to advance in human intellect, and grow in wisdom and in
stature; to labour for bread, and to gain that bread by the sweat of the
brow; and, having spent an eternity in glory with the Father, to spend
thirty years in poverty and want among men! Go on, my soul, in the
meditation. Follow Jesus till thou hast beheld him, not only having no
where to lay his head, but becoming the scorn and sport of the
multitude; and he, who had been, and still was, and ever will be the
delight and glory of the Father, branded by men, even by many of them he
came to save, as a blasphemer, and one that had a devil! Sit down and
ponder over these wonderful things; and then ask, what can raise
affections in the soul, if such views of Jesus do not? Think what must
have been the Father's love in giving his dear Son to such a purpose?
and what must have been the Son's love in coming? Then ask thyself, what
indignities oughtest thou not to submit to among men, if called upon to
such an exercise, while contemplating the unequalled humility of thy
Redeemer? Dearest Lord Jesus!! blush in the moment of recollection,
while beholding thy real glory thus veiled under the cloud of
humiliation, to think how often for trifles, yea, less than trifles, the
false pride of my poor fallen nature hath felt hurt at some fancied
inattention from men. Oh! for the same mind to be in me "which was in
Christ Jesus!" He made himself of no reputation!</p>

12—Morning—Habakkuk 3:19</h3>
<p>"To the chief singer on my stringed instruments."—Hab. iii. 19.</p>
<p>My soul, take down thine harp from the willow; and now the night is
past, let the first of the morn find thee going forth, in the matin of
praise, to the chief singer on all the instruments of his grace, which
he hath strung thine heart to use to his glory. And who is this chief
singer, but Jesus? Doth not the prophet say, "The Lord God is my
strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me
to walk in mine high places?" Surely he that is the Lord God of my
salvation, is the chief singer, and chief musician of my song. And he
that will be my portion, my everlasting portion in the upper world, will
be my strength and song in this. Surely David would not have directed,
as he hath, in such numberless places, his psalms to a singer among men,
in the temple service, when the whole scope of the psalm itself treats
of the Lord, and of his Christ. The root of the word singer, or musician
itself, means the end. And" Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to every one that believeth." Come then, my soul, strike
up this morning this hymn of praise. God the Holy Ghost is exciting
thee. It is he which points to Jesus. He shews the king in his beauty,
and bids thee behold his suitableness, transcendent excellencies, grace,
love, favour, glory. Carry, then, all thy concerns to this chief
musician. Put forth all thy strength to praise him, that while Jesus is
attentive to the hallelujahs of heaven, he may hear thy feeble note,
amidst all the songs which are offered him, giving glory to his great
name, from the uttermost parts of the earth. Follow the prophet's
example, and let the goings forth of thy warmest desires be to the chief
singer on thy stringed instruments:—The Lord is my strength and my
shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped; therefore my heart
greatly rejoiceth, and in my song will I praise him."</p>

12—Evening—Psalm 106:35</h3>
<p>"But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works."—Ps.
cvi. 35.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this view of God's people of old. There is a
natural disposition in the heart, to do and to live as others, in order
to pass through life with as little reproach as possible; and, in the
first face of things, what is called an innocent conformity to the world
seems to be commendable and praiseworthy. But, alas! it is impossible to
mingle with the carnal, and not to learn their works; and it is always
dangerous to get on the confines of the enemy. In that blessed prayer,
taught us by our Lord, we pray "not to be led into temptation;" and
surely this implies, that we do not desire to lead ourselves into
temptation. But this every child of God doth, that mingles unnecessarily
with the world, or with the men of the world. The precept is positive to
this purpose; "Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." And the blessing is as positive
of the gracious effects that shall follow: "And I will receive you, and
will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
the Lord Almighty," 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. My soul, do thou make a
memorandum of this, for thou art too apt to forget it. How often hast
thou been found in places and with persons, where the voice might have
been heard speaking to thee, as unto the prophet, "What doest thou here,
Elijah?" And often hast thou returned wounded from such society, where,
to speak of him "whom thou lovest," forms no part in the conversation;
but where the frivolous and unprofitable discourse too plainly testifies
that "neither is God in all their thoughts." Precious Jesus! keep me, I
beseech thee, from the heathen of every description and character, and
suffer me "not to mingle with them, nor learn their works;" but let my
whole heart be fixed on thee, considering how "thou didst endure such a
contradiction of sinners against thyself," that I may be never weary nor
faint in mind.</p>

13—Morning—1 Leviticus 2:13</h3>
<p>"And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt;
neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be
lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offering thou shalt offer
salt."—Lev. ii. 13.</p>
<p>Ponder over these words, my soul, and looking up for grace, and the
divine teachings, see whether Jesus is not sweetly typified here. Was
not Jesus the whole sum and substance of every offering under the law?
The Holy Ghost taught the church this, when he said, "the law was a
shadow of good things to come, but the body is of Christ." And did not
the church, by faith, behold him as the salt which seasoned and made
savoury the whole? Moreover, as all the sacrifices were wholly directed
to typify him who knew no sin, but became sin for his people; the
seasoning the sacrifice with salt, which was also a type of Christ's
purity and sinlessness, became a sweet representation, to denote that a
sinner, when he came with his offering, came by faith; to intimate that
he looked for acceptance in the Lord as his sacrifice, and for
preservation in the salt of his grace, in Christ Jesus. And who then,
among believers now, would ever approach without an eye to Jesus, and
the seasoning with this salt all his poor offerings. Lord, grant that
the salt of the covenant of my God may never be lacking; for where Jesus
is not, there can be no acceptance. Lord, let me have this salt in
myself, and may every renewed presentation of myself be there salted.
Then shall I be as the salt of the earth, amidst not only the
putrefaction of the world, but the corruptions of my own heart. Lord,
say to us, and impart the blessing of thyself in saying it, "Have salt
in yourselves;" and then shall we have peace with thee, and with one
another.</p>

13—Evening—Deuteronomy 21:20, 21</h3>
<p>"And they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is
stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton,
and a drunkard. And alt the men of his city shall stone him with stones,
that he die."—Deut. xxi. 20, 21.</p>
<p>My soul, pause over this Jewish precept. What a thundering command
must it have been to flesh and blood! Think, how agonizing to the
feelings of tender parents, to have come forth as the accusers of
rebellious children, and gluttons and drunkards! What comfort could such
have concerning them in their welfare of the life that now is, and what
hope for that which is to come? But, as if these distressing feelings
were not enough, it is they, the very parents, which are here commanded
to bring forward the charge to the elders against their own bowels, and
they are to be the means of bringing them to death. But, painful as it
must have been to flesh and blood, such were the triumphs of grace,
that, by virtue of it, "all Israel was to hear and to fear;" and if God
was honoured, and the evil of rebellion put away, the close was
glorious. Better to follow a child to the grave, than follow that child
to hell. Better to root out a noxious weed from Christ's garden, the
church, than that it should live, and bring forth and spread its deadly
fruit. And is there not a sweet spiritual lesson in all this? Look at
it, my soul, and see. Hast thou a stubborn and rebellious lust warring
against the law of thy mind, and bringing thee into captivity to the law
of sin, which is in thy members? And dost thou groan, as Paul groaned
under it? Is it like a child in thine affection, that to destroy it is
like plucking out an eye, or cutting off an arm? Do by it as the Lord
commanded the poor oppressed father to do by his son. Bring it, be it
what it may, not before the elders of thy people indeed, but before the
Lord of heaven and earth; bring it to Jesus, and tell him of thy burden,
and shew to him thy sorrow. I venture to believe, that he will give
grace to crush it, and strength, like so many stones of the people, to
beat it down in thine heart, and it will be to his glory, and to thy
joy. Oh! the blessedness of bringing all to Jesus! He can, he will
subdue the stubborn heart, break the power of the rebellious heart,
restrain the propensity of the gluttonous or sottish heart, and give
suited help to the several necessities of his people, so as to make the
soul cry out, under the blessed strength imparted to our weakness, "I
can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me." Help me then,
dear Lord, and help all thy children, under their several infirmities,
by thy Spirit, "to mortify the deeds of the body, that we may live."</p>

<p>"And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them
speedily."—Luke xviii. 7, 8.</p>
<p>My soul, mark for thy encouragement, in all thine approaches to a
throne of grace, what Jesus here speaks, and never lose sight of it.
Remember how well acquainted he, who came out of the bosom of the
Father, mast be with the Father's mind and will towards his people, over
and above the gracious exercise of his priestly office in their behalf.
Now, my soul, do mark down distinctly what blessed things are here
promised. First—God's people are said in it to be his elect, his chosen,
his jewels. "This people," saith God, "I have formed for myself; they
shall shew forth my praise." Secondly—God's people are a praying people;
"they cry day and night to him;" they are unceasing in their
applications; and they wrestle, like their father Jacob in prayer:
"Lord, I will not let thee go except thou bless me." Give me Jesus, and
in him I shall have all things. He will subdue this corruption; he will
soften this affliction; he will conquer Satan, and with him, all his
temptations. Thirdly—God's people will and must be exercised. There will
be sometimes long silence at the throne. The enemy will endeavour to
improve this to strengthen his temptation; he will suggest, 'God hath
forgotten thee; he will return no more; he hath cast thee off.'
Lastly—mark what Jesus saith; "Shall not God avenge his own elect, who
cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?" Yes, yes, he
will, I tell you, saith one who could not be mistaken; "he will avenge
them, and that speedily." When the hour of deliverance comes, it shall
come so sudden, so sweet, so unexpected, that all their long waiting
shall be forgotten; and it shall seem as if that promise of answering
before they called was in it. And he will not only bless them, but
avenge them of their foes. And whence all this, my soul, but because he
is the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation. His people are his
chosen, the gift of his love, the purchase of Jesus's blood, the
conquests of his Holy Spirit. Lord, cause me ever to keep those precious
things in remembrance, and to hang on, and hold out, and never, never to
give over pleading in Jesus, until I hear that precious voice, "Be it
unto thee, even as thou wilt."</p>

14—Evening—Romans 10:8, 9, 10</h3>
<p>"The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is
the word of faith which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy
mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath
raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man
believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation.—Rom. x. 8, 9, 10.</p>
<p>My soul, behold the tenderness of God the Holy Ghost to his people,
in order to prevent the possibility of error, in their knowledge and
enjoyment of Christ. It is not difficult to attain a clear apprehension,
whether a soul be in grace, or not; for here the point is most plainly
set forth; "The word is nigh thee." What word? The word of faith. Christ
in the word, Christ in the promise, Christ himself the salvation of the
sinner. And when a poor sinner hath been led to see who Christ is, and
what he hath wrought, what he hath done for sinners, and what he is to
them; the infinite glories of his person, the infinite perfection and
completeness of his work, and the infinite suitableness of Jesus in
every possible way that a poor sinner can need, by way of justification
before God, and acceptance with God; then these blessed truths are so
sweetly brought home to the heart and conscience of the enlightened
sinner, by God the Holy Ghost, that he rests upon Christ as one
perfectly satisfied with Christ, and neither seeks nor desires any
other. So that by the lively actings of faith, the soul beholds Christ
in the word, and in the promise, and takes him with both into his very
soul, until Christ is fully "formed there the hope of glory." Hence,
both the outward confession of the mouth, and the inward enjoyment of
the heart, have a beautiful correspondence; the one speaks what the
other feels; "for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
My soul, is not this faith? And if so, what can dispossess thee of it?
What shall stop thy joy or confidence in Jesus a single hour? If Jesus,
the uncreated word, the promised word, the sum and substance of all the
written word, be nigh thee, yea, in thy mouth and in thine heart; not
only thine understanding knows Jesus, but thine heart lives upon Jesus;
surely salvation is secure; yea, heaven itself is begun in the soul; for
"this is life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
he hath sent!"</p>

<p>"The good will of him that dwelt in the bush."—Deut. xxxiii. 16.</p>
<p>And who is this, my soul; who indeed can it be but Jesus? Surely he
is the glorious person. It was good will, in the highest possible
instance of it, that prompted his infinite mind, from everlasting, to
love his people, to engage for them in suretyship engagements, and to
stand up and come forth, at the call of God the Father, as the head of
his body the church. It was a continuation of the same good will which
prompted him, in the fulness of time, to assume our nature for the
purposes of fulfilling those engagements. Then it was, indeed, he dwelt
in the bush; for what is our nature, at the best, but a poor dry bramble
bush, fit for burning? But yet, by Christ in it, so sustained, and so
preserved, that though the bush burns with fire, even the fiery lusts of
our corruptions, and the fiery darts of the wicked, and all the fiery
opposition of the world, it shall not be consumed. Precious Jesus! what
good will hast thou shewn, dost thou shew, and everlastingly wilt shew,
to our poor nature, since thou hast been in it, and art now, indeed, the
dweller in it. And did Moses, when dying, thus connect the first views
of thy love, when from the burning bash thou didst make thyself known to
him, as God tabernacling in our flesh, for the purpose of salvation,
with his last views as he was closing his eyes to this world, and
looking up to thee as God-man Mediator, and thus pray for thy good will
to the church? Oh then, let my every-day meditation do the same. Lord
Jesus, I would seek thee and thy good will beyond all the riches of the
earth, and all the enjoyments of the world. Lord, I would never forget
that it was thy good will which brought thee down from heaven; thy good
will which prompted thee to die, to rise again, for poor sinners; thy
good will which makes thee wash them from all their sins in thy blood;
all the visits of thy grace here, all the glories of redemption
hereafter; all are the purchase and the result of thy good will.
Precious Lord, do thou, day by day, grant me renewed tokens of thy good
will; and let those visits be so gracious, so sweet, and so continual,
that I may think of nothing else, speak of nothing else, but the good
will of my dweller in the bush. I would pray for grace to spend all the
moments of my life here in receiving from thee grace and love, and
bringing to thee love and praise, until thou shalt take me home to live
at the fountain of thy good will, and the whole happiness of eternity
consists in the praises of God and the Lamb, and in enjoying" the good
will of him that dwelt in the bush."</p>

15—Evening—Psalm 65:3</h3>
<p>"Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt
purge them away."—Psalm lxv. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder over this important verse. It is but short, but it is
full of precious things. Blessed the man that can, from his heart, make
use of what is here said as his own experience! He hath learned much of
Christ, that can do so. In a time when a sense of sin abounds, when
comforts run low, and the rebellion of the remains of indwelling
corruptions riseth high; when the enemy cometh in like a flood, and no
answers return from the sanctuary; yea, when the very spirit of prayer
fails, and the heaven that is over the head, is as brass, and the earth
that is under the feet, is as iron; then to rest simply upon Christ, and
to say, "Iniquities prevail against me!" I feel the dreadful
consequences of a fallen state; but all those transgressions Jesus will
purge them away; though the Canaanites are yet in the land, my almighty
Joshua will, by little and little, drive them out before me, until they
are utterly destroyed;" to say these things, and to know them, and, by a
firm reliance on Jesus, to depend upon the accomplishment of them, is to
have faith in lively exercise indeed! This is to rest on God the
Father's covenant engagement, and Jesus's person and righteousness only,
and at a time, when, of all others, perhaps faith is hard put to it, to
call Christ our own. Oh! the blessedness of this state of the soul, when
a sense of prevailing iniquities, instead of damping the actings of
faith, becomes a stimulus to look to Jesus, and to call in his powerful
hand to restrain, when a man is driven out of himself, to lay hold on
the blessed Jesus! My soul, hast thou thus far advanced in the school of
grace? Happy, happy indeed, if a daily sense of thy nothingness tends
more and more to endear the Lord's all-sufficiency! And blessed will be
the final issue of that divine teaching which brings thee at last most
low and humble at the feet of Jesus, content to be nothing, yea, worse
than nothing, that Jesus may have all the glory, who is alone worthy of
it, in the salvation of his people.</p>

16—Morning—Song of Solomon 1:5</h3>
<p>I am black, but comely."—Song i. 5.</p>
<p>See, my soul, whether thine experience corresponds to that of the
church. Hast thou learnt from God the Spirit what thou art in thyself?
Art thou truly sensible of the many sins and corruptions which lurk
under fair appearances; and that, from carrying about with thee a body
of sin and death, as the apostle said he did, in thee, that is, in thy
flesh, dwelleth no good thing? Dost thou appear not only black in thine
own view, but art thou despised for Christ's sake, and counted the
offscouring of all things in the view of the world? Pause, my soul. Now
look at the bright side. Art thou comely in Christ's righteousness,
which he hath put upon thee? Comely in the sweet sanctifying grace of
the Holy Ghost dwelling in thee? Comely in the eyes of God the Father,
from being accepted in Jesus the Beloved? Comely in church communion and
fellowship, walking in the fear of God, and under the comforts of the
Holy Ghost? What sayest thou, my soul, to these sweet but soul-searching
testimonies? If thou canst now take up the language of the church: "I am
black, but comely;" lowly in thine own eyes, selfloathing,
self-despising, self-abhorring; but in Jesus rejoicing, and in his
salvation triumphing all the day; think, my soul, what will it be when
the King, in whose comeliness thou art comely, shall take thee home, as
a bride adorned for her husband, and thou shalt then be found, "not
having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing," but shalt be everlastingly
holy, and without blame before him in love.</p>

16—Evening—Isaiah 44:23</h3>
<p>"Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower parts
of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and
every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified
himself in Israel."—Isa. xliv. 23.</p>
<p>Come, my soul, and join this universal hymn of praise, this lovely
evening. Surely, if the Lord, by his servant the prophet, calls upon all
nature, both the animate and inanimate parts of creation, to join in the
melody, well may" the redeemed of the Lord say so!" The heavens shall
sing the song of redemption; for angels rejoice over converted sinners.
The earth shall join the song; for the curse pronounced on the ground is
taken away by redemption. Yea, the very trees of the desert, the most
remote from the peopled city, in beholding the felicity of God's chosen,
shall clap their hands also. And mark, my soul, what is the running
verse and chorus of this blessed song? It is Jehovah's glory; "for the
Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel." Precious and
principal feature in redemption! for what is God's work is God's glory.
Think of this, when thou art contemplating the wonders and glories of
redemption. And, moreover, let these views of divine glory, the first
and ultimate end, in creation, providence, and grace, become the
assurance, and security, and comfort of thy mind, under all the
remaining points to be accomplished in thy personal circumstances, and
interest in it. The Lord hath glorified himself, and will glorify
himself in his people. Israel is the people of his purpose, the children
of promise, the children of adoption, the objects of his choice, of his
everlasting love; the seed of Christ; the purchase of his blood. "This
people, (saith Jehovah) have I formed for myself, they shall shew forth
my praise." Pause, my soul, and ask thy heart, what can shew forth God's
praise in any way equal to all our conceptions of Jehovah's glory, more
than by a way so gracious, so wonderful, and so passing all
understanding, as that of taking them from nothing, yea, from worse than
nothing, and constituting them a church, a people in Christ, his dear
Son, to be the everlasting monument of his glory and praise, in the
realms of eternity for ever? Well might the prophet exclaim, and well
mayest thou join the song: "Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done
it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye
mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed
Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel."</p>

17—Morning—John 5:25</h3>
<p>"The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear
shall live."—John v. 25.</p>
<p>What a promise is here, and what an encouragement for every dead
sinner to hope, and for every living saint, who is interested for dead
sinners, not to despair? Observe, my soul, the extensiveness of the
mercy: it is the dead. Why, all are dead in trespasses and sins. Is
there not hope then for all? "And they that hear shall live." Why, then,
every sinner should ask his heart-do I hear? But, my soul, mark how this
is done. It is by the voice of the Son of God. Yes; there is salvation
in no other. He saith himself, "I am the resurrection and the life: he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and
whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die." But, my soul,
while taking comfort from this blessed passage, as it concerns poor dead
sinners, ask thine own heart whether thou hast been the happy partaker
of it thyself. Hast thou heard the voice of the Son of God? Yes; if so
be thou livest in him, and upon him, and walkest with him. Jesus's voice
is a quickening voice, a life-giving voice, a soul-feeding,
soul-strengthening, heart-warming, heartbreaking, heart-melting voice.
What sayest thou, my soul, to these examinations? Oh if Jesus's voice
hath been ever heard by thee, thou wilt be desiring the renewal of it
from day to day, and thou wilt be saying, in the earnest language of the
church: "let me hear thy voice, let me see thy countenance; for sweet is
thy voice, and thy countenance is comely."</p>

<p>"Never man spake like this man."—John vii. 46.</p>
<p>What a decided testimony were even the enemies of Christ compelled,
from their own consciences, to give to the Godhead and power of the Lord
Jesus Christ! Think then, my soul, what an evidence thou wouldest bring,
if called upon to tell what Jesus hath said to thee! From the first
moment that Jesus revealed himself, in his word, and by his word, to thy
heart, thou couldest truly say, as the Jewish officers did, "Never man
spake like this man." Never any spake like this God-man, this Glory-man,
thy Redeemer. All his words were, and are divine words; powerful,
persuasive, tender, gracious words, and full of salvation. Say, also,
how very blessed all that Jesus spake of salvation was to thy heart,
when he made it personal, and spake it all to thee. When he said, I am
thy salvation. I have pardon, I have peace, I have righteousness, I have
grace here, and glory hereafter; and all I have is for thee. So that
when reading the word, or hearing the word, and the question arose in
thy heart, to whom speaketh my Lord thus? Oh! how unspeakably precious
did the word become, when Jesus said by his servant, "To you is the word
of this salvation sent." Precious Lord Jesus! how shall I express my
soul's sense of thy love and grace, thy mercy and favour? Since thou
first manifested thyself to my heart, I am no longer my own. Thou hast
taken all my affections with thee to heaven, and caused them to center
every thing in thyself. And now, Lord, I still daily, yea, sometimes
hourly, when I hear thy voice, am constrained to cry out," Never man
spake like this man!" How sweet and suitable are thy words to my weary
soul; thou hast indeed" the tongue of the learned, and knowest how to
speak in season to souls, (like mine) that are weary," Isa. i. 4. How
truly blessed and seasonable is thy well-known voice to my soul, when a
sense of my nothingness makes thy fulness yet more precious. Oh! when I
hear thee say, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made
perfect in weakness;" surely, Lord, I feel a power that makes all my
enemies seem as nothing. Like thy servant, I then truly" glory in my
infirmities, that thy power may rest upon me." Be thou then, dearest
Lord Jesus, all I need, and let me hear thy voice, and see thy
countenance; for both in life and in death, in time, and to all
eternity, the voice of my Lord Jesus will be my everlasting comfort, for
none speaketh like thee!</p>

<p>"Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto
those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink and forget his poverty, and
remember his misery no more."—Prov. xxxi. 6, 7.</p>
<p>What is the strong drink of the gospel but the covenant love,
faithfulness, and grace of Jehovah? And what is the wine of the gospel
but the love of Jesus, which the church saith is better than wine? Tell
a poor sinner that is ready to perish, of God the Father's everlasting
love towards his people, who were all by nature sinners ready to perish,
when God passed by and bid them live; tell them that such was God's love
that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all that believe in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life; tell them of Jesus,
his Godhead, his Manhood—both natures united in one person, forming one
Christ; tell them, that faith in his blood will save the soul; that God
the Father hath respect only to the person and worth of his dear Son;
and that for his sake, and his sake alone, the greatest saint, and the
greatest sinner, if believers, are alike saved. This is strong drink;
and a poor perishing sinner needs the cordial. Neither will the heavy in
heart be any more sad, that thus is made to drink of the wine of the
gospel. My soul, hast thou tasted of this strong drink? Oh then, take
the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord! Drink of this
cup which Jesus puts into thine hand, and in his riches forget thy
poverty, and in his free, and full, and finished redemption remember
thine own misery no more. Live only to Jesus, and let him be thy strong
drink, thy wine, and thy cordial for ever.</p>

18—Evening—Matthew 17:5</h3>
<p>"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them."—Matt.
xvii. 5.</p>
<p>My soul! see here, how it fared with the disciples in the mount, in
the moment of those blessed manifestations which Jesus was making to
them; and when, to heighten their felicity, several of the inhabitants
of glory came, and spake to Jesus in the view of his disciples; yet so
sudden was the change, that, even while Jesus spake, a cloud intervened
and obscured all. Somewhat of the same change thou hast thyself known.
How often hast thou been made like the chariots of Amminadib, by the
overpowering grace that Jesus hath shewn thee! And how often have those
blessed moments been followed by a dark and long night! And what ought
to be thy improvement of these dispensations? Look still to Jesus, under
all. Whatever changes are induced, never forget that his person is the
same, and his love the same. Mark this down. Next look up to Jesus, and
tell him, that as his visits are so sweet, so gracious, and blessed,
entreat the dear Lord to be often coming, often blessing thee with his
love, and making his abode with thee. And see that thou art improving
every occasion, and making the most of those hallowed seasons; for they
are most blessed and precious; while thy Lord is with thee, and feasting
thee with his love, and shewing thee his secret mark, the Bethel-places,
made sacred by his presence, and the Bethel communications, made
pleasant by coming from him. And do not forget to interest Jesus for
Zion. Tell him that Zion is his own, and thou knowest that he loves her.
Then, on the ground of this love, tell him how she languisheth, in the
present awful day of much profession, with but little vital godliness.
And while the king is held by thee in the galleries of his grace, bring
in the arms of thy faith all thou wouldest seek a blessing for; thy
children, if thou hast any, thy family, the church at large, the nation;
and do, as did the patriarch, wrestle, plead, hold fast, and take no
refusal, but say, 'Lord, thou comest to bless, and a blessing I must
have;" neither will I let thee go, except thou bless me."'</p>

19—Morning—Song of Solomon 5:10</h3>
<p>"My beloved is white and ruddy."—Song v. 10.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, and contemplate thy Redeemer this morning under this
engaging description of his person. It opens a delightful subject for
meditation, in several points of view. Jesus is white and ruddy, if
considered in his human nature only, He might be said to be white, in
reference to the immaculate holiness of his body, underived as it was
from a sinful stock like ours. He was born of the Virgin Mary by the
miraculous conception of the Holy Ghost, and therefore emphatically
called, that HOLY THING: agreeably to all which, his whole life was
without sin or shadow of imperfection. "Such an High Priest become us,
who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher
than the heavens." Hence Jesus was truly white, as the Lamb of God,
without blemish, and without spot. And was he not ruddy also, in his
bloody sufferings, when his head was crowned with thorns, and his side
pierced on the cross? Was he not ruddy in the garden, when his agony was
so great as to force blood through all the pores of his sacred body,
which fell in great drops on the ground. Behold, my soul, thy beloved in
both these views, and say,—Is he not white and ruddy? But do not stop
here. Look at him again, and contemplate the Lord Jesus as the Christ of
God, in his two natures, divine and human, and say in the union of
both—Is he not white and ruddy? What can set forth the glories of the
Godhead to our apprehension more lovely than the purity of whiteness,
which, as in the mount of transfiguration, became a brightness too
dazzling for mortal sight to behold? And what can represent the human
nature more strikingly than the ruddiness of the countenance? Adam, the
first mall, takes his very name from hence; for Adam, or Adamah,
signifies red earth. And such, then, was Jesus. And is he then, my soul,
white and ruddy to thy view? And is he also thy beloved? Oh then, let
him be thy morning, noon-day, evening, midnight meditation; and let him
be sweet to thee, as he is to his church and people—the beloved who is
white and ruddy?</p>

19—Evening—Exodus 5:22, 23</h3>
<p>"And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast
thou so evil intreated this people? Why is it that thou hast sent me?
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to
this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."—Exod. v.
22, 23.</p>
<p>My soul! ponder over this scripture, and the history connected with
it, and behold what a blessed volume of instruction it affords. The Lord
sent Moses to deliver his people out of Egypt. He had heard their
groanings, and graciously promised to redress them. The people believed
the Lord, and bowed their heads, in token of their view of his love, and
their own happiness, which was now to follow. But behold, the oppression
under which they had groaned, instead of lessening, began to increase.
In this state they grow desperate, and charge God foolishly. Yea, Moses
himself, who had talked with God at the bush, and seen the miracles in
confirmation of his commission there shewn, becomes tainted with the
same spirit of unbelief, and returned to expostulate with Jehovah on the
occasion.—Pause over this view of the human heart, even in God's own
people. The sequel of Israel's history sheweth, that the Lord was
pursuing one invariable plan for the deliverance of his people, as he
had promised; and that there was no alteration in him. He was only
laying his glorious scheme the deeper by seeming opposition, to make his
people's emancipation more blessed, and his love of them more striking.
But yet, while things appeared thus dark and unpromising, Israel forgot
all that the Lord had promised.—And how is it, my soul, with thyself?
When the promises of God seem to clash with his providences, and
according to thy narrow views, seem impossible to be brought into
agreement with each other, how dost thou act? Art thou not like Israel,
much disposed to reason with flesh and blood? When the enemies of thy
peace triumph, and carry things, as Pharaoh did in this instance with
Israel, with a high hand, saying, "Aha! so would we have it;" when
unbelief creeps in, or a lust, which thou hadst hoped was subdued,
breaks out afresh, like some peccant humour of the body; when no answers
are heard to thy prayers; and though thou art falling under some renewed
temptation, yet there appears no hand of Jesus stretched forth to bring
thee off, and raise thee up: say, my soul! under such dark providences,
how dost thou conduct thyself towards the Lord? Oh for grace to trace
Jesus, more especially in trying seasons than even in prosperous
moments; and to hear his voice in the whirlwind and the storm! It is
blessed to wait, blessed to depend upon Jesus, blessed to believe in his
promise, when all the ways to the fulfilment of that promise seem to be
wholly shut. This is the crowning grace of faith, "against hope to
believe in hope;" and amidst the most desperate circumstances, to cleave
to Jesus as a sure friend, when, in his providences, he appears coming
forth as a determined enemy, and to say, with the same well-grounded
confidence as Job," Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him."</p>

20—Morning—Hebrews 6:19, 20</h3>
<p>"Within the vail, whither the forerunner is for us entered, even
Jesus."—Heb. vi. 19, 20.</p>
<p>Pause over these words, my soul, this morning. Is the vail removed?
Was the vail rent in twain, from the top to the bottom, in the hour that
Christ died? And did Jesus, as thy High Priest, with all his blood, then
enter into 'the place not made with hands, having obtained eternal
redemption for us? Did he enter too as thy forerunner? Pause over this
thought—it is a sweet one. Is Jesus still there? Nay, my soul, look in
and see. He calls thee to look unto him—nay, to follow him, "having
boldness to enter into the holiest by his blood, in the new and living
way which he hath consecrated for us through the vail, that is to say,
his flesh." And what canst thou see there? Within the vail of the Jewish
temple there was the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, and the
golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables
of the covenant; and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the
mercy-seat. But within that vail, whither our forerunner is entered,
look up, my soul, and see Jesus with the golden censer of his own merits
and blood; and not the symbols of the covenant only, but he himself, the
whole of the covenant, God the Father hath given him for the people; not
merely manna, but himself the living bread, the bread of God, of which
whosoever eateth shall live for ever; not the rod of Aaron, but the rod
of his power, to make poor sinners willing in the day of his power; not
the cherubims of glory, but himself the mercy-seat, the propitiatory,
the sacrifice, high priest, and ail in all. Look up, my soul; look in,
my soul; go in, my soul, after him, by faith, and contemplate him as thy
forerunner; and while all thy faculties, in grace and faith, are going
forth in the most lively exercise, hear him say, and let his words sink
deeper and deeper in thine unceasing remembrance: "I only go to prepare
for you a place: I will Come again, and receive you to myself, that
where I am, there you may be also." Hail thou glorious Forerunner, who
art made an high priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

20—Evening—Proverbs 14:14</h3>
<p>"A good man shall be satisfied from himself."—Prov. xiv. 14.</p>
<p>My soul! what is this scripture, and what is the design of the Holy
Ghost in it? Art thou satisfied in thyself? Alas! every day makes me
more and more dissatisfied with myself. How can I, indeed, be satisfied,
who carry about with me such a body of sin and death, which is
everlastingly fighting with, and opposing my better part? What
satisfaction, then, is it, that is here meant? Scripture is best
explained by scripture: hence the satisfaction that a believing soul
finds from himself, is not from his own attaiments, nor his own
righteousness, but from the witness of the Holy Ghost, that he is born
of God, and brought out of nature's darkness into God's marvellous
light. The apostle John hath given, in a single verse, a full
illustration of what the wise man here saith, of a good man (that is, a
child of God) being satisfied with himself: "He that believeth on the
Son of God," saith the apostle John, "hath the witness in himself;" I
John v. 10. Here is the grand source of all his satisfaction. Tile Holy
Ghost witnesseth to the soul of the believer, that he is new born, that
he is passed from death to life; that Jesus is precious, and his
salvation very dear to him. The heart of such an one is brought to know
and feel his own wants by reason of sin, and the infinite suitableness
of Jesus to answer all those wants, and to be to him all he stands in
need of. The poor creature, thus taught of God, is satisfied with the
blessed discovery he hath made of Jesus, and his salvation; and rests
wholly in it, as one perfectly satisfied, and desires no other; yea,
renounceth every other. Hence he is satisfied from himself, and his own
feelings, and not from what others have taught him, that Jesus is all he
needs. My soul! hast thou arrived to this blessedness? If so, praise
that distinguishing grace, by which, in the midst of self-loathing on
account of thy sin, thou hast a self-satisfaction on account of having
found Jesus and his righteousness. Let Jesus have all the praise, and do
thou live as one eternally satisfied with his person and
righteousness.</p>

<p>"Fear not; for they that be with us, are more than they that be with

<p>My soul, never lose sight of this which was shewn to the prophet's
servant in his fright. Though thou seest not, with bodily eyes, the
mountain full of horses and chariots of fire in thy defence; yet with
thy spiritual eyes, thou mayest see, infinitely beyond all this, as
surrounding thee at all times and in all places, God thy Father, with
all his divine attributes and perfections, all engaged, all made over,
all pledged in covenant engagements, in Jesus, for thy defence,
protection, comfort, security, and guiding thee in all things. There is
more in that one assurance than in a thousand worlds, "I will be thy
God"—and all in Jesus, yea and amen. Then, moreover, thou hast God thy
Redeemer with thee, with all his fulness, all his grace, all his
love-his whole heart, his whole soul thine. And thou hast God the Holy
Ghost, with all his influences, gifts, teachings, quickenings,
consolations, strengthenings. All these are with thee; to say nothing of
angels, which are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister unto them
which are heirs of salvation. Surely God's attributes, Jesus's graces,
the Holy Ghost's comforts, being all thine own, and always with thee;
let what armies of men, or legions of evil spirits assault
thee—unbelief, or fear, or doubt, or misgiving; let nothing drive out
the recollections nor remove thy confidence. "Fear not, for they that be
with thee are more than all that can be against thee." Hallelujah.
Amen.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage, that they
cried out, and said, Oh thou man of God, there is death in the pot!"—2
Kings iv. 40.</p>
<p>It was at a time of great famine, that the prophet Elisha ministered
among the sons of the prophets at Gilgal; no wonder, therefore, that
their diet was reduced to a dinner of herbs. During the season of
persecution in our kingdom, somewhat more than a century and half since,
there was a spiritual famine, not of bread or of water, but of hearing
the word of the Lord: and so precious was the word of the Lord in those
days, that our good old fathers used to remark, "bread and water, with
the gospel, was choice fare." We find, in the household of Elisha, that
wild gourds by the ignorance of him that gathered the herbs, were served
up in the pottage of the people, which, as soon as they were discovered,
occasioned the cry to the prophet, "O thou man of God, there is death in
the pot!" And is there not death in the pot, when any matters of a
poisonous quality are mingled and served up to God's people with the
word of his grace? Surely, the springs of all spiritual food and life
are in Jesus: his blood, his righteousness, his finished salvation, the
graces of his Holy Spirit, and the rest and dependence upon God the
Father's covenant love and mercy in him; these are the only food of the
soul by which it can be nourished. To drop these rich and savoury
truths, whereby the soul is kept alive to God, and brought nigh to God
in Christ; or, what is the same thing to mingle, like the wild gourds of
the field, the righteousness of the creature, as being partly the means
of salvation, with this only wholesome food of the soul; may surely
cause the believing soul to cry out, "O thou man of God, there is death
in the pot!" I charge it upon thee, my soul, this evening, in the view
of this scripture, concerning the sons of the prophets, that thou take
heed to receive not mingled things for the good old fare of the gospel.
The smallest introduction to error is as one that letteth out water.
Where the person of Jesus, his work, and glory, are neglected to be set
forth, there will be death in the pot, whatever else be substituted in
the place. A real believer cannot live in his soul's health a day, no
more than a labouring man in his body, where the food suited to each is
not given. And it surely were a pity, when there is such an infinite
fulness in Christ, to substitute any thing for him. See to it then, my
soul, that all thy food be Jesus, and let "all thy fresh springs be in
him." Remember the promise, for in the saddest times of dearth, if Jesus
be looked to, it never can fail: "They shall be abundantly satisfied
with the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the
river of thy pleasures: for with thee is the fountain of life;" Ps.
xxxvi. 8, 9.</p>

22—Morning—John 6:24</h3>
<p>"Seeking for Jesus."—John vi. 24.</p>
<p>This, my soul, should be thy constant employment, wherever thou art,
however engaged; in going in, or out; at rising up, or lying down;
whether in public or private, in the church or market-place; the closet,
the family, the garden, the field, the house: the question ever arising
in the heart should be—where is Jesus? Blessed Spirit! thou glorifier of
my Lord, wilt thou constantly excite this seeking for Jesus in my heart?
Wilt thou, Lord, give me every moment a sense of need, then a view of
his fulness, suitableness, readiness to impart; then bring Him, whom my
soul loveth, and me together; and then open a communication in leading
me forth in desire, and giving me faith to receive from the infinite
fulness of my Lord, and grace for grace? Lord Jesus! I would desire
grace to seek thee, as for hidden treasure. I would seek thee, and thee
only, O my God! I would separate myself from all other things. It is
Jesus, my soul chooseth, my soul needs. I would trust in nothing beside.
No duties, no works; neither prayers nor repentance; no, nor faith
itself, considered as an act of my soul, shall be my comfort, but Jesus
alone I would make my centre; and every thought, and every affection,
and every desire, like so many streams meeting in one, should all pour
themselves, as rivers, into the ocean of thy bosom! And the nearer, as a
stream that draws near the sea is propelled to fall into it, so the more
forcible and vehement let my soul be in desires after thee, as my soul
draweth nearer the hour of seeing thee. Oh Lamb of God, give me to be
seeking after thee through life, pressing after thee from one ordinance
to another; and when ordinances cease, and all outward comforts fail,
then, Lord, may I gather up (as the dying patriarch did his feet in the
bed) all my strength, and pour my whole soul into thine arms, crying
out, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord?"</p>

22—Evening—Revelation 12:1</h3>
<p>"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with
the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars."—Rev. xii. 1.</p>
<p>My soul! as the beloved apostle was invited to see those precious
visions, which the Lord favoured him with, for the church's good, so do
thou, this evening, attend his ministry, and gather, under divine
teaching, instruction from this great wonder, which John saw. Surely,
the woman here spoken of, means the church, the Lamb's wife, clothed in
her husband's righteousness; and the moon, like that planet which
ministers to our world, under her feet: and the crown, with which her
head was adorned, sets forth how the church is made glorious by the
ministry of the twelve apostles in the gospel of salvation: for what can
be more suitable for the church to be crowned with, than the blessed
truths contained in their writings? Now, my soul, as every
representation of the church not only sets forth the whole body at
large, but every individual member of that body, ask thyself, hath this
wonder been wrought on thee, which John saw? Art thou clothed with the
sun, even with Jesus, the sun of righteousness, in his garment of
salvation? Hast thou mounted up, not in airy speculations, not in any
fancied attainments of thine own, but in heavenly mindedness after
Jesus, and devout communion with him; so that the earth, with all its
perishing beauties, is got under thy feet? Hast thou such views of the
blessedness and preciousness of the word of God, the gospel of thy
salvation, that it is dearer to thee than gold, yea, than all the crowns
of the earth? Pause, while these inquiries pass over thy mind; and
surely, if the Lord, by the sovereignty of his grace, hath wrought such
blessed effects upon thee, a great wonder is indeed wrought in earth,
like that which John saw in heaven, and well mayest thou stand amazed at
the greatness and the distinguishing nature of salvation. "Lord! what am
I; and what is my father's house?"</p>

23—Morning—Colossians 4:14</h3>
<p>"The beloved physician."—Coloss. iv. 14.</p>
<p>My soul, catch a thought of what the apostle hero speaks of the
servants to think of the master! If Luke the physician was beloved, how
much more so ought Jesus to be by thee in this sweet character. The Son
of God came, as the great physician of the soul, to heal all that were
diseased, to bind up the brokenheart, to give sight to the blind, to set
at liberty them that are bruised, and to proclaim the acceptable year of
the Lord. My soul, dost thou know Jesus in this tender and affectionate
office? Hath he examined thy case, made thee sensible of thy disease;
and art thou, through his mercy, restored to health? Though, through
shame and fear at the first, you would never have made known your case
to him, had he not first, of his own free accord, called upon you, yet
hath he done so? Have you heard him ask the tender question, "Wilt thou
be made whole?" And have you rejoiced to come under his care? Do you
know what it is to have his blood applied to heal the wounds of sin, his
righteousness to cover them, his grace to refresh under them, and his
name as ointment poured forth, to make a fragrancy from all uncleanness?
Moreover, hath Jesus shewn to thee the freeness of his remedies, without
payment, without money, and without price? And doth he do all this, and
a thousand affectionate offices beside, which belong to the physician,
calling himself by that endearing name, Jehovah Rhophi, I am the Lord
that healeth thee? No longer let it be said, then, "Is there no balm in
Gilead; no physician there?" But tell to every poor sin-sick soul, Jesus
is the beloved physician, who visits the poor and the needy, and heals
all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease among the people, he
hath healed me.</p>

23—Evening—Luke 14:28</h3>
<p>"For which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first,
and counteth the cost?"—Luke xiv. 28.</p>
<p>Ponder, my soul, over this very striking similitude of thy Lord's,
respecting the divine life. The figure of a builder is most aptly
chosen; for the christian builder is building for eternity. And the
figure of a warrior, which our Lord also joins to it, is no less so, for
the battle is for life, and that life is eternal. Hast thou counted the
cost? Hast thou entered upon the work? Is the foundation-stone, which
God hath laid in Zion, the rock on which thou art building? Pause and
examine. Be the cost what it may; the loss of earthly friends; the
parting with every worldly pursuit; the scorn, contempt, and derision of
all mankind; yea, the loss of life itself: if these come in the way of
competition, art thou ready to give them all up?—When thou hast answered
these inquiries, go on, and see that thy foundation be really fixed on
Christ. If so, it must have been previously sought for, by digging deep
into the natural state in which thou wast born. Jesus must have been
first discovered, as most essentially necessary, and most essentially
precious, before the spiritual building of the soul was made to rest
upon him. And, when found, unless the whole of the building rest
entirely upon him, it will, as a column out of its centre, still totter.
Oh! it is blessed to make Christ the all in all of the spiritual temple;
blessed to make him the first in point of order; blessed to make him the
first in point of strength, to support and bear the weight of the whole
building; blessed to make him the grand cement, to unite and keep
together, in one harmonious proportion and regularity, every part of the
building; and blessed to bring forth the top-stone of the building, by
his strength and glory, crying," Grace, grace unto it." Precious Jesus!
may it be found that I have so sat down, counted the cost, and formed my
whole plan, in thy strength, and to thy praise; that whatever
oppositions, like the Tobiahs and Sanballats of old, I may meet with in
the work, I may feel the sweetness and encouragement of that blessed
scripture, and exult with the prophet: "Who art thou, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain!" Zech. iv. 7.</p>

24—Morning—Acts 13:23</h3>
<p>"God, according to his promise, hath raised unto Israel a Saviour,
Jesus."—Acts xiii. 23.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, the blessedness of these words. Jesus is not only
Israel's Saviour, and hath fully answered, in every point, to that
glorious character, but here we are led to discover his credentials.
This is faith's warrant. I believe in Jesus. Why? He brings with him the
name, the authority, the commission of God the Father. Jesus is the
appointment, the ordinance, the method Jehovah hath sent forth for
salvation. Sweet thought! So that, added to all that I behold in the
Lord Jesus, adapted to my case and circumstances, [ here see that Jesus
as the Father's gift, the Father's sent, the Father's anointed, full of
grace and truth. Jesus is therefore the great promise of the bible; for
in him are folded up and contained all the promises. And I see also,
that God our Father was, and is, the great promiser. And I see that God
not only gave this rich Saviour to poor sinners, but, according to his
promise, raised him up also from the dead, when he had made his soul an
offering for sin, to bless them: for it is said, "that he was delivered
for our offences, and raised again for our justification." My soul,
pause over this blessed account, and look for thine own interest in it.
If God hath raised up to Israel this Saviour, what knowest thou of him?
Has thou felt thy need of a Saviour? Dost thou accept the Father's
Saviour? Is Jesus thy Saviour? Art thou come to him for salvation? Now
God the Father hath raised him up, doth he appear to thee in all his
beauties, fulness, suitableness, and complete salvation?</p>

24—Evening—1 Kings 3:5</h3>
<p>"And God said, ask what I shall give thee?"—1 Kings iii. 5.</p>
<p>My honoured Lord! may I not, with all humbleness of soul, apply what
was here said to Solomon, in the old testament dispensation, as said to
all thy redeemed under the new testament grace? Didst thou not say,
Lord! "whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it
you. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; ask and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full?" John xvi. 23, 24. I feel encouraged
by this saying of my Lord; and I am come up, this evening, to my Lord,
to get large supplies of grace, mercy, pardon, peace; yea, Christ
himself, with all his gifts, with all his fulness, and all his
blessings. And sure I am, if my Lord will give me as large a hand to
receive, as my Lord's hand is to give, I shall have a blessed time of it
this evening. My soul, look to it, that thou take with thee all thy
wants; yea, come as empty as the poorest beggar that ever appeared in
the poverty and wretchedness of a fallen nature; for he that gives,"
gives liberally, and upbraideth not." And knowest thou what thy wants
are; and what the wants of Christ's church upon earth are, and thine
household, thy family, thy children, thy friends? Let them tell thee, if
thou dost not know; for say unto them, Jesus is upon the throne, and
delighting to give oat of his inexhaustible fulness; and there is an
assurance of blessings, if asked in faith. 'Fell them that thou wilt
faithfully lay their cases before him; yea, bring them with thee, and
let ail unite in prayer and supplication together, that every want may
be supplied, and every poor sinner's heart made glad! Oh! what
encouragement it is to consider, that every thing in Christ is for his
people, and that he waits to be gracious, and delights in imparting
blessings. The Father's gift of Christ is to this express purpose; for
he so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; and therefore,
with him, "he will freely give all things." And Jesus, who gave himself
for his people, will surely give every thing that can be needed to his
people. And it is the glory, grace, and love of the Holy Ghost, to give
to the people views and enjoyments of both the Father's love and the
Son's grace. Hear then, my soul, the voice from the mercy-seat, this
evening, "ask what I shall give thee?" And see that thy petition, and
the blessings thou prayest for, be great and large, suited to the glory
of the great Giver, and the largeness and tenderness of the Lord's
heart. And do mark this down, as an encouragement to take with thee, of
the assurance of thy success: if he that bids thee ask, gives thee faith
at the same time to believe; and if, while the Lord is stretching forth
the sceptre of his grace, he enables thee to stretch forth thy withered
hand to touch it; sure 1 am, that thou wilt not come empty away; for he
hath said, "all things that ye ask believing, ye shall receive."</p>

25—Morning—Revelation 22:3, 4</h3>
<p>"His servants shall serve him. And they shall see his face; and his
name shall be in their foreheads."—Rev. xxii. 3, 4.</p>
<p>Mark these characters, my soul. Jesus hath servants, and they are
distinguished from the world. They "serve him." What is it to serve
Christ? The prophet hath described. Free grace hath made them servants,
in bringing them from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the sons of God; and therefore he saith, in the Lord's name,"
My servants shah eat, but ye shall be hungry; my servants shall drink,
but ye shall be thirsty; my servants shah rejoice, but ye shall be
ashamed; my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for
sorrow of heart." How distinguishing these characters! God's servants
have the table of Jesus to sit down to; the bread of life, the bread of
God, the living bread, which is Jesus himself, to feed upon. They shall
drink also; for he that is their living bread is their living water
also—even the water of life, of which whosoever drinketh shall thirst no
more; "but it shall be in him a well of water, springing up into
everlasting life." The servants of the Lord shall rejoice, and sing for
joy of heart also. Yes, "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." Neither is this
all. The servants of the Lord shall "see his face." They do now, by
faith in his word, in his ordinances, in his manifestations, visits,
grace, providences. And, by and by, when this vail of covering, cast
over all people, is totally taken down and removed at death, they shall
have a glorious view of the King in his beauty by sight. Moreover, his
name is said to be" in their foreheads." Yes, it is so; the image of
Christ is impressed upon them, as" Holiness to the Lord" was engraven on
the mitre of Aaron. "Beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord,
they are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
Spirit of the Lord." My soul, what sayest thou to these evidences? Are
they thine? Canst thou take the comfort of them to thyself.</p>

25—Evening—Acts 16:13</h3>
<p>"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river-side, where
prayer was wont to be made."—Acts xvi. 13.</p>
<p>What, had they no church, no synagogue, no prayerhouse, in the city?
Was it like another Athens, wholly given to idolatry? My soul, think of
thy privileges, and learn rightly to prize them, and use them to the
glory of the great Giver. It was" on the sabbath." What a mercy to poor
fallen man is the sabbath? And yet what multitudes slight, despise, and
never profit by it! My soul! think again, in this view also, of thy
mercies; and bow down to the dust in the deepest humiliation of soul and
body, that the sabbath is precious to thee. "Who made thee to differ
from another?" By and by thou wilt enter into the everlasting sabbath of
heaven. There is somewhat very interesting in what the apostle here
saith of going out" by a river side." Probably it was in the
recollection of the church, that in Babylon, where the people were
captives, the Lord made the river Chebar famous for visions to one
prophet, and Hiddekel to another. But, blessed be God! though our land
is so sinful, we are not given up to captivity; and while many of the
nations around have their churches turned into stables, amidst the din
and horrors of war, our candlestick is not yet removed out of its place.
Precious Jesus! wherever prayer is wont to be made by thy people, let my
soul delight to be found. Let me hear thy voice inviting to communion:
"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon." Yea, Lord,
I would follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. I would follow thee to
the assemblies of thy people. I would wait to see the goings of my God
and King in his sanctuary. I would have my whole soul athirst for thee,
as the hart for the cooling streams. And while I join thy people in the
great congregation, where prayer is wont to be made, I pray thy grace,
and the influences of thy blessed Spirit, to fire my soul with
foretastes of that glorious assembly, which are keeping an eternal
sabbath above, where the everlasting praises of God and of the Lamb will
engage and fill my raptured soul with joy unspeakable and full of glory
to all eternity.</p>

26—Morning—Acts 3:13</h3>
<p>"The God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus."—Acts iii.
13.</p>
<p>See, my soul, how every part and portion of scripture is directed to
this one subject—to glorify the Lord Jesus. What is the very design of
redemption but to glorify the Lord Jesus? What hath God constituted a
church for, but to glorify the Lord Jesus? To what do all the precepts,
promises, ordinances, sacrifices under the law, and institutions under
the gospel, minister, but to this one end—to glorify the Lord Jesus?
Talk they of promises? Why, all the promises of God are "in Christ
Jesus, yea and amen, to the glory of God the. Father by us." Talk they
of the law? "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth." Talk they of commandments? "This is the commandment,
that ye believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God; and that
believing, ye might have life through his name." And how hath the God of
our fathers glorified his Son Jesus, in giving him as a covenant to the
people. Hath he not constituted him the glorious Head, the Mediator, the
Husband, the Lord, the Prophet, the Priest, the King of his people? How
hath he glorified him in his person, offices, characters, relations! How
hath he carried him through all the parts of redemption, in his
incarnation, ministry, miracles, obedience, life, death, resurrection,
ascension; and in all his triumphs over sin and Satan, death, hell, and
the grave. And having constituted him the universal and eternal Lord of
all, commands that "every knee should bow before him, and every tongue
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father ]" And
is there any thing left, by which the God of our fathers might manifest
that he hath glorified his Son Jesus? Yes, there is one thing more, my
soul, by which the wonderful grace is shewn; and that is, when the God
of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus in the heart of every poor
sinner, who gives the glory of his salvation fully, heartily, completely
to him, and puts the crown of redemption upon the head of Jesus. My
soul, hast thou done this? Hast thou glorified Jesus in this way, the
only way in which thou canst glorify him, and the Father in him? Then,
if so, what a sweet thought is it, that the God of our fathers, and
thou, a poor sinner, are both agreed in this one blessed work, to
glorify Jesus. And here both meet in the only possible meeting-place for
an holy God and unholy men to meet; and both are engaged in one and the
same deed—to glorify Jesus! Oh thou Lamb of God, be thou eternally
glorified in my salvation!</p>

<p>"And all king Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the
vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold, none
were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."—I
Kings x. 21.</p>
<p>Behold, my soul! the splendour of Solomon, and figure to thyself what
a court and people his must have been, with whom silver was as nothing;
and then turn thy thoughts to Jesus, and ask thyself, whether it be
possible to suppose that he, with whom are hid all "the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge," can be otherwise than rich himself, and
abundantly gracious to enrich his people? Thy Solomon, thy Jesus, hath
all things, and all things richly to dispense. He is the universal Lord
and proprietor of all. In him dwelleth all fulness; "yea, durable riches
and righteousness." And what endears Jesus, and marks the superiority of
his kingdom is, that every thing in it is everlasting. Solomon's
splendour was great, but it was limited to the period of his fife; yea,
less than life. But Jesus is everlasting; the riches and the blessings
he hath, and which he gives, are everlasting. Jesus maketh both gold and
silver, yea, the riches of grace and wisdom, as the stones of the street
for abundance; and their blessedness is, like him, eternal. So that here
we find an eternity of blessings. All beside is hollow, transitory,
fading. But with Jesus it is solid and substantial. "I will cause them,"
he saith, "that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill their
treasure." Precious Lord! may I never contemplate earthly pageantry,
without taking into the view thy glory; and while I behold human
grandeur, however splendid, or however shining, which is but for the
day, may my soul hasten to the consideration of thy glory, which is a
portion for thy redeemed to live upon to all eternity!</p>

<p>"I have exalted one chosen out of the people."—Ps. lxxxix. 19.</p>
<p>My soul, wert thou refreshed on the past day with the precious
meditation of the God of our fathers glorifying his Son Jesus? Suffer
not, then, the blessed subject to pass away from thy thoughts this day,
or any day, but look at the same delightful meditation proposed in the
words which God spake to his Holy One in vision—"I have exalted one
chosen out of the people." Yes, the Lord Jesus, as man and Mediator, was
chosen in the infinite mind of Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
from everlasting. And before that God went forth in the immediate acts
of creation, when that vast mass of beings the Lord determined to call
into existence arose in his own infinite mind at his command, this
blessed one, this glorious, this distinguished, this precious individual
which was to become one with the uncreated Word, in order to constitute
the Wisdom-man, Mediator, was from everlasting chosen. This was the
glorious act—this was the great appointment. Then Christ Jesus, our
glorious Head, our Surety, Redeemer, Saviour, was then set up from
everlasting! And my soul, hadst thou been present, had there been a
possibility of such a thing, had the whole church been there, would not
every heart, every soul of his redeemed, have shouted aloud in the
contemplation of such a Saviour, and cried out, "He is the altogether
lovely, the chiefest among ten thousand!" Precious Jesus, thou art
indeed lovely in thyself, lovely in thy cross, lovely in thy crown,
lovely in all thy gracious acts, victories, triumphs, grace, and mercy.
Every thing in thee is lovely; and thou communicatest loveliness to all
thy people. Thou hast chosen our inheritance for us; reign and rule over
us, and in us; for thou art "The Lord our righteousness."</p>

<p>"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean;
from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse
you."—Ezek. xxxvi. 25.</p>
<p>Was there ever a more precious scripture? And was there ever a poor
sinner needed it more than thou, my soul? And what a thousand beauties
are contained in it? Who is the great promiser, but the Lord Jehovah,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation? And what is the
clean water here spoken of, but the blood of Christ? Christ, with all
his redemption, all his fulness, all his suitableness, and his
all-sufficiency? And what doth this sweet promise imply? Every thing, in
one, is folded up in it. It is all of God; all in himself, and all to be
wrought by himself. He provides the clean water; he cleanseth the
sinners; he sprinkles, he applies, he promiseth the sure efficacy; for
they "shall be clean;" and he makes the blessings most comprehensive,
and full, and complete; for it shall be a cleansing from all their
filthiness, and from all their idols. See then, my soul, what a portion
thou hast here found, in the word of God's grace, for thine evening's
meditation! Evening, did I say? yea, for the meditation of thy whole
life, and to form the foundation of a song of praise to all eternity!
Here is every thing in it thou canst possibly need, to encourage thee to
come for cleansing, under all thy pollutions, in thy daily walk through
life. Here is God the Father fully engaged, and as fully promising. Here
is Jesus, in his blood of sprinkling, as the Father's gift for
cleansing, in all his divine offices and suited mercy. And here is the
purity wrought by the Holy Ghost, in his gracious application of the
whole; and which he doth most graciously and most fully testify, when he
shews thee thy need, and the suitableness of Jesus, and inclines thee to
believe the efficacy of this blood of Christ to cleanse from all sin.
Now, my soul, muse over the blessedness and fulness of this sweet
scripture, and see how suited it is, in every point, to thy wants, and
to thy Lord's glory. And when thou hast gathered from it, like the bee
from the flower, all the honey it contains, take it home to thy inmost
affections, as the bee doth what he gathers to the hive, and live upon
it for thy daily food. The promise is absolute; for God saith, "I will
do it." And the certainty of its effect is as fixed; for God saith, "Ye
shall be clean." And the extent of it is as sure; for God saith, "From
all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you." My
soul, ask the most daring heart of unbelief, what shall arise to unsay
what God hath said, or to counteract what God hath promised?</p>

<p>"The creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen."—2
Kings iv. 1.</p>
<p>My soul, how doth this affect thee? Art thou in debt? By nature and
by practice thou wast miserably so, unless the debt be cancelled. As a
creature, and as a sinful creature, thou art in thyself for ever
insolvent. Thou hast nothing to pay, and art shut up in a total
impossibility ever to pay. And how much owest thou unto my Lord? Alas,
my soul, thou owest millions of debts to thy Almighty Creditor. The law
thou hast broken; justice demands retribution; conscience condemns;
Satan accuses; and the creditor is come to take not thy two sons only,
but both thy two parts, soul and body, to the prison of death and hell,
unless some almighty Surety hath stept in and paid the dreadful debt,
that thou mayest be free. At death, and at judgment that follows, the
everlasting release, or the everlasting imprisonment, will take place.
And who knows whether the decision may not be to-morrow? nay, whether
the same sentence as went forth to the rich man in the gospel, is not
already gone forth concerning thee—" This night thy soul shall be
required of thee!" Pause, my soul! Is it not high time to flee to the
prophet, even the Prince of the prophets, the Lord Jesus, to tell him
thy case, and to seek his deliverance? Hark, doth he say, as the prophet
did to the poor woman, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me what hast thou
in the house?" Is not Jesus with thee? Is not his fulness suited to thy
emptiness? Hast thou him with thee in the house? Shut then the door;
bring, bring, my soul, all thy empty vessels-Jesus will fill them all.
Nor will his bounty stay until that all thy vessels be filled; nay,
every vessel will fail, before that his grace fails. And when thou art
full of Jesus, live on Jesus, and see that Jesus hath paid thy Almighty
Creditor, and left enough for thee to live on for ever. Oh the rapture
and the joy, when the Almighty Creditor comes, at midnight, or at
cock-crowing, or in the morning, to know the dreadful debt is paid, and
to hear him say, "Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found
a ransom."</p>

28—Evening—John 14:24</h3>
<p>"The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent
me."—John xiv. 24.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever fully and thoroughly considered that sweet
and precious teaching of thy Lord, which, as Mediator, when upon earth,
in all his discourses and conversations with his disciples, he was
perpetually shewing them? I mean, that all he was, and all he had; and
all he dispensed, were the blessings and gifts of his Father, in him, to
his people. If thou hast been meditating upon this most blessed point of
the gospel ever so fully and closely, it will still afford new glories
for every renewed attention to it; and therefore, sit down this
delightful summer's evening, and take another view of it. Jesus comes to
his people in his Father's name, and he saith in this charming
scripture, that his very words are not his, but the Father's; so much of
the heart of the Father is in Christ, and in all of Christ, in all he
saith, and in all he hath done. So that what is Jesus doing, in all his
ministry upon earth, yea, in all his sovereignty now in heaven, but
shewing to his redeemed, the Father, and the Father's love, and grace,
and mercy, towards his people in him? Did he not then come forth from
the bosom of the Father full of grace and truth, as if to unfold to us
what passed in the heart of the Father, of love and mercy towards his
people, in the wonders of redemption? And is not Jesus now, in every
renewed manifestation, teaching his redeemed the same? If all that the
Father hath are our Jesus's, and all the fulness of the Godhead bodily
dwelleth in him; surely we ought never to receive any of his good and
blessed gifts without acknowledging the Father's love in them. And would
not this make every blessing doubly sweet and increasingly precious? If
Jesus himself be the gift of the Father, shah I not enjoy the Father in
all that Jesus bestows? And as I can have no immediate communion with
the Father but by him, will not the mercies gather a blessedness, and a
value, in coming to my poor soul through Jesus's hands, as the bountiful
dispenser of them? Yea, shah I not find a savour, which otherwise could
never have been known, in receiving them in and from Jesus; convinced,
as I am, that none cometh to the Father, but by him; and but for his
opening a new and living way by his blood, never should I have known the
Father's love, or the Redeemer's grace? Dear Lord Jesus! do thou give
me, by thy blessed Spirit, ever to keep in remembrance these most
precious things. So shall I truly enjoy both thy person and thy gifts.
And then I shall not, like the apostle, pray for a sight of the Father
distinct from thee; for I shall then be perfectly satisfied and
convinced, that in seeing thee, I see the Father also; and from
henceforth, that I know him, and have seen him. "Thanks be unto God for
his unspeakable gift."</p>

29—Morning—John 14:9</h3>
<p>"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known
me?"—John xiv. 9.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this question of the Lord Jesus which he put to
Philip—figure to thyself that the Lord saith the same to thee; and now
see what answer thou wilt give him. It is a great question: and if thou
art able to answer it with a—"Yea, Lord;" and from the blessed Spirit's
teaching thou truly knowest Jesus to be what the scripture saith he is,
and canst as truly, from the receiving that testimony which God hath
given of his dear and ever-blessed Son, set to thy seal that God is
true; then art thou truly happy, and mayest humbly take to thyself a
portion in that blessedness which the Lord Jesus pronounced upon Peter,
from the same grace manifested: "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it
unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." Pause then, and inquire:
dost thou know who Christ is? Art thou perfectly satisfied, my soul, of
the oneness in nature, in essence, in glory, in will, in worship, in
work, in design, in attributes, perfections, power, sovereignty; in
short, in all and every thing which constitutes the Godhead between the
Father, and the Son, and the Spirit? Oh yes, my soul cries out, I do,
through the teaching of my God, most firmly, heartily, and cordially
believe, that Jesus is one with the Father over all, God blessed for
ever! Amen. Pause again, my soul, and say, dost thou as firmly and
heartily believe that thy Jesus, who, in the divine nature, is one with
the Father, is no less in the human nature, which he united to the
Godhead for the purposes of salvation, one with thee, bone of thy bone,
and flesh of thy flesh? Doth this make an equal article in thy creed? Oh
yes, I am, through the same divine teaching, as fully and perfectly
convinced that he who is and was, and ever will be, the uncreated Word,
was made flesh, and thereby became the true Immanuel, God with us, God
in our nature. Pause, once more, my soul, and say, dost thou believe
that, by this union of God and man, Jesus became the true, the only, the
blessed Mediator, the Christ of God, the Sent of God, the Sealed of God,
the Anointed of God, the Lamb of God, the Word of God, the Wisdom of
God, and the power of God for salvation to every one that believeth? Bow
down, my soul, with unceasing thanksgivings and praise to the Author and
Giver of faith, for the stupendous discoveries he hath made to thee of
himself, while thou criest out in transports of rejoicing—Lord, all this
I believe; and am perfectly satisfied that thou art one with the Father,
and art in the Father, and the Father in thee. And while thou thus
givest in thy testimony of the Lord Jesus, wilt thou not, my soul, at
the same time, under a conscious sense of the distinguishing mercy, cry
out also with the astonished disciple—"Lord, how is it that thou hast
thus manifested thyself unto me, and not unto the world."</p>

29—Evening—Isaiah 45:11</h3>
<p>"Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, ask me
of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my
hands command ye me."—Isa. xlv. 11.</p>
<p>Nothing can give a higher proof of the love of God, than what the
scriptures reveal concerning him. He opened a way of access to himself,
when man by sin had lost the way; and in his dear Son he has made every
provision for bringing us nigh by his blood. The throne of grace he hath
opened for their approach; the assurance he hath given of accepting them
in the beloved; the very tender and kind expressions which issue from
the throne; and the answers which have been given to thousands, and are
continually given to thousands who come there; yea, the promises with
which they are surrounded, that" before they call, he will answer, and
while they are speaking, he will hear:" all these are full of
endearments, to shew forth the love of God in Jesus Christ to all his
people. But still, if possible, beyond all these, this portion from the
writings of the prophet is most wonderful, and is confirmed by Jehovah's
own saying," Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
the work of my hands command ye me." What! doth the Lord indeed allow
himself to be commanded? Hath he thrown, as it were, the reins of
government into the hands of his people; and, if the object of their
petition be for his glory and their welfare, may they command him? My
soul! what an astonishing, what an unparalleled instance of
condescension is this!—But are there any instances upon record of the
kind? Yes! When Jacob wrestled with God in prayer, he boldly told the
Lord, that he would not let him go without a blessing: and the blessing
he had. And God himself, a thousand years after, noted it down by the
prophet, that" by his strength, he had power with God," Gen. xxxii. 26,
28. Hosea xii. 3, 4. When Joshua was pursuing the enemies of God, and of
his Christ, he bade the sun stand still; and it did so; Joshua x. 12-14.
When the Lord Jesus went with the disciples to Emmaus, and they
constrained him to abide, he was entreated of them, and went in with
them; Luke xxiv. 29. And who shall say, what instances of wonder, grace,
and love, in a thousand and ten thousand cases, both public and private,
in the history of the church and the Lord's people, have been
accomplished, of the same kind, and are every day going on in their
experiences? My soul! look at Moses, stopping the Lord's hand, when
coming forth to destroy Israel; Exod. xxxii. 9-14. Look how Elias shut
up, and again opened, the windows of heaven, by the prevalency of
prayer; and read the apostle's comment upon it; 1 Kings xvii. 1. James
v. 16-18. And when thou hast duly pondered the wonderful subject, say,
what is there thy God and Father can or will deny thee, when thou comest
to him in the name, and blood, and intercession of his dear and ever
blessed Son? Read the inscription on his cross, in connection with this
blessed scripture of the prophet, and then say, with the apostle: "He
that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall
he rot with him freely give us all things?" Romans viii. 32.</p>

30—Morning—Deuteronomy 15:15</h3>
<p>"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee."—Deut. xv. 15.</p>
<p>Say, my soul, canst thou ever forget the wormwood and the gall of
that state of nature, from which the Lord thy God brought thee? Figure
to thyself the most horrid state of captivity which the world ever knew;
and what could the whole be, bounded, as it must be, by the short period
of human life, compared to the everlasting vassalage of sin and Satan,
in which thou didst lay when Jesus passed by and brought thee out? No
galley-slave, chained to the oar, could equal thy misery, bound with the
chain of sin. No duration of misery, bounded by time, equals that
endless state of woe to which thou wast exposed. Thou weft a bondman to
the power of sin, to the love of sin, to the desire of sin, to the
punishment of sin; a bondman to the law of God, to the justice of God,
to the displeasure of God, to the threatenings of God; a bondman to
thine own guilty conscience; a bondman to thine own corrupt lusts, not
one lust, but many, serving, as the apostle saith, "divers lusts and
pleasures, hateful, and hating one another;" a bondman to Satan, a
willing drudge, wearing his livery, delighted in his service, though
full of sorrow, vexation, and disappointment, and his wages sure death;
a bondman to the fear of many creatures among the inferior creation,
many of whom had continual power to vex and distress thee; a bondman to
the fear of death, hell, and a judgment to come! Was this thy state, .my
soul, by nature and by practice? And hath one like the Son of Man
brought thee out? Precious Jesus, what shall I say to thee, what shall I
say for thee? What shall I render to the Lord for all the mercies he
hath done to me, and for me? And dost thou say, Lord, that I may
remember that bondage and thy redemption! Oh may my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth, if I forget thee, thou Author of all my joy, and all
my happiness! Nay, if I do not remember thee, and prefer thy love more
than wine. In life, in death, and to all eternity, may my soul hang upon
thee, as the bee upon the flower; and let the fragrancy of thy name be
as ointment poured forth.</p>

30—Evening—Song of Solomon 6:13</h3>
<p>"Return, return, O Shulamite, return, return, that we may look upon
thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
armies."—Song vi. 13.</p>
<p>It is the church that is here called upon to return, and most likely
by the daughters of Jerusalem. Some have thought the church is so
called, as being of Salem, or Shulem, the shortened word for Jeru-salem.
And some have thought that Salem is the same with Solomon, as the
feminine of Solomon, the wife. And others have supposed, that as
Jerusalem means peace, the church is called so, on account of her
loveliness. And no doubt, in each sense, the church may well be called
so, being married to Christ; being of the "Jerusalem that is above,
which is the mother of us all;" and being beautiful, peaceful, and
lovely in Jesus, as Jerusalem is the praise of the whole earth, Psalm
xlviii. 9. But wherefore is the Shulamite called upon to return, to be
looked upon, and with such earnestness, as to cause the request to be so
often repeated? The answer is very plain. If it be the inquiry
immediately on a soul's conversion, the change from death to life, from
sin to salvation, is so great, that every one may be supposed anxious to
behold. If it be the return of the poor believer, after a state of
backsliding, the blushing face of a poor soul might also be well
considered as a grateful sight to all that love to behold the blessed
fruits of the Holy Ghost. And if it be in the after-stages of a life of
grace, when a believer, from long knowing Jesus, and long living upon
him, is become most beautiful and comely in his profession, no object
upon earth can be an equal object of delight, or more worthy universal
attention. So that in either sense, the earnest and repeated call for
her return, to be looked upon, may be well accounted for. And the
church's answer is equally engaging. What would you see in me? As if she
bad said," In my best and highest attainment, I am but a poor creature
in myself. All my beauty is derived from Jesus. I am indeed comely in
him; and he is my glory, and the lifter-up of my head. But in myself I
am no other but as one contending with two armies. I feel corruption
rising continually against grace; and" when I would do good, evil is
present with me."' My soul! is not this thy very state? Art thou not
perpetually exercised in this struggle? Precious Lord Jesus! let this
view of thy church comfort me in a consciousness of a family likeness.
And Oh, Lord! while I thus groan under the remains of indwelling
corruption, give me to see that they are but remains. Jesus will at
length, and by little and little, drive these Canaanites out of the
land.</p>

31—Morning—John 9:25</h3>
<p>"One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."—John ix.
25.</p>
<p>This is a great thing to say, my soul: on what foundation dost thou
rest this knowledge? If the Lord Jesus hath opened thine eyes, then
indeed thou canst not but discover thy former blindness; for during that
state of nature thou literally couldst discern nothing. And if thy
former blindness be discovered, then thy present sight hath brought thee
acquainted with new objects. Pause over the review of both this morning.
Tile blindness of nature to spiritual things is marked in scripture in
strong characters. A poor blind sinner sees nothing of the light of
life. The Sun of Righteousness is not risen upon him. He discerns
nothing of the love of God in Christ. If he reads the scripture, the
vail is upon his heart. If he hears of Jesus, he sees no beauty in him.
Nothing is nearer to him than the Lord, and nothing further from his
thoughts. To tell him of the sweetness of the word of God, is strange to
him; for he tastes nothing of sweetness in it. To tell him of the
loveliness of ordinances and the sabbaths; these are strange things in
his esteem. My soul, if indeed thine eyes be opened, thou wilt know that
thou wast once indeed blind, in the fullest sense of the word, to all
these delightful views of sacred things, which now are thy supreme
pleasure and thy joy. Say, then, what hast thou seen to justify this
saying: "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see?" Hast
thou seen the king in his beauty? Hast thou seen with the eye of faith
the glories of Jesus? Yes, if so be all other objects are obscured. The
sight of Jesus, as the Christ of God, hath darkened the glory and
excellency of all beside, Jesus, as he is in himself, as he is in his
offices, characters, relations; as he is to thee and thy happiness; is
the one, the only one thing needful; and thou must count all things but
dung and dross to win Christ. These, my soul, are blessed tokens that
Jesus hath opened thine eyes, and brought thee out of darkness into his
marvellous light. By and by thou shalt see him as he is, and dwell with
him for ever.</p>

31—Evening—Joshua 7:8, 9</h3>
<p>"O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before
their enemies? For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land
shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from
the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?"—Joshua vii. 8,
9.</p>
<p>My soul, learn a most blessed lesson here, such as will be an
unanswerable argument for thee at all times, and upon all occasions, to
make use of at a mercy-seat, and among the strongest pleas in prayer.
Israel had sinned, and had fallen before the enemy in consequence of it.
Joshua confesseth that all that was come upon Israel was just, and had
that been all the event included in Israel's destruction, it would have
been no more than what was right. But God had promised to bring Israel
into Canaan; and therefore the honour of God was concerned that this
should be accomplished. Now, saith Joshua, if for our sins thou
sufferest us to fall before our enemies, what will the nations of the
earth say of it? How will the promise be fulfilled, and thy faithfulness
and honour be secured? "O Lord, what shall I say? What wilt thou do unto
thy great name?" Pause, my soul, and apply the sweet truth. God will
magnify his name above all his word. He saith himself, "I wrought for my
name's sake, that the land should not be polluted before the heathen, in
whose sight they dwelt." And the Lord repeats it three times, to the
same purpose, in one chapter, Ezek. xx. 9, 14, 22. Now, my soul, under
all thy straights and difficulties, do thou adopt the plan of Joshua,
and be assured that this is the great argument to ensure success. His
name is engaged in and to Jesus, to give him to see the travail of his
soul, now he hath made his soul an offering for sin, and to be
satisfied. Hence, therefore, the name of Jehovah is pledged to this.
"Once have I sworn," he saith, "by my holiness, that I will not lie unto
David;" Psalm lxxxix. 35. Every believer in Christ should be for ever
pleading this in the blood and righteousness of Jesus. Dost thou want
pardon? Ask it for his name's sake. Dost thou want grace? Here again let
the Lord's name's sake be the plea. To interest the name of the Lord in
every petition, is the sure way to obtain it. To plead duties, or
ordinances, or, in short, any thing but Jesus, and God the Father's
covenant engagements to Jesus, is to go off the ground. No reason, or
shadow of a reason can be found, but God's own name, and this engaged in
a way of redemption by Jesus, wherefore the Lord should be merciful to
pardon and bless a poor sinner. Do not forget this, but for ever plead
with the Lord for his name's sake, and for his glory in Christ; and the
event will surely be that Jehovah must work, and, as he hath said
himself, have pity for his holy name, "that it be not profaned among the
heathen:" and answer thy petition for grace. And Oh! how blessed that
scripture in which the Lord sums up and confirms the whole, on this one
account: "Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known
unto you: be ashamed, and confounded for your own ways, O house of
Israel;" Ezekiel xxxvi. 22, 32.</p>

enabled thee to begin some that are past, in taking the name of Jesus
for thy theme. Let his name be as ointment poured forth, whose fragrancy
shall make thee strong, as it made the poor man whole. And as the Lord
hath opened a new month to thee in grace, do thou take up his name,
through faith in his name, in praise and prayer. And see to it, my soul,
that through the month, and indeed the whole of life, improve his name
in every case, in every want, in every need. Depend upon it, his name
will answer all. Whatever thy necessities are, in Jesus's name there is
a supply for all. Art thou poor, he is rich: sick, he is thy health;
weak, he is strong; sinful, he is the Lord thy righteousness. Every
thing, and in every way, upon all accounts, and upon all occasions—his
name, through faith in his name, is the universal charm, the everlasting
remedy, supply, comfort, strength of all. Jesus hath every thing, and
all things; and he hath them all for his people. Oh then, my soul, look
to Him and his name, for the suited grace in every time of need! He
will, as the Psalmist sweetly reasons—he will, nevertheless,
(notwithstanding all thy undeservings, this </span><span

<p>"Say not ye, there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for
they are white already to harvest."—John iv. 35.</p>
<p>My soul, the month hath opened most graciously; the season of the
year is very interesting; all the reapers of the fruits of the earth are
now busy in the fields to gather in the food that perisheth. Oh! let it
never be said of thee," The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and
thou art not saved!" Jerem. viii. 20. Pause, my soul, over the sweet
words of Jesus, in the evening and cool of the day, and consider their
import. As in nature there is a seed time and harvest, so is there in
grace. And we are told, that the Lord hath given "the appointed weeks of
harvest." 'At what season dost thou now stand? Surely, thou art advanced
to the time of ripening. How wilt thou discover this? Is there not a
similarity here also between nature and grace? As the ripened corn
becomes more full and ponderous, and golden and weighty, and, in
proportion to ripeness, bends nearer to the earth; so the child of God,
the better he is prepared for the garner of heaven, the more is he
filled with spiritual attainments; becoming lower in his own eyes, and
Jesus increasingly precious and exalted. And when the Lord gives the
signal for his harvest-time, he cometh to the grave "like a shock of
corn in full season." Precious Lord of the harvest! I beseech thee,
carry on thy work in my heart, and let thy kingdom there be as thou hast
described it, where the good seed is cast into the ground, and it
springeth up and groweth, men know not how. Oh! prepare me for the
harvest, that when, at thy command, the angel of death shall put in the
sickle, I may be gathered to thy garner in heaven! Amen.</p>

<p>"The Lord, the God of Hosts, shall be with you, as ye have

<p>My soul, pause over this precious scripture, and ask thyself, is it
indeed confirmed to thy experience? And do remark how the promise of the
old testament scripture is confirmed in the new. Jesus assured the same,
when he said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father
will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him." Pause, my
soul, again, and see whether both testaments concurring in the same, and
the Holy Ghost ever abiding with the Lord's people, to confirm his word
in the heart; are not these promises thine, and art thou not
everlastingly enjoying them? Precious Jesus, morning by morning would I
besiege thy mercy-seat, to put thee in mind of this promise, which in
this blessedness, comprehends every other. If the Lord, the God of
Hosts, be with me; if the Father graciously come; if the Son himself
come, both to make their abode, not as a wayfaring man that turneth in
to tarry for a night, but to make their abode; and if the Holy Ghost
abide with me for ever—Oh the blessedness of such a state, the glory of
such company! Lord, I pray, be it unto me according to thy word.</p>

the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards, let us see if the
vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud
forth: there will I give thee my loves."—Song vii. 11, 12.</p>
<p>My soul! wilt thou do as the church here hath done, and invite Jesus
to come with thee into retirement, to enjoy sweet fellowship and
communion, and to tell him how exceedingly thou lovest him, or desirest
so to do? Jesus invites thee repeatedly to this, and why shouldest not
thou invite him? It is blessed to catch the gracious words of thy Lord
from his mouth, and to say to him what he first saith to thee. See Isa.
xxvi. 20. Song ii. 10. Matt. xi. 28. Rev. xxii. 17. And where wouldest
thou have thy Lord to go with thee? Surely thou wilt say, to the field
of his own scriptures, and to the villages of his own people, and to the
vineyards of his own church; that Jesus may open to thee his own blessed
word, and that thou mayest not barely visit, with Jesus, his people, but
lie down with him, and he with thee, and arise early to visit the
vineyards of his church, as the blessed place, where his honour
dwelleth. And what is thy motive for this divine society with thy Lord?
Is it not to take delight in Jesus, and in all that concerns him? His
vine is his church, Isa. v. 7. And Oh! how refreshing is it to thee, to
behold the church of Jesus flourishing in the earth? How truly blessed
to behold the first dawnings of grace in young believers, which are not
unlike the appearance of the tender grape; and the more confirmed faith
of old saints, which the buddings of the strong fruit of the pomegranate
shadow forth. Is this thy motive, and dost thou really, truly, and
heartily invite thy honoured Lord to this communion? And wilt thou there
shew him thy loves, and tell him how truly lovely and truly loving he
is; that" his love is better than wine;" and that thou desirest to love
him, who hath first loved thee; and that thou longest to see more, and
to know more of that love of Jesus, "which passeth knowledge, that thou
mayest be filled with all the fulness of God?"—If these be thy longings,
and thou communicatest them to Jesus, he will be found of them that seek
him; yea, "before thou callest, he will answer, and while thou art
speaking, he will hear." And, precious blessed husband of thy church and
people! may I not consider this invitation as given also by thee to thy
church and to thy people, yea, to my poor soul? Methinks I hear thee
saying to me, personally to me, 'Come, my beloved; come, let us go forth
into the field of my word alone; let us go together also to the villages
of my people, and dwell in my house and vineyards: both in private and
in public will I manifest myself unto thee, and shew thee my loves.' Oh,
thou bountiful Lord! thy whole heart is love. All is grace, and mercy,
and kindness in Jesus; and all thou art, and all thou hast, is for thy
people, thy redeemed, thy Segullah, thy chosen! Lord, give me but grace
in the lively actings of faith, and my soul shall follow thee
"whithersoever thou goest!"</p>

<p>And didst thou, my poor, proud, vain, sinful heart, after so much as
hath been said to thee of Jesus, and so much as thou hast been feelingly
taught thy want of Jesus, didst thou need this precept? Oh yes, my soul;
every day it had need be sounded in thy ears, and wrote over again by
the Holy Ghost upon thine heart. Now it is, Lord Jesus, I learn from
hence why thou art so suited to a poor convinced sinner. Thou, and thou
only, art the Lord our righteousness: and therefore let those that know
not their own worthlessness, nor thy glory, boast in what they may; let
others talk of what they will, I see plain enough there s nothing out of
thee for a poor soul to rejoice in. The wise men hath no wisdom, but in
thee; nor the mighty man strength, nor the rich man riches, but if thou
art my portion, thou art made of God to me both wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption; and then indeed I shall glory in the
Lord!</p>

3—Evening—Zephaniah 1:7</h3>
<p>"Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the
Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his
guests."—Zephan. i. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, here is a portion of God's word, which, like the pillar of
the cloud in the camp of Israel, hath a double aspect; it becomes a
cloud of trembling indeed, of darkness, dread, and fear, to all who,
spiritually considered, are yet in Egyptian bondage, but a glorious
refreshing light to the people of God. The presence of the Lord God is a
solemn presence to all, and will command silence, yea, a trembling. "The
Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him."
And is the day of the Lord at hand? Yea, verily, every day brings it
nearer; every breath, every pulse that beats, shortens the distance.
There is, there must be, a day, in which "the Lord will judge the world
in righteousness, and minister true judgment unto the people." And
observe, my soul, what this blessed scripture adds: "The Lord hath
prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests." God hath set forth his
dear Son as a propitiation, for "without shedding of blood, there is no
remission." He hath bid his guests. Yes! the Lord that hath made this
rich feast of salvation, hath also invited the people he will have to
partake of it. He hath sent out his word, his servants, into the
highways, and lanes, and hedges of the city, to call them in. And their
characters are marked: they "are" the poor, and the needy, and the halt,
and the blind." Thousands, answering to this character, are come; have
partaken of the rich feast, and called it blessed; "and yet there is
room." My soul! art thou come? Hast thou accepted the invitation, and
come under this character? Hast thou found it blessed? Pause over the
inquiry. The reverse of this will be a cup of trembling, and
astonishment, and madness, to all that reject the counsel of God against
their own souls, who are too proud to accept the bidding to the feast of
Jesus's blood, to cleanse them, and too rich, in their own eyes, to look
for salvation in his righteousness to justify them.</p>

4—Morning—Isaiah 45</h3>
<p>"A just God, and a Saviour."—Isa. xlv.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou learnt, from the teaching of God the Holy Ghost,
to contemplate him, with whom thou hast to do, under these blessed
united characters? If thou hast, thou hast found it a blessed and an
approved way of opening communion with God, and maintaining that
communion alive in the soul. Thou knowest, then, that God, as a just
God, can admit of no pardon to sin, but upon the footing of a complete
satisfaction; for, without this, his truth and justice would still be
violated by unatoned sin. But if thou beholdest God in Christ,
reconciling the world to himself, and hast been taught by the Spirit
that Christ hath redeemed thee from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for thee; that, as thy surety and thy representative he hath paid
thy debt, and restored that which he took not away; here thou beholdest
indeed "a just God, and a Saviour," and hast learnt that precious,
blessed truth, how God can be just, and the justifier of every poor
sinner that believeth in Jesus. See to it then, my soul, that thou
keepest this precious thought always in view. Always blend together, in
all thy approaches to a mercy-seat, that thou art approaching "a just
God, and a Saviour." Never lose sight of the high demands of God's
righteous law; neither the perfect worth and efficacy of Jesus in his
blood and righteousness: and connect always with the blessed view thine
own personal interest in that obedience, by thy union with him. Then
wilt thou as much delight in God's justice as his mercy; and his
holiness will be as dear to thee as his love. Then wilt thou understand
that blessed truth, and join issue with it in every part: "Surely shall
one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength; even to him
shall men come; and all that believe in him shall not be ashamed nor
confounded, world without end."</p>

4—Evening—1 Kings 12:15</h3>
<p>"Wherefore, the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
from the Lord."—I Kings xii. 15.</p>
<p>What a light doth this one verse throw upon the whole of this
history, and upon ten thousand of a similar kind, which are perpetually
going on through life! The event recorded in this chapter that the king
should listen to the counsel of fools, and disregard the advice of wise
men, would have appeared incredible, the thing itself being so very
obvious. But when we understand the latent cause, and are told that it
was "from the Lord," how strikingly doth it set forth the wonderful
government of God in bringing about the sacred purposes of his holy
will! My soul, sit down this evening, and ponder well the subject. Think
how truly blessed it is, and how truly sanctified, to behold this
almighty hand in every dispensation. And bring home the doctrine itself,
for it is a very blessed one, if well studied and well followed up, to
thine own concerns and circumstances. When, in any of the providential
or gracious appointments of thy Jesus, thou art exercised and afflicted,
what can be thy relief, but seeing the cause as from the Lord? The sin
and transgression that induceth it, indeed, are all thine own. But the
over-ruling of it to thy future welfare and the divine glory is the
Lord's. Thus the man of Uz was grievously afflicted in every direction;
but we are told that the Lord's permission was in the whole; and the
sequel fully proved the Lord's design. Thus "the man after God's own
heart" was cursed by Shimei, in the moment when his life was sought
after by his own unnatural son; but what said David under the heavy
trial?—"Let him alone, for the Lord hath bidden him." And what a
gracious and sanctified improvement did he make of it, in proof that the
Lord, who was smiting, was also upholding: "It may be," said he, "that
the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite me
good for his cursing this day," 2 Sam. xvi. 5-12. My soul, behold every
cause, every event, and every dispensation, as from the Lord; "He ruleth
in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth." If he
afflict his children, still they are his children; the relationship
never lessens, neither is his love abated; "Whom the Lord loveth, he
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth." Doth he raise up
bad men to persecute them? Still they are but the sword; the government
of it is the Lord's. Doth Jesus speak in frowning providences, or hide
himself from giving out his accustomed gracious visits of love? Still he
is and must be Jesus. There is no change in him, whatever outward
dispensations seem to say. He saith himself, "I know the thoughts I
think towards you, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an
expected end," Jer. xxix. 11. Precious Lord Jesus, give me the seeing
eye, and the understanding heart, to behold thy hand in all, to rest
upon thy love and faithfulness in all, and to be for ever looking unto
thee under all; so shall I bless thee for all; and, sure I am, the issue
will be to thy glory, and my everlasting happiness.</p>

5—Morning—Psalm 148:14</h3>
<p>"The praise of all his saints."—Ps. cxlviii. 14.</p>
<p>And who is this, my soul, but Jesus? Is he not indeed both the praise
and the glory, the delight and the joy, the portion and the happiness of
all his people? His saints, doth it say? Yes, saints, made so by his
righteousness and salvation, when taken from among sinners; and when
themselves sinners, he hath washed them in his blood, clothed them with
his garment of salvation, and granted them an inheritance among the
saints in light. And is he not their praise? Indeed, is there any other
the object of their praise, to whom they look up, in whom they delight,
but Him, in whom God their Father hath made them accepted in Him, the
Beloved? Say then, my soul, is he not thy praise this day; and will he
not be thine everlasting, unceasing praise, every day, and all the day,
and through the endless day of eternity? Who shall be thy praise but
Jesus; his beauty, his glory, his excellency; in whom all divine
perfections centre? Who shall be thy praise but Jesus, the Mediator, the
Christ of God, whose glory it is to redeem poor sinners and make them
saints; to give out of his fulness, and grace for grace? Who shall be
thy praise, but he that hath made thy peace, in the blood of his cross,
and ever liveth to make intercession for thee? Oh thou fair and lovely
one, the chiefest among ten thousand, thou art my praise, my glory, my
song, my rejoicing! Every day, will I praise thee; morning by morning
will I hail thy name, and night by night testify thy faithfulness. Here,
while upon earth, will I unceasingly speak of thy praise; and, ere long,
I shall join the happy multitude above, in that song—"To him that hath
loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood!" Oh thou that
art the praise of all the saints.</p>

5—Evening—Genesis 8:22</h3>
<p>"While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat,
and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease."—Gen. viii.
22.</p>
<p>My soul, look at this gracious covenant promise of God, which was
made more than four thousand years since, and is as faithfully confirmed
to thy experience this night, as in the first hour wherein the Lord
delivered it. How hath the seed-time and harvest, the cold and heat, the
summer and winter, and day and night, through every generation,
proclaimed the unfailing truth! And although we are taught to expect,
and by faith both to look and to long for the "new heavens and the new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness;" yet is this blessed promise not
less sure, or less to be depended upon, while the present earth
remaineth. And do not overlook that special feature of divine
faithfulness, in the fulfilment of this gracious promise; I mean that
amidst all the unworthiness of man, God's bounty continues the same.
Were the sun to cease its beneficial influence, or the clouds to
withhold their fatness, until man deserved those blessings, the sun
would rise no more, neither would the bottles of heaven pour down their
fruitfulness. Sweet thought to the heart of a poor sinner! The Lord's
goodness is all in himself, and from himself, and to himself for his own
glory. Indeed, so abundantly gracious and compassionate is the Lord,
that he very frequently takes occasion from our misery, to magnify the
riches of his mercy; and "where sin hath abounded, grace doth much more
abound; that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord."
There is one delightful thought more arising out of this blessed
scripture, in the confirmation which the regular return of day and night
gives to the faithfulness of the almighty Promiser, namely, that the
Lord himself appealeth to this fulfilment of his covenant in nature, as
the confirmation that he will fulfil his covenant in grace. "Thus saith
the Lord, if ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the
night, that there should not be day and night in their season; then also
may my covenant be broken with David my servant," Jer. xxxiii. 20, 21.
Oh! precious words of a gracious covenant God in Christ! Lord, I bow
down before thee, under a deep sense of thy grace and love! Thou hast
indeed "sworn once in thy holiness, that thou wilt not lie unto David;"
even the David of thy people, thy dear and ever blessed Son! Oh! grant
that, each night and morning, as well as through all the changing, but
sure seasons of nature, all may be sweetly sanctified in their regular
visits to my soul, while remaining on earth; that I may have a double
relish and enjoyment in a sanctified use of them; and accept thy daily
faithfulness in nature, as a sure pledge of thy everlasting faithfulness
in grace, that "in Jesus all the seed of Israel shall be justified, and
shall glory."</p>

6—Morning—Luke 22:61</h3>
<p>"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter."—Luke xxii. 61.</p>
<p>My soul, hath that eye that looked so graciously upon Peter, looked
graciously upon thee? Pause and determine the point by the effects.
"Peter went out and wept bitterly." Hath such impressions of grace been
upon thee, my soul? Hast thou wept over the recollection of sin and a
ruined nature, which is continually manifesting itself in the same
faithlessness and worthlessness as in the apostle? Moreover, hast thou
ever looked with an eye of faith and love to Jesus? If so, it must be
wrought by this eye of Christ upon thee, my soul: for, mark it, we never
look to him with an eye of faith, until Jesus hath first looked on us
with an eye of love. If we love him, it is because he first loved us.
Sweet testimony this, if so be thou hast it in thine experience, that he
that turned and looked upon Peter, hath looked on thee also. Moreover,
any thing short of this glance of Jesus's eye, is short of all to induce
true repentance. Peter heard, unmoved, again and again, the crowing of
the cock; just as we hear, unmoved, the warnings of God's holy word in
his scriptures; until Jesus accompanied the crowing of the cock, which
he had admonished the apostle concerning, with his tender and
remonstrating look: then, and not before, the blessed effects were
wrought. Oh precious Master! turn, I beseech thee, and look on me; and
let that look enter my very soul, that I may "look on thee whom I have
pierced, and mourn as one that mourneth for his only son, and be in
bitterness as one that is in bitterness for his first-born." Let all my
soul's affection be continually going out after the look of Jesus, until
eye-strings and heart-strings break and give way; and when they close in
the sleep of death, may I, with the eyes of the soul, behold thy face in
righteousness, that I may be satisfied when I awake with thy
likeness.</p>

6—Evening—1 Peter 1:5</h3>
<p>"Ready to be revealed in the last time."—I Pet. i. 5.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever considered the very great and blessed things
contained in these few words? Sit down, this evening, and look them
over. Dost thou ask, what is ready to be revealed in the last time? The
answer is direct. All the fulness, glory, grace, provision, peace, and
everlasting happiness, that are in the covenant of redemption, and all
centered in the person and finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou
hast now but obscure views of Jesus, and his fulness, suitableness, and
all-sufficiency. Thou hast believed indeed unto salvation, and art
resting upon Christ for thy justification, and sanctification, and
comfort; but of the fulness in which believers stand complete in Christ,
no saint upon earth hath ever had a conception equal to what it really
is. "Beloved, (saith John) now are we the sons of God! and it doth not
yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear we
shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is," 1 John iii. 2. Now
the blessedness of these things, in all their fulness, and in all their
glory, are reserved to" be revealed in the last time:" and they are now
all ready. Angels are always upon the wing, and are waiting to bring the
heirs of the kingdom into the immediate possession, and immediate
enjoyment of them. And although clouds here rise between, to obscure
those bright and glorious objects, yet the heirs of promise ought to
enjoy them now by faith; for they are eternally secure, and, through the
Lord of them, eternally their own. Now, my soul, what sayest thou to
these things? Are they ready to be revealed in the last time? Are they
thine now? Hast thou Jesus, and with him all things? Is the last time
approaching? Are angels waiting? Is Jesus waiting to unfold all to thy
ravished view; and every thing ready? What sayest thou, my soul? Art
thou ready also? Lord Jesus! give me grace to be always on the look out
for thy coming, and to be as delighted with thy approach as they that
wait for the morning!</p>

7—Morning—Malachi 2:16</h3>
<p>"For the Lord the God of Israel saith, that he hateth putting
away."—Malachi ii. 16.</p>
<p>And well is it for thee, my soul, that he doth: for if the Lord God
of Israel had dealt by thee once, as thou hast been dealing with him
always, thou wouldest have been ruined for ever. But what is the cause
of thy mercies? Is it not the covenant faithfulness of God thy Father,
founded in his own everlasting love, engaged in his promise and his
oath, to Jesus, and secured in his blood and righteousness? And is this
the cause why the Lord God of Israel hateth putting away? Is this the
cause why God resteth in his love? Oh for grace to see the cause, to
adore the mercy; and where the Lord God of Israel rests, there, my soul,
do thou rest also. See to it, my soul, that thy life of faith, and thy
life of hope, are both founded in Jesus, and not in the sense thou hast
of these precious things. The things are the same, how different soever,
at different times, thy view of them may be. The everlasting worth, the
everlasting efficacy, of Jesus's blood and righteousness, is always the
same; and his people's interest in it the same, although, from the
different view we have of it, at different times, it seems as if
sometimes it were lost, and our own state was worse and worse. My soul,
upon such occasions call to mind this sweet scripture:" The Lord God of
Israel saith, that he hateth putting away." Observe, the Lord not only
doth hate putting away, but he saith it, that his people may know it,
and properly esteem his unchanging love. Oh to cry out under the
assurance of this precious truth, and to feel the blessedness of what
the Lord said by his servant the prophet:" The Lord thy God in the midst
of thee is mighty: he will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy, he
will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing."</p>

<p>"For the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden."—1 Sam. ix. 13.</p>
<p>I know not how scrupulous the Israelites were of not partaking of the
sacrifice, until the prophet Samuel had blessed it in the name of the
Lord; but well I know, no offering, under the gospel dispensation, can
be profitable or blessed, until Jesus be first seen in it, and first
enjoyed in it too. Surely, thou dear Lord! thou art the all in all of
every thing that is sacred, blessed, and interesting. Thou art the
altar, the sacrificer, and the sacrifice! And it can only be from thy
blessing upon our poor ordinances, when we hold a feast upon thy one
all-sufficient sacrifice, that any real enjoyment of a spiritual nature
can be found in them. Neither, Lord, till I hear thy bidding, can I
venture to eat. If Jesus indeed say," Eat, O friends, drink, yea drink
abundantly, O beloved;" then I feel a confidence in thy welcome to every
gospel feast, and" sit down under thy shadow with great delight, and thy
fruit is sweet to my taste." Come then, thou dear Lord! come to thine
own banquet; to thy church, thy table, thine house of prayer, thine
ordinances! Come and bless thy people, and command a blessing upon all
thine own appointments, and all will be blessed indeed!</p>

8—Morning—Deuteronomy 1:6</h3>
<p>"Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount."—Deut. i. 6.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, and remark the gracious words of God to Israel. They
were just entering the border of Canaan at that time. Forty years long
had they been in a wilderness state; many ups and downs, battles and
restings, conflicts and trials. God graciously said, "It is long
enough." "There is a rest that remaineth for the people of God." Hark,
my soul, doth Jesus speak to thee to the same amount? Hast thou indeed
dwelt long enough in this mount of exercises, sin, sorrow, and
temptation? Hast thou seen enough of the emptiness of all creature
comforts to satisfy thee? Hast thou felt enough of a body of sin and
death, which drags down the soul, to make thee groan under it, being
burdened? Is there any thing now worth living for? Are not the glories
above worth dying for? Doth Jesus call thee, invite thee, allure thee,
to come up to the Canaan which he hath taken possession of in the name
of his redeemed; and wilt thou not mount up upon the wings of faith,
love, and longing desire, to be for ever with the Lord? Doth Jesus say,
thou hast dwelt long enough here below? And wilt thou not say the same?
Doth Jesus call thee to his arms; and wilt thou say, not yet, Lord? Ah
my soul, art thou indeed in love with this prison? Dost thou wish to
wear thy chains a little longer? And is this thy kindness to thy friend?
Precious Lord, break down every intervening thought or passion that
would rob thee of thy glory, and my soul of thy presence, and give me to
cry out—"Hasten, my beloved! and be thou as a young hart upon the
mountains of Bether."</p>

8—Evening—Isaiah 1:8</h3>
<p>"He is near that justifieth me."—Isaiah 1:8.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever considered one of the sweet properties of
justification; not only in the fulness and completeness of it, and in
all the several blessings connected with it, as it ariseth out of
Jehovah in his own threefold character of persons; all and each taking
part in it; but also in that which this portion points out, the nearness
in which Jesus, the glorious justifier, always stands to thee, and
surrounds thee? Sit down, this evening, and contemplate the subject of
justification in this point of view, for it is indeed most blessed. All
the persons of the Godhead have, and are engaged in making it effectual
to every poor sinner, so as to give the mind always somewhat to rest
upon, in the assurance of it. God the Father is the source and fountain
of it, not only in having provided it in his dear Son, but also as
having by the justification of all the Redeemer's work, to all intents
and purposes, justified the poor believer in Jesus. Hence the apostle,
with rapture, exclaims: "It is God that justifieth; who is he that
condemneth?" Rom. viii. 33, 34. And it is Jesus that justifieth all his
redeemed, by his blood and righteousness; "for he was delivered for our
offences, and was raised again for our justification;" Rom. iv. 25. And
that the hand of God the Holy Ghost was in all this, is equally evident;
for it is as expressly said, that Christ was "justified in the Spirit;"
which would never have been the case, had not both God's law and God's
justice been satisfied, and thus justified Jesus, as the sinner's
surety. I Tim. iii. 16. Rom. i. 4. But, over and above these glorious
truths, as the foundation of every poor believer's hope, I charge thee
to mark it down, my soul, in the memorandums of thine inmost thoughts,
that as God the Father, who justified Jesus, thy surety, was always near
to him, so he that justifieth thee is always near to thee. The charter
of grace, and thy pardon written down in it in letters of blood, even
the blood of Christ, is always near and at hand. Here it stands on
eternal record," that God is just and the justifier of him that
believeth in Jesus." And he is near that justifieth, both as thine
advocate to plead, that if any doubts should arise in thy poor timid
mind concerning it, Jesus might open the volume of record, and there, by
his Holy Spirit, shew it unto thee; and also, by the same almighty
power, incline thy heart to the perfect belief of it, to thy joy and
peace in believing. Now I again charge it upon thee, this night, that
thou from henceforth never lose sight of the soul-reviving truth
contained in this blessed scripture. But when Satan accuseth, and fears
arise, and doubts would creep in, and both law and justice seem to be
reviving their claims, look not at thyself, but look to all-precious
Jesus. Behold him in all his fulness, suitableness, and all-sufficiency,
as thy law-fulfiller and sin-atoning surety, and cry out in those divine
words which the Holy Ghost hath given thee," He is near that justifieth
me!"</p>

9—Morning—Jeremiah 1:20</h3>
<p>"In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of
Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I
reserve."—Jeremiah 1:20.</p>
<p>What those days and that time refer to is very plain; namely, the day
when the great trumpet shall be blown, and when they shall come which
were ready to perish; the glorious day of gospel grace by Jesus. For God
the Father, having appointed and accepted a Surety for poor sinners, in
the blood and righteousness of his dear Son, beholds no iniquity in
Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel. Blessed thought to comfort a poor
soul—that, seen in Christ, and accepted in the beloved, "there is no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit!" Pause, my soul, over this precious
scripture, and take to thyself the comfort of it. If thou art in Christ,
thou art beheld righteous in his righteousness; and, as thy Surety, what
he wrought, and what he suffered, was for thee. So that, in this sense,
thou art, as Christ tells the church, all fair, and there is no spot in
thee. So that, amidst all thy groans for the remains of indwelling sin,
(and groan thou dost daily,) and as thou sometimes art prompted to
think, there is growing imperfection in thee; yet, in Jesus, as thou art
found and beheld in him, sin is pardoned, and thy person accepted, and
thou art in a state of justification before God in the righteousness of
God thy Saviour. And, as this is so essential to be known and enjoyed,
see to it, my soul, that thou livest upon it. Go in the strength of
Christ's righteousness every day to the throne, pleading that
righteousness, and that only. And, under a perfect conviction that not a
single sin of thine was left out when Jesus bore the sins of his people
on the tree, beg for grace to exercise faith, and to know that in Jesus
thou art justified before God, and that God hath cast all thy sins into
the depths of the sea. "Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
and goodness of God!" What shall separate from the love of
Christ?—surely not sin. For Jesus hath put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself! The law of God cannot: for that law, Jesus, as the sinner's
Surety, hath satisfied. And justice, so far from condemning, now
approves. God is just to his dear Son, as our Surety, who hath answered
all the demands of sin, and therefore hath forgiven sin, and cleansed
from all unrighteousness. Blessed thought! in this day sin is pardoned
in Christ: and in that day, when God shall arise to judgment, the sin of
Judah, and the iniquity of Israel cannot be found.</p>

9—Evening—Galatians 5:11</h3>
<p>"Then is the offence of the cross ceased."—Gal. v. 11.</p>
<p>The cross of Jesus was, of old, the great offence both to Jews and
Greeks; and, in the present day, we may add, it is so to every one, who,
by a perversion of language, calls himself christian, but yet denies the
Godhead of him whom he presumes to call Maker. And if the believer would
but relinquish this distinguishing feature in his Lord's person and
atonement for his sins by the blood of his cross, then indeed would the
offence of the cross cease. But, my soul, ask thyself, whether the
offence of the cross be ceased in thy view? Yea, rather, whether, like
Paul, not only the reproach of the cross is taken away for ever; but
thou art crying out with an holy indignation against all rejoicings but
in Jesus and his cross? Say, is it not thy daily, hourly song: "God
forbid that r should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world?" Gal. vi.
14. Is all thy glory in him, whom, in reproach, the world called" The
man hanged upon the tree?" Art thou for ever looking on him there, and
for ever rejoicing in the view? There, sayest thou, there hangs all my
confidence, all my joy, my security, my victories, my triumphs! Offence,
do they say? Witness for me, I would say, all ye angels of light, that
"this is all my salvation, and all my desire!" My soul utterly
renounceth, utterly despiseth every idea of any other Saviour, but my
Lord Jesus, and him crucified. Lead me, thou blessed Holy Spirit, lead
me to the continued celebration of my Lord's cross, in my Lord's supper.
There let Jesus Christ be evidently set forth crucified for me; and
there may I receive the bread and wine, the representations of his body
and blood, in token that I seek redemption in no other, but am heartily,
fully, completely satisfied and convinced, that "there is no other name
under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."</p>

10—Morning—Song of Solomon 1:12</h3>
<p>"While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the
smell thereof."—Song i. 12.</p>
<p>That was a precious testimony Mary gave of her love to Jesus; and
Jesus himself hath given his approbation of it, when she anointed
Jesus's feet with the spikenard. God our Father hath anointed his dear
Son; and so ought we. Surely God's anointed should be our anointed; and
if Mary poured forth the best of her offerings, my soul, do thou the
same. Indeed, while the king sitteth at his table, and reigneth in thine
heart, the graces will flow. Yes, thou heavenly King! when thou
spreadest thy table, and callest thy redeemed as thy guests, while thou
suppest with them, and they with thee, the humble spikenard, in the
heart of a sinner, awakened by thy grace, and brought forth into
exercise, will send forth all that shall testify love, and praise, and
affection, and duty, and regard. Do thou then, dearest Lord, sit as a
king frequently at thy table. Let me hear thy gracious invitation: "Eat,
O friends; yea, drink abundantly, O beloved!" And, O thou heavenly
Master! as all at the table is thine; the bread of life, the water of
life, the wine of thy banquet—and all is thine own, and of thine own do
thy redeemed give thee; "let me hear thy voice, let me see thy
countenance." And while thou givest forth thyself with all thy fulness,
O let my poor spikenard send forth faith and grace in lively exercise,
that I may eat of thy flesh, and drink of thy blood, and have eternal
life abiding in me.</p>

10—Evening—Deuteronomy 26:17</h3>
<p>"Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God.—And the Lord
hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people."—Deut. xxvi. 17,
18.</p>
<p>What a most lovely view doth this scripture hold forth of the solemn
transaction between God and his people! What an amazing thought, that
the High and Holy One, who inhabiteth eternity, should condescend to
propose and confirm such a covenant! and, my soul, dost thou think that,
in the charter of grace, sealed as it is in the blood of God's dear Son,
this covenant is less blessed or less sure? Doth not God confirm it in
every promise? Is it not read and ratified in every ordinance? And doth
not that Holy Spirit of promise set his seal to the whole," whereby we
are sealed unto the day of redemption?" Pause over the blissful subject!
Ponder it well, this solemn evening! Surely, every service, every
ordinance in the church of Jesus, becomes a confirmation of the blessed
truth. What, indeed, is the gospel itself, but God's covenant in Christ,
avouching himself to be our God, and addressed to the ear? And what is
the institution of the supper, but the same thing addressed to the eye?
And when received by faith, both become seals of the covenant, to
certify that the Lord this day, by this service, avouches himself that
he is, and ever will be our God; and we avouch, by the same, that we
are, and ever will be his people. Oh! it is sweet and refreshing at an
ordinance, yea, without ordinances, to be looking over, and reviewing
continually, those bonds of the covenant. Dost thou not feel an
inexpressible joy, and rapture, and delight, to look back on those
gracious transactions, which have passed between thee and thy God in
Christ? From the first Bethel visits of the divine love, through the
numberless renewals of it, in which thou hast heard his lovely voice
speaking to thee again, and saying to thee, as to Jacob of old, "I am
the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou
vowedst a vow unto me;" Gen. xxxi. 13. Yea, Lord! I have done, and still
do, and desire everlastingly to be found doing it. It is my daily prayer
to avouch thee to be my gracious Lord God in covenant, in the blood and
righteousness of Christ? And do thou, my glorious Lord God, avouch me to
be among the redeemed of thy people. Surely, Lord, in this charter of
grace, thou hast made over thyself, in all thy divine perfections, to be
thy people's. In this royal grant, as the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, "of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
all thine attributes are pledged for the fulfilment of thy covenant
promises to thy dear Son, and his church in him. Thy very name, Lord,
gives a being to thy engagements, and an assurance of their being
fulfilled. Yea, Lord, thou hast given thyself to thy people in Christ,
and commanded them to call thee theirs. Begin thy song, my soul, and
say, "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; he will
maintain my lot;" Psalm xvi. 5.</p>

11—Morning—Isaiah 25:4</h3>
<p>"For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy
in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when
the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall."—Isaiah
xxv. 4.</p>
<p>Who so poor as Jesus's poor? Who so needy as the needy of the
Redeemer? The world knoweth them not, because it knew him not. And as
the master was, so are his servants in this world. But, my soul, observe
how sweetly Jesus is all this. A strength to the poor in his distress,
by taking all the storm himself. He is a shadow from the heat, the heat
of the wrath of a broken law, which Jesus bore himself, when he died to
expiate the breaches of it. His blood and righteousness cool the heat of
sin, and quench all the fiery darts of the wicked: these terrible ones
which beat upon a poor sinner like a storm against the wall. Moreover,
when the showers of wrath shall fall at the last day on the wicked, when
that horrible tempest of fire and brimstone, the Psalmist speaks' of,
shall come down on the ungodly, Jesus will be an hiding-place from the
storm, and a covert from the tempest: not a drop can fall on those that
are under him, and sheltered by his blood and righteousness. As the
church is now said to sit under his shadow with great delight in this
wilderness state, and his fruit is sweet to her taste; so when she is
fairly come up out of it, having all along leaned upon her beloved, and
having entered with him into his glory; there will be both security and
delight, everlasting safety and joy. Precious Jesus, thou hast been a
strength indeed to my poor soul, and thou wilt be my portion for ever.
Oh give me to see my daily need of thee, to feel my poverty and
weakness; the exercises of persecution, both without and within; that
from all the terrors of the law, the alarms of guilt in the conscience,
the remains of in-dwelling sin in a body of death, which is virtually
all sin—the accusations of Satan, the just judgments of God; in thee,
thou one glorious ordinance of heaven, precious Lord Jesus, I may behold
myself secure in thee, and continually cry out, in the language of thy
servant the prophet, "Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I
righteousness and strength; even to thee do I come; and never shall I be
ashamed or confounded, world without end."</p>

<p>"And they said among themselves, who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre? (And when they looked, they saw that the
stone was rolled away) for it was very great."—Mark xvi. 3, 4.</p>
<p>My soul, how very often, like these poor women at the door of our
Lord's sepulchre, hast thou been at a loss to think whence help should
arise to succour thee in the needed moment? And how often, like them,
hast thou found, when looking again, all the difficulties which thou
hadst figured to thyself removed! And with thee the mercy hath been, if
possible, yet more striking. For thou not only needest the stone to be
rolled away from the door of the sepulchre, that thou mightest see
Jesus, but to have the stone taken away out of thine heart, that thou
mightest love and believe in Jesus to the salvation of thy soul. Is it
so then, that whilst, at any time, thou art putting forth the question
and inquiry, full of doubt, and fear, and misgiving, who shall help in
this or that difficulty; and when thou lookest again, behold the Lord
hath been better to thee than all thy fears, and "every mountain before
thy great Zerubbabel is become a plain?" Wilt thou not learn hence, that
thy Lord Jesus, with all his benefits, is not only set before thee, and
revealed to thee, but made over to thee, to be received, and to be
enjoyed, and to be made use of, by thee, for all and every purpose in
which his glory and thy salvation are concerned? The stone is indeed
very great in every heart by nature, and unmoveable by natural strength.
But look again. He that arose from the dead, and broke open the
sepulchre, can and will take it away, according to that sweet promise,
Ezek. xxxvi. 26. And if the stone be removed, and the fountain of life
broken up, in the person, and glory, and triumphs of Jesus, come then,
my soul, "and draw water out of those wells of salvation." Oh! how truly
blessed is it to see Jesus in all; and to enjoy Jesus in all; for then,
whatever great obstructions seem to lie in the way, the Lord himself
doth and will remove them. "He brings the blind by a way they knew not.
He causeth them to walk in places that they have not known. Crooked
things are made straight, and rough places plain: and all his redeemed
then see the salvation of our God!"</p>

12—Morning—John 3:14, 15</h3>
<p>"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish but have eternal life."—John iii. 14, 15.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over these words, and remember that they are the
words of Jesus. Call to mind the wonderful event to which Christ refers,
in the church's history in the wilderness, as related, Numb. xxi. 5—9.
Israel had sinned; and the Lord sent fiery flying serpents among the
people, which bit them, and they died. In their distress they cried unto
the Lord, and the Lord appointed this method of cure. A figure of a
serpent was made in brass, to which Israel was commanded to look only,
and be healed. They who did so, lived. If any refused, he died. This was
the ordinance of God. "Now," saith Jesus, "as Moses, at the command of
God, lifted up the serpent, so must I be lifted up; that whosoever
believeth in me shall never perish, but have eternal life." Now, my
soul, mark what the Saviour saith, and see the blessedness contained in
his precious assurance. It was a serpent, that stung the Israelites. It
was the old serpent, the devil, which poisoned our nature at the fall.
All his temptations, assaults, and poisons, are fiery. And when the
dreadful effects of sin are felt in the awakened conscience, how do they
burn with terrors in the soul! What could the dying Israelite do to heal
those venomous bites? Nothing. Would medicine cure? No. Was there no
remedy within the power of man? No; it baffled all art, it resisted all
attempts to heal. Such is sin. No prayers, no tears, no endeavours, no
repentance can wash away sin. If the sinner be restored, it must be by
the interposition and mercy of God alone. Now observe the method God
took with Israel—a figure of brass. And if, as some men tell us, any
thing shining like brass, to look upon, when the head and brain is
diseased, would make the person mad; so far was this serpent of brass
likely to cure, that it was the most unpromising thing in the world to
accomplish it. But yet it was God's command; and that was enough. It
infallibly cured. Look now to Christ. Here also is God's appointment,
God's command, God's authority. Christ was made in the likeness of
sinful flesh: and though holy in himself, yet becoming sin for us, that
we might be made the righteousness of God in him. The single precept is,
"Look unto me, and be ye saved." What, must I do nothing, bring nothing,
take nothing? No. The answer is, "look unto me." This is the appointed
way. Christ is the One only ordinance; Christ is the Altar, Offering,
High Priest. "If thou liftest up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted
it." Christ is the Father's gift for healing. In Jesus there is a
fulness to heal. Faith then hath a double plea—the authority of God the
Father, and the fulness of salvation in God the Son. Lord, I take this
for my warrant. Help me, thou blessed Spirit, so to look, so to depend,
so to fix my whole soul on this complete remedy for all my need, that
heaven and earth may witness for me, I seek salvation in no other, being
most fully convinced that there is salvation in no other; "neither is
there any other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be
saved."</p>

12—Evening—1 Corinthians 12:13</h3>
<p>"And have been all made to drink into one Spirit."—I Cor. xii.
13.</p>
<p>What a most lovely and endearing representation is here given of the
several members of Christ's mystical body, as all united to their one
glorious and common head, and, like so many branches of the vine,
deriving every thing of life, and grace, and fruitfulness, from him!
"They have been all made to drink into one Spirit." Yes; the Lord the
Spirit, the Holy Ghost the Comforter, whose gracious influence first
unites them to Jesus, unites them also, in him, to one another. Hence,
though distant and remote from each other; divided and separated by
distant climes, and countries, and languages; though unknown by face to
each other, yea, in language, and manners, and customs wholly
dissimilar; and of different degrees of knowledge, and apprehension, and
attainment in the divine life; yet, from being one with Christ, they are
also one with each other, and" are members of his body, of his flesh,
and of his bones;" part of the universal church, and constituting one
complete whole, of which Christ is the head: "whether one member suffer,
all the members suffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the
members rejoice with it." My soul, couldest thou ask the native of any
country or climate, who is a real member of Christ's body, what are his
feelings of sin, and what his views of Jesus, thou wouldest find a
complete correspondence with thine own. He hath groaned for sin, as thou
hast groaned; and he hath found Jesus precious, as thou hast found him.
And whence all this, but because one and the same almighty Teacher hath
been the instructor of both? "We have been all made to drink into one
Spirit!" He is the source and fountain of spiritual life, and
sustenance, and strength in all! And as the first quickenings of grace
arise from his divine influences, so is it from his blessed impressions
that believers are sealed and secured unto the day of eternal
redemption. Hail! thou holy and almighty Lord! cause the whole church of
Jesus to be for ever living at the fountain-head of mercies, "who have
been all made to drink into one Spirit!"</p>

<p>"And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy

<p>See, my soul, what a gracious provision the Lord made for the glory
and honour of his Israel, that ever traveller passing by might say,
'Here dwelleth an Israelite indeed; he hath the name of the Lord of
Hosts upon his house.' And did it please the Lord God of Israel so to
have his people known, and shall it be not my desire to have thy name,
Lord, upon the gates of my house. Shall any pass by my door, ignorant
that a lover of the Lord Jesus dwelleth there? Nay, shall I not esteem
it my highest honour to have it known whose I am, and whom I serve, in
the gospel of' his dear Son? Shall I be ashamed of that name before
which every knee bows in heaven and in earth? Oh Lord Jesus, not only
write thy name upon the gates of my house, but engrave it in the centre
of my heart, my affections, my first, and last, and earliest, and latest
thoughts! Let it be my rapture and my joy, to speak out of the abundance
of my heart concerning thee and thy great salvation. In all I say, in
all I do, let it be manifest that I am in pursuit of him whom my soul
loveth. Let every action tend to recommend thy dear name; and whether at
home or abroad, in my house or family, when lying down or when rising
up, let all creation witness for me, that the love, the service, the
interest, the glory, of my God in Christ, is the one only object of my
soul's desire; and let every thing speak this language; "Whom have I in
heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth I desire but thee; and
though my flesh and heart fail, yet thou art the strength of my heart,
and my portion for ever."</p>

13—Evening—Luke 17:7, 8</h3>
<p>"But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will
say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and sit down
to meat? And will not rather say unto him, make ready wherewith I may
sup, and gird thyself, and serve me till I have eaten and drunken; and
afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"—Luke xvii. 7, 8.</p>
<p>I have often thought that the Lord Jesus, the bountiful Lord of all
his servants, and who giveth largely to the supply of all his household,
hath a more special and suited food for his servants in the ministry,
who are employed by him to set forth his table for others. They are, as
the servant here described, in the field, plowing, and engaged in every
branch of the spiritual husbandry. But when they return, their peculiar
privilege is to wait upon their Master. And well is it for them; for in
the faithful discharge of their labours, so great and constant are their
engagements in following up the several departments of it, that, while
keeping the vineyard, the church, their own interests would be sadly
neglected and forgotten. Yet it is a most certain truth, that no servant
in a family can be faithful to his Lord's interest, who is not faithful
to himself. No minister of the Lord Jesus can be concerned for other
men's souls, who hath no concern for his own. How very blessed is it
then, that the Lord Jesus hath made suitable provision in this
particular, that when the public service of the day is over, he opens to
the private enjoyment of his people in himself alone. My soul, hath not
Jesus, in this delightful scripture, taught thee this sweet lesson?
Public ordinances will be doubly blessed, when, in the after-retirement,
we wait upon Jesus in private. And in the most busy life, there will be
always some moment found to do this. Jesus himself, "when he had sent
the multitudes away, went up into the mountain, apart, to pray." The
night opened to him the pleasures of communion, when the public services
had engaged him all the day. And will not thou, dear Lord, while thy
servant is waiting upon thee at thy table, bless him with some glimpse
of thy glory? Shall he not find himself, refreshed in hearing the
gracious words which drop from thy sacred lips? Will he not indeed
esteem "thy words more than his necessary food?" Yea, Lord, thou wilt
thyself be both his meat and his drink; and to wait on thee at thy table
will be found more blessed than all the unsanctified tables of those who
fare sumptuously every day!</p>

<p>"And he must needs go through Samaria."—John iv. 4.</p>
<p>And what was there, blessed Jesus, that constrained thee to this
necessity? Was it because there was a poor adulterous woman there, that
needed thy grace, and the hour was come for her conversion? Sweet
thought! let me cherish it this morning. Was there not the same needs be
for the Father setting thee up, from everlasting, for the head of thy
church and people? Could there have been a church without thee? And when
thy church had fallen by sin, what archangel could have recovered her
but thee? Why then there was a needs be that thou shouldest take the
nature of thy people upon thee, and come to seek and save that which was
lost. And as it is said of thee concerning this poor woman, that "he
must needs go through Samaria," so must it be equally said, Jesus must
needs go to Jerusalem, to save Jerusalem sinners by his blood. Oh yes,
there was a blessed necessity upon thee, thou Lamb of God, that thou
shouldest do all this. "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things,
and to enter into his glory?" My soul, indulge this precious thought yet
further, and see if there be not a needs be in thy Jesus for numberless
other occasions. Is there not a blessed necessity that Jesus should give
out of his fulness to his people? Is there not a needs be, when his
blessed gospel is preached, that he should be present to give virtue and
efficacy to the word delivered? Might not every poor, waiting, needy
sinner say, there is a blessed necessity Christ should be here? Surely
he is constrained by his promise, that where two or three are met in his
name, he is in the midst of them; and therefore he will come, he will
bless his word, he will give out of his fulness; for he knows my need,
and the need of all his people present. Nay, is not the glory of our
Jesus depending upon the receiving of his poor, and making them rich by
his bounty? Go one step further, my soul, this morning, as it concerns
thyself. Doth not Jesus know now thy state, thy want, thy circumstances,
and that thou art waiting for thy morning alms before that thou canst
leave his gate? Then is there not a needs be that he, who was
constrained to pass through Samaria, should come to thee? Precious,
precious Jesus! I wait thy coming; I long to hear thy voice. What I need
thou knowest. And as thy glory and my salvation are both blended, do for
me, Lord, as shall best conduce to this one end, and all will be well.
Jesus will be glorified, and my soul made happy. Amen.</p>

<p>"Which things the angels desire to look into."—I Pet. i. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, what an argument ariseth out of this view, of the angels of
light being inquisitive about man's redemption, to stir thee up to the
same most blessed contemplation! If in the apprehension of those
intelligent and exalted beings of light, the subject is so glorious,
what ought it to be to thee? If, as the words represent, they fix their
closest attention, and are lost in admiration, wonder, love, and praise;
how is it that thou, who art so deeply interested in the blissful theme,
shouldest forget it, as thou dost for hours together, and, even when
thou thinkest of it, contemplate it so very coolly? Oh for grace more
and more to study Jesus and his love, Jesus and his grace, Jesus and his
great salvation! But among the wonders of redemption, is there not one
point (and as it concerns thee, my soul, a marvellous one indeed it is)
which may well be supposed to call forth the greater astonishment of the
holy angels as they behold it; I mean, as they behold the glory of thy
Jesus advanced, not only when poor sinners praise him for what he is in
himself, and what he is to them, but when their emptiness, poverty,
wants, and wretchedness, afford the rich opportunity for the Lord Jesus
to get to himself glory in giving out of his fulness? Here, surely,
angels may well desire to pry into the cause, and be lost in the
contemplation. And, as it concerns thee, my soul, how must the angels,
"that are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister unto them that are
heirs of salvation;" how must they stand amazed, when they see thy Lord
waiting to be gracious unto thee, even in the very time when thou
wouldest tire every patience but his, "in wearying with thine
iniquities?" And how must their angelic minds feel amazed that Jesus
should get glory from such a poor worthless worm as thou art, in making
the riches of his grace to shine upon thee, while thousands, not more
undeserving, know him not, and are unacquainted with his grace and
mercy! Oh! gracious Lord! how is it that thou thus dost manifest thyself
to me otherwise than thou dost unto the world? Ye angels of light! ye
ministering spirits of my God! join with me in praise for my Lord's
graciousness to such a sinner; for, surely, your high intelligent minds
cannot but be lost in admiration, when beholding the aboundings of grace
exceeding even the aboundings of sin, and, in my instance, as far
surpassing "as the heavens are higher than the earth."</p>

<p>"As for me I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.—"Ps.
xl. 17.</p>
<p>My soul, sit down, and reckon up thy true riches. See what are thine
outward circumstances, and take an inventory of all thine inward wealth.
Thou art, by nature and by practice, one of the children of a bankrupt
father, even Adam, who lived insolvent, and died wretchedly poor in
himself, having entailed only an inheritance of sin, misery, and death,
with the loss of divine favour, upon the whole race of his children. By
nature and by practice thou art poor in the sight of God, despised by
angels on account of thy loathsome disease of sin; thine understanding
darkened; thy will corrupt; passions impetuous, proud, self-willed; all
in opposition to the law of God; exposed to all present evil,
everlasting evil; a slave to Satan, a willing captive in his drudgery;
hastening daily to death, to the second death, and with an insensibility
which is enough to make every heart mourn that beholds thee. Such, my
soul, was thy state by nature; and such, and far worse, would have been
thy state for ever, had not Jesus interposed, and looked upon thee, and
loved thee, when thou wast cast out to perish, and no eye to pity thee,
nor help thee from thy ruin. My soul, canst thou now say, though poor
and needy, the Lord thinketh upon thee? Oh blessed Jesus! thou dost
indeed think upon me, and provide for me, and hast given me to see, to
feel, my poverty, need, and misery; and to live wholly upon thee and thy
alms from day to day. Yes, Jesus! I would be poor, I would be needy; I
would feel yet more and more my nothingness, worthlessness, poverty,
wretchedness, that Jesus may be increasingly precious, and thy salvation
increasingly dear. Oh for grace, as a poor needy debtor, daily to swell
my debt account, that my consciousness of need may make thee and thy
fulness increasingly blessed. Let it be my daily motto—" As for me, I am
poor and needy; but the Lord thinketh upon me."</p>

<p>"A door-keeper in the house of my God."—Ps. 84:10.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever considered the blessedness of such an
appointment, of such an office, when truly followed up? If Jesus indeed
appoint, and both teach the nature of it, and give grace to the faithful
discharge of it, then is it most honourable, and truly blessed. A
door-keeper is supposed to know the several apartments of the house, and
to be well acquainted with his Lord and Master, in whose service he
ministers. He is supposed also to know who goeth out, and who cometh in;
whether his Lord be at home, and how his fellow-servants are employed in
their ministry. And if he be a faithful door-keeper, he will willingly
open to none but such as his Lord approves, but most gladly shew all
that come in his Lord's name, and are welcome to his Lord, the way to
his Lord's presence and his Lord's table. What sayest thou, my soul, to
such an office? Surely, to be" an hewer of wood, and a drawer of water,
in the service of the sanctuary," is an honourable employment; and how
much more to be "a door-keeper in the house of God!" The man after God's
own heart was so much delighted with the thought of God's house, that he
seemed to grudge the constant abode of the birds that made their nests
at the altar. Poor David, though a king in Israel, could only now and
then go up to the house of God, but these birds rested there. And under
the full impression of the happiness resulting from a constant
residence, he broke out in an hymn of praise:" Blessed are they that
dwell in thy house," whose home, whose abode, whose constant employment
is there; for "they will be still praising thee." Pause, my soul! hast
thou the same views as David? Consider wherein this blessedness
consists: the servants of the Lord, who dwell in their Lord's house, are
blessed, not because they are in the receipt of wages; not because their
bountiful Lord provides a table for them; but because he gives them
employment, and his praises are their meat and drink:" they will be
still praising thee," saith David. Yes! the house of God is then an
heaven below, where the servants of the Lord find their joy and
happiness from the everlasting praises of God and the Lamb! But, alas!
if the servants of the Lord's house, in any or all of the departments,
from the highest to the lowest, dwell there, not to glorify the Lord and
promote his honour, but to serve their own bellies, and, like the
finger-post to the traveller, stand to direct him in his way, but move
not a step themselves; so far from a blessedness, they will find in the
end of their labours, that the heaviest of all condemnations will
follow! Blessed Lord Jesus! thou wert a door-keeper indeed to thine own
house, that in all things thou mightest have the pre-eminence! Thou, for
the love thou hadst to thy Master, to thy church, thy wife, and thy
children, didst, like the Jewish servant, submit to have thine ear bored
at the door-post, to go out no more free, but to remain for ever. Oh!
for grace to cry out, in the review of such love as passeth knowledge,
"I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in
the tents of wickedness." See Exod. xxi. 5, 6.</p>

16—Morning—Zechariah 10:12</h3>
<p>"I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk up and down
in his name, saith the Lord."—Zech. x. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, mark these words, how precious they are; and mark the
Speaker and Promiser, and consider how sure they are. Is not this God
the Father speaking of the church, and most graciously assuring the
church that he will strengthen the church in Jesus, the church's
glorious Head? Is not this said with an eye to Christ, who is
represented in another part of this blessed prophecy as calling upon the
church to attend to him, who is come to build the temple of the Lord,
and to bear all the glory, and who expressly saith that the church shall
know that he, the Lord of Hosts, is sent by the Lord of Hosts unto his
people? Who but the Lord of Hosts could build the temple of the Lord of
Hosts; or who but him bear all the glory? Zech. vi. 12. So then, my
soul, observe that Christ is the strength, as well as the righteousness
of his redeemed. And do observe further, that when at any time thou art
strengthened in Jesus, it is the Father's gracious hand and office which
is manifested in this merciful act. If thou art drawn at any time to
Jesus, it is the Father's sweet constraining love that thus works upon
the soul. John vi. 44. If thou enjoyest at any time some new and
delightful revelation of Jesus, which lifts thee up with a joy
unspeakable, remember, my soul, from whom the blessing comes; and learn
to ascribe the mercy, the distinguishing mercy, as the apostle did, to
the Father's grace, when it pleased him to separate thee from thy
mother's womb, and called thee by his grace to reveal his Son in thee,
Gal. i. 15, 16. Yes, Almighty Father, it is thy special mercy, both to
give thy Son, and with him all things, to the highly favoured objects of
thine everlasting love. It was he who, from all eternity, didst
contrive, order, will, appoint, and prepare the great salvation of the
gospel, and choose Christ as the head, and the church as the body of
this stupendous work of redemption. It is thou which hast carried on and
executed all the great designs; and it is thou who dost strengthen and
complete the whole in the final salvation of all the members of it, in
grace here, and glory hereafter. Blessed, holy compassionate Lord God!
for Jesus's sake fulfil this promise daily in my soul; bear me up, carry
me through, and strengthen me in the Lord my God, that I may indeed walk
up and down in his name, until thou bring me in to see his face in thine
eternal home, and dwell under the light of his countenance for ever.</p>

16—Evening—Genesis 24:63</h3>
<p>"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the even-tide."—Gen,
xxiv. 63.</p>
<p>My soul, every season is suited for meditation, if the Lord the Holy
Ghost suit the mind for the employment. But unless he prepare the heart,
no preparation will be found in any season. What multitudes are there,
to whose unthinking minds neither the morning breath nor the evening
call, in the Lord's mercies in providence and in grace, have any
hearing? They arise, as they lay down, unconscious and unconcerned as to
whom they are indebted for keeping their persons and their
dwelling-places in safety. They put on the garment to cover and adorn
the body, but are ignorant that their souls are without clothing! They
wash and refresh the body, but the pollution of the soul they see not!
They are anxious to preserve the casket, but the jewel it contains,
falls under their feet, as an object of no value! My soul, do thou look
at the patriarch Isaac, and take him for thy pattern. He went out" to
meditate in the field at the even-tide!" He turned his back upon the
house and family, and sought, in the solitude of the field, to have his
mind disengaged from men, that he might be wholly engaged in devout
communion with God. And is not the present evening suited to thee for
this purpose. It is a calm and serene season, and every thing invites
thee to the employment. Thy wants and necessities; the solemn inquiry
how thou art advancing in grace, and in the knowledge of thy Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ; the consciousness that another day of thy
pilgrimage is ended, and thou art by so much the nearer thine eternal
home; every momentous interest belonging to a dying creature in a dying
world, presses the matter upon thee, to ponder the path of thy feet,
which, in every step, is leading thee to eternity. Go then, if not to
the field of nature, yet to the field of grace, and if thou hast no
closet to retire to, yet retire to thine own heart, and there meditate
on all those interesting subjects which belong to an immortal soul.
Jesus waits to meet thee, to be gracious to thee, and he will shew thee
his secret. Oh, thou dear Lord of thy people! cause me to delight in
those sweet and sacred interviews! Let every evening toll the bell of
recollection to call home my poor wandering heart; and when the tumult
of a busy, unsatisfying, and troublesome world is over, Oh! for grace to
do as my Lord did;" send the multitude away, and get up apart into the
holy mountain" of faith and love in the Lord Jesus, "to meditate and
pray!"</p>

17—Morning—1 Thessalonians 5:25</h3>
<p>Brethren, pray for us."—I Thess. v. 25.</p>
<p>My soul, mark how earnestly the apostle sought an interest in the
prayers of the faithful. And if so eminent a servant in the church of
Jesus thus entreated to be remembered by the brethren at the mercy-seat,
how needful must it be that the brethren should remember one another;
not only ministers to pray for the people, but the people for their
ministers. "Brethren, pray for us," should be the constant request of
every lover of Jesus. Methinks I would ask every one that I knew to be a
constant attendant at the heavenly court, to speak for me to the king
when he was most near, and in the enjoyment of his presence. Tell the
Lord, I would say, that his poor prisoner needs his alms, longs for his
grace, and is waiting the anxious expectations of his visits. Beg for
me, that I may live always under the blessed tokens of his love, that I
may be ever living near the Lord, and strong in the grace which is in
Christ Jesus. And do tell his Sovereign Majesty that the one great
object of my soul's desire is, that I may have increasing views of the
infinite dignity of his person, work, merit, offices, relations,
characters, and in short, every thing that relates to one so dear, so
lovely, so glorious, and so suited to a poor sinner, as the Lord Jesus
Christ is in all things. And do add for me, that my humble suit is, that
after he hath given me all in gifts and graces that he sees needful for
me in my pilgrimage state, that Jesus will give me yet more than all, by
giving me himself, and causing my heart to be dissatisfied with all but
himself; for until Jesus himself be my portion, I still have not what I
want. It is not enough to give me life; but he himself must be my life.
It is not enough to give me rest, unless he himself is my rest, and I
rest in him. Precious Jesus! I would say, in thyself is all I need: all
to pardon, all to justify, all to sanctify, all to glorify, all to
satisfy, all to make happy here and for ever. Brethren, let this be your
prayer for me, and it shall be mine for you; that Jesus be the all in
all of our souls, and our portion for ever.</p>

17—Evening—Psalm 22:30, 31</h3>
<p>"A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
people that shall be born, that he hath done this."—Ps. xxii. 30,
31.</p>
<p>It is precious, yea, truly blessed also, to discover the happy
correspondence subsisting between the several parts of scripture, in
their testimony concerning the features of God's people. Jehovah, in his
threefold character of person, is always found as engaged in it; and
each One in the holy and undivided Three gives assurance to it. "I will
pour my Spirit, (saith God the Father speaking to the person of his dear
Son, as the Israel of his people) upon thy seed, and my blessing upon
thine offspring," Isa. xliv. 3. "A seed, (saith Christ, or, as it might
be rendered, and indeed is rendered in the version of the psalms read in
the churches, my seed) shall serve him." This is the very seed which the
Lord hath blessed, and which all that see shall acknowledge; Isa. lxi.
9. "the people which Jehovah formed for himself," which he gave unto his
Son, and "which shall shew forth his praise," Isa. xliii. 21. And as
both the Father and the Son have thus marked them with these striking
particularities, so the Holy Ghost as plainly sets his seal to the great
truth, and confirms who they are, by making them" willing in the day of
his power." Now, my soul! behold, in this most blessed scripture, how
decidedly the characters of the seed of Christ are marked, and trace
thine own features in them. The seed of Christ, his offspring, his
people, his redeemed, more or less delight in the Lord; they serve the
Lord; and they are numbered, accounted to the Lord as his people, his
generation. And they are as truly his by the new generation in grace, as
they are by the old generation in nature, the seed of Adam after the
flesh. So they are accounted, accepted, and received, in God's sight.
Mark also another blessed property by which they are known: "They shall
come, and shall declare his righteousness." Yes! for the language of
every one of them is, "I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of
thine own," Ps. lxxi. 16. Yea, the name by which they call their Holy
One their Redeemer is, "The LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS!" Neither is this
all: for they shall not only renounce every thing in themselves, as in
any way a procuring cause to this blessedness; but, both in original
design, and in actual possession, they shall refer all unto the
unsearchable goodness, and mercy, and grace of God. The work, and glory,
and praise, are all the Lord's, and all the declarations of it shall be
to this amount: that the Lord "hath done it!" What sayest thou, my soul,
to this precious and blessed testimony of Jehovah? Surely, thou canst,
and wilt set to thy seal, "that God is true!"</p>

18—Morning—Song of Solomon 7:5</h3>
<p>"The king is held in the galleries."—Song vii. 5.</p>
<p>And who but Jesus is King in Zion? As one with the Father over all,
God blessed for ever, he is indeed the King eternal, immortal,
invisible. And as Mediator God-man, he is my God and King, both by his
conquest of my heart, and the voluntary surrender of my soul. Yes,
blessed Jesus, I not only hail thee my God and King, but I would have
every knee bow before thee, and every tongue confess that thou art Lord
and King, to the glory of God the Father. But, my soul, what are those
galleries where thy King is held? Are they the scriptures of truth,
where Jesus is held and retained, adored and admired? Or are they the
public ordinances of thine house, or the place where thine honour
dwelleth; or the secret chamber, or the closet of retirement and
meditation; when thou comest to visit thy people, and when thou knockest
at the door of their hearts, when thou comest in to sup with them, and
they with thee? Well, my gracious, condescending Lord, be they what they
may, or where they may; methinks, like the patriarch, when thou comest
to wrestle with my poor, heedless and sleepy heart, I will hold thee in
the galleries, and say, as he did," I will not let thee go, except thou
bless me." I would say, as another famous patriarch did, "My Lord, if I
have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy servant. Rest
yourself under the tree; and I will fetch a morsel of thine own bread,
and of thine own giving, and comfort ye your hearts: for therefore are
ye come to your servant," Gen. xviii. 3-5. I would entreat thee, Lord,
not to be as the wayfaring man, that turneth in to tarry but for the
night: but I would hold thee in the galleries of thine own graces, and
thine own strength, imparted to my poor soul; and I would beg of thee,
and entreat thee to tarry until the dawn of day, and make thyself fully
known unto me, in breaking of bread, and in prayer. Yes, my adorable
King, my Lord and my God! I would detain thee in the galleries, I would
hold thee fast, I would not let thee go, until that I had brought thee
into my mother's house, the church—and until thou hadst brought me home
to thine eternal habitation which is above; and there to sit down at thy
feet to go out no more, but at the fountain head of joy to drink of the
spiced wine of the juice of the pomegranate in everlasting felicity.</p>

18—Evening—1 John 2:6</h3>
<p>"He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even
as he walked."—I John ii. 6.</p>
<p>Sweet testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus, when, from being in
Christ, we are walking with Christ; and one and the same spirit runs
through both. As a man never walks as Christ walked, before he is first
united to Christ; so when truly united to Christ, the evidence is made
to appear by loving what Jesus loves, and hating what Jesus hates. As
Ruth said to Naomi, so the believer saith to the Lord Jesus: "Where thou
goest, I would go, and where thou lodgest, I would lodge; thy people
shall be my people, and thy God my God!" And, my soul, think what a
blessed unanswerable proof doth it afford, both to thyself and to the
world around, when, from abiding in Christ, we live as Christ; that is,
his Holy Spirit moves in us, speaks in us, walks in us, yea, doth all in
us; and as the soul of man gives life and action to the body, so Christ,
who is the soul of the believer, gives life and action to the soul.
Hence Paul considered himself so wholly actuated, in every part of the
spiritual life, by the in-dwelling residence of the Spirit of Christ,
that he said, it was not he that lived, but Christ that lived in him:
"The life," saith he, "which I now live in the flesh, I live by the
faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me:" Gal.
ii. 20. My soul, canst thou subscribe to the same? "If Christ be in
thee, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of
righteousness;" Rom. viii. 10. Oh! for grace so to abide in Jesus, that
every act of my life may testify" whose I am, and whom I serve;" and
like that martyr, who to every question put to him, only answered, "I am
a christian;" so, my soul, may every act, every word, yea, every thought
of thine, so proclaim Jesus, and thy union and oneness with him, that
all with whom thou hast to do may plainly discover thou art no longer
thine own, but that, "being bought with a price, thou dost glorify God
in thy body, and in thy spirit, which are both his."</p>

19—Morning—Revelation 3:8</h3>
<p>"I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it."—Rev.
iii. 8.</p>
<p>Blessed Jesus! thou hast indeed done all this, and more. Thou art
thyself the door into thy fold here below, and to thy courts above; for
thou hast said, by thee, "whosoever entereth in, shall go in, and find
pasture:" and it is thou that hast opened a new and living way by thy
blood. Thou art the only possible way of access to the Father. And
because thou hast opened it, no man can shut it; for thou ever livest to
keep the way, which thou hast once opened, still open, by thy all
prevailing intercession. Yes, thou heavenly Lord, the gate is never
shut, day nor night, in the preaching of thine everlasting gospel, all
the ends of the earth shall see this salvation of our God. And, as thou
hast graciously said, all that come to God by thee, shall never be shut
out. The word, the authority, the warrant of Jehovah, is gone forth to
this purpose. Thy blood and righteousness secure it. The Spirit sets his
seal to it. Thou wilt receive, thou wilt bless, thou wilt cause all the
Father hath given thee to come to thee; and thou wilt keep the door
always open for all comers. Oh heavenly way! Oh precious, endless
salvation! My soul, see to it that thou art entered in, and there
abidest securely. Oh ye! my fellow sinners, yet without, rouse up from
your carnal security and sloth, before the master of the house hath
arisen and shut to the door; and ye then, too late, cry out, "Lord,
Lord, open to us. Now is the accepted time; now is the day of
salvation."</p>

19—Evening—Job 14:6</h3>
<p>"An hireling his day."—Job xiv. 6</p>
<p>The sufferings of Job are proverbial; but the sermons of this
exercised believer, though delivered from a dunghill, were sweet
sermons. The figure of an hireling' accomplishing his day (and that a
day, both on account of original sin and actual transgression, fleeting
and full of labour and sorrow) forms a just, though sad representation
of human life. But this, like all the other circumstances of our fallen
state, when read through the medium of the gospel, and softened and
sweetened with the blood of Christ, puts on a different aspect. It is
then found in its shortness to be the better, and in its crosses to be
the more sanctified; and, like Samson's riddle, "out of the eater to
come forth meat, and out of the strong to bring forth sweetness;" Judges
xiv. 14. It is the blessed property of grace, to work by contraries; so
that the cross of Jesus, like the tree cast into the waters of Marah,
put into our hireling life, sweetens all. My soul, if thou art taken
from the rubbish of nature, into the house and service of Jesus as an
hireling, it is not until the day of the hireling he accomplished, that
the Lord of the vineyard bids the steward to call the labourers, and
give them their hire. It was only" in the end of the world," that Jesus
himself appeared, "to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself." Is the
hireling's life to be regretted, because it is short, when every portion
of it is marked with sin, and consequently is unsatisfying? Yea, is not
rather its shortness rendered blessed? And if all the comforts and
blessedness of God's house are treasured up for the labourers of his
house, when the evening is come, and the steward is commanded to call
them home to be paid; doth it not comfort thee, my soul, in the thought
that thy life here is but as that of an hireling? Hath Jesus passed by,
and employed thee, and sent thee into his vineyard, when thou wert
standing idle at the market-place? Hast thou been doing the work of the
day in the day, according to the Lord's appointment? Hath thy Lord's eye
been upon thee, and, like another Boaz, come from Bethlehem, hath Jesus
often visited thee, blessed thee, held up thine hands, refreshed thy
soul, and made thee glad with the light of his countenance? Ruth ii. 4.
Oh! then bless him, that thy continuance here is but as "an hireling in
his day." The evening will come; the hour is at hand, when Jesus will
call thee home to his "house, not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens;" when all the blessings of the everlasting covenant will be
given to Jesus's labourers, and the supper of the Lord will be spread;
and all his redeemed shall sit down with him, to go out no more for
ever! Amen.</p>

<p>"Behold the man whose name is the Branch."—Zech. vi. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, listen to the call, and behold this wonderful Man, whose
name is the Branch. Mark the wonderful features of his person. This is
one of the prophetical names of Him, in the faith of whom, as the
Redeemer of Israel, all the old testament saints died. The branch of the
Lord—the branch of righteousness; or, as he is elsewhere called, the
Nazarene. But observe how very descriptive of his nature is this title.
He grows up out of his place. And where is that? rain the eternal
counsel of Jehovah. Who shall declare his generation? He is indeed a rod
out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots. But all this as
the root himself of David; planted in the eternal purpose of God's own
sovereign decree, and budding forth as a branch in all the periods of
his incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, glory. And what a
branch of never-failing loveliness, and everlasting verdure and
fruitfulness, in all the proclamations of his gospel, converting
sinners, and comforting saints. And what an eternal perennial branch to
all his redeemed in grace and glory. Hail, thou glorious, wonderful Man,
whose name is the Branch! Thou art indeed, as the prophet described
thee, beautiful and glorious in the eyes of all thy redeemed. On thee,
Lord, would I hang all the glory of thy Father's house, and all the
glory of my salvation. May it be my portion to sit under thy shadow with
great delight here, until thou bring me home to sit under thee, the tree
of life, in the Paradise of God, in the fulness of enjoyment of thee for

20—Evening—John 15:1</h3>
<p>The true vine."—John xv. 1.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus, how shall I ever be able sufficiently to admire, much
less adore thee, for thy wonderful and unequalled condescension? What
image, what similitude in nature, hast thou made use of here, in that of
the vine, to mark the lowliness and meekness of thy person; and in the
same moment, thy fruitfulness, and love, and usefulness to thy people!
It was truly prophesied of thee, my Lord, that thou shouldest be "as a
root out of a dry ground." And what so apparently dry and unpromising,
before the budding season, as the vine? It was said that thou wouldest
have "no form nor comeliness, nor any beauty, that we should desire
thee." And here when thou callest thyself "the true vine," surely, Lord,
thou couldest have chosen no image more unsightly. It was said, that
thou shouldest be "lowly and meek, when coming with salvation." And what
so low as the vine, that sends forth her branches upon the ground? What
so weak and feeble as the vine, that needs always some prop or stay to
cast her feeble arms upon? Thy extent, O Lord, in the spreading of thy
gospel, was prophesied to be "from sea to sea, and from the river unto
the ends of the earth." And truly, Lord, in the wide-spreading branches
of the vine, thou art the fruitful bough of Joseph, "even a fruitful
bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall." And when we see the
multitude of thy people all hanging on thee, all united to thee, and all
drawing sap, and moisture, and life, and strength, and fruitfulness from
thee; what can more beautifully represent Jesus and his people than the
rich vine and her branches, on which grow the fullest clusters of the
pure blood of the grape? Precious Lord Jesus, thou art indeed "the true
vine," and "the plant of renown," which, for wholesomeness, verdure,
nourishment, and delight, surpasseth the whole creation of God. Lord,
let me sit under thy shadow, let me taste of thy fruit, "for they that
dwell under thy shadow shall return, they shall revive as the corn, and
grow as the vine, the scent thereof shall be as the wine of
Lebanon!"</p>

influence, and cause me to feel all the sweet anointings of the Spirit
sent down upon the hearts and minds of thy redeemed, as the fruits and
effects of Jesus's exaltation, and the promise of God the Father. Yes,
blessed Spirit, cause me to know thee in thy person, work, and power; in
all thy offices, characters, and relations. I need thee day by day, as
my Comforter. I need thee, as the Spirit of truth, to guide me into all
truth. I need thee, as the Remembrancer of the Lord Jesus, to bring to
my forgetful heart all the blessed things he hath revealed to me. I need
thee, as the witness of my Jesus, to testify of my wants, and his
fulness to supply. I need thee, as my advocate and helper, in all my
infirmities in prayer. I need thee, as the earnest of the promised
inheritance, that I may not faint, nor want faith to hold on and hold
out in all dark seasons. I need thee, Lord; nay, I cannot do a moment
without thee, nor act faith, nor believe a promise, nor exercise a
grace, without thy constant, thine unceasing agency upon my poor soul.
Come then, Lord, I beseech thee, and let me be brought under thine
unceasing baptisms. Shed abroad the love of God my Father in my heart,
and direct me into the patient waiting for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"He made a feast unto all his princes, and his servants; the power of
Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces being before
him. When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honour
of his excellent majesty, many days, even an hundred and fourscore
days."—Esther i. 3, 4.</p>
<p>Who can read the account here given of the royalty and liberality of
the Persian monarch, without having the mind immediately directed to
look at the Lord Jesus, in his royalty and grace, and to consider both
the extent of his bounty, and the honour of his excellent majesty,
compared to which this earthly potentate sinks to nothing? What though
his kingdom reached over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces, from
India to ?thiopia; what is this to Him, whose dominion is "from sea to
sea, and from the river even unto the ends of the earth;" yea, who hath
"all power in heaven and in earth," and hath "the keys of hell and the
grave?" And what a day, in point of duration, was that feast, which,
though extended to a hundred and fourscore, yet, when ended, left
nothing to follow, but perhaps induced sickness and sorrow; when we
contemplate that eternal and everlasting day, to which Jesus invites,
and in which he entertains all his people, whom he hath made "kings and
priests unto God and the Father," and where they shall not only feast
with him, and he with them, but shall sit down with him on his throne,
as he hath overcome, and is sat down with his Father, on his throne? And
in this one eternal and never-ending feast of the Lord Jesus, from which
the guests shall go out no more, there is nothing to nauseate, nothing
unpleasant to mingle, but all is light, and joy, and peace, and
unspeakable felicity. Here Jesus openly sheweth the riches of his
glorious kingdom, and the honour of his excellent majesty! Here he
brings his redeemed into a perfect acquaintance with himself, and opens
to their astonished unceasing contemplation and delight, the wonders of
his person, and the wonders of his love; and fills their ravished souls
"with joy unspeakable and full of glory," in the knowledge of "the
mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ." Hail, thou glorious
King of kings, and Lord of lords! Here thou art making a feast of grace
in thine holy mountain, for all thy poor and needy, and halt, and blind,
whom thou hast made the princes of thy kingdom, and whom thou wilt
bring, in thine own good time, to the everlasting feast of glory in thy
kingdom above! Grant me, blessed Jesus, to be one of the happy number
who partake of thy bounties of grace here, and sure I am, that I shall
then one day sit down to the everlasting enjoyment of thyself in the
glories of heaven for ever!</p>

<p>"The justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."—Romans iii. 26.</p>
<p>And who is this, indeed who can it be, but Jehovah? "It is God that
justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?" But, my soul, mark how each
person of the Godhead is revealed in scripture under this character; as
if to convince every poor sinner that is looking for redemption in
Israel only in Jesus, that God can be just, and yet the justifier of him
that believeth in Jesus. God the Father justifieth the poor believing
sinner: for he manifests that he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, having found a ransom in the blood of his Son for sin, whereby he
is faithful to all his covenant promises in pardoning us, having
received at our Lord's hand double for all our sins. God the Son
justifieth also his redeemed: for it is expressly said by the prophet,"
In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory."
And that God the Holy Ghost justifieth, is as evident also; because it
was through the eternal Spirit the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
was offered, by which Christ is said to have been justified in the
Spirit; and believers are said to be justified by virtue of it in the
name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Hence all the
persons of the Godhead concur in the act of justifying every believer in
Jesus; by whom we have peace with God, fellowship with the Father, and
with his Son Jesus Christ. Here then is a portion to live upon through
life, in death, and to all eternity.</p>

22—Evening—1 Corinthians 4:7</h3>
<p>"Who maketh thee to differ from another?"—I Cor. iv. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, sit down, in the cool of this lovely evening, and in the
recollection of distinguishing mercies look up and behold the gracious
hand that" maketh thee to differ from another; until thine heart
overflow, in a view of the wonderful subject, with thanksgiving, love,
and praise. If thou wilt open the volume of thine own life (and surely,
of all volumes, when explained by the word of God, it is the most
interesting to read) thou wilt behold such a multitude of instances, in
all the departments of "nature, providence, and grace," as under divine
teaching, will bring home the question with the most awakened
earnestness to the heart, and cause thee frequently to exclaim, as thou
passest on, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?" Every defect of
nature in others, every poor cripple, or the blind, or deaf, which thou
meetest with; the want of intellect, or the want of understanding, yea,
that thou wert not born among the reptiles of the earth, but among them
who are created in the image of God, may, and ought to direct thy heart
to the contemplation of him and his distinguishing favour, "in whose
book all thy members were written!" And when, from the kingdom of
nature, in the appointments of the Lord, thou followest the tract of
thine own history into the kingdoms of providence and grace, and
beholdest through all, and in all the distinguishing mercies with which
thy life hath been marked, the question will arise all around, and in
every direction, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?" What a mercy
to be born in this land of thy nativity, and not among the dark places
of the earth, where the name of Jesus was never heard, nor the sound of
the church-going bell invites sinners to salvation! What a mercy to have
had praying parents, who sought blessings for us before we had power to
ask for ourselves! Or, on the other hand, if sprung from ungodly
parents, who never, by advice or example, led us to the throne of grace,
what a mercy, that under all such unpromising circumstances, without
advice and without example, the word of God, and the ordinances of
Jesus, are dear to us! Surely the apostle's words enter with a strength
of inquiry under these views, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?"
And, my soul, if now, as from a rising ground, thou lookest back, and
tracest "all the way which the Lord thy God hath brought thee these many
years, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and to shew thee what was in
thine heart," thou beholdest thy Lord's gracious dealings with thee,
compared to others: how many with whom, in thy boyish days, thou
enteredst the field of life together, that are now no more; how many
that still survive, but know not the Lord; how many, in circumstances
far more promising than thine, and yet have come short of the grace of
God! Views like these, and all the thousand, and ten thousand incidents
connected with them, instead of lifting the mind with pride, are enough
to humble the soul to the dust before God, and melt all the finer
affections into the most heartfelt sense of the apostle's question, "Who
maketh thee to differ from another?" Jesus, my Lord, behold me at thy
feet! How shall I dare lift mine eyes to thee, while in the moment of
recollection of thy distinguishing mercy towards me, I call to
remembrance my baseness towards thee? Lord, is it possible, that in a
life where so much grace hath abounded, sin should so much abound? That
in every spot where my God hath erected a monument of his love, my
sinful and ungrateful heart should have left an inscription of my
unworthiness! What others feel, I know not; but blessed, for ever
blessed be the unwearied patience and goodness of my God, that through
his distinguishing grace alone, I am what! am; and while my soul desires
to refer all and every part of divine mercy, in all the departments of
nature, providence, and grace, into the Lord's own free, and rich, and
sovereign pleasure; I praise him for having given me that precious
testimony in my soul, which the Lord himself said should be the
consequence, inwrought by his divine teaching in the heart: "I will
establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord;
that thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth
any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all
that thou hast done, saith the Lord God." Ezek. xvi. 62, 63.</p>

<p>"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is
not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?"—Jer. viii.
22.</p>
<p>Yes, there is both balm in Gilead, and a physician there. For the
blood and righteousness of Jesus is the truest balm; and Jesus himself a
Sovereign and an Almighty Physician. But if that blood be not applied,
if Jesus be not known nor consulted, how shall health be obtained? My
soul, hast thou known thy disease, felt thy disorder? Art thou convinced
that it is incurable by all human means—no medicine, no earthly
physician, can administer relief? Hast thou known these things? And
convinced of the infinite importance of seeking elsewhere, art thou come
to Jesus? What sayest thou, my soul, to the enquiry? Art thou acquainted
with Jesus? Hast thou made known thy case to him? And hath he told thee
all that is in thine heart? Hath he taken thee under his care? Is he
administering to thee the balm of Gilead? Oh my soul, see to it that
nothing satisfieth thy mind, until that thou hast heard his
soul-reviving voice, saying, "I am the Lord that healeth thee," Exod.
xv. 26. Seek it for thy life. Say unto the Son of God, "Speak but the
word, Lord, and my soul shall be healed."</p>

23—Evening—Revelation 12:16</h3>
<p>"And the earth helped the woman."—Rev. xii. 16.</p>
<p>How blessed is it to see the hand of the Lord, when no hand beside
can be near to help! and that when our situation is as lonely and
forlorn as that of the pelican in the wilderness, Jesus is still near;
and we are never less alone than when alone! When the church brought
forth her offspring, and hell stood ready to devour it, God sheltered it
from his jaws. And when he cast forth a flood to sweep the church away,
the earth helped the woman, by opening its mouth, and swallowing it up.
My soul! look into thine own circumstances, and trace the Lord's
dealings, and thou wilt find a great multitude o£ corresponding
instances. It is from the inattentive minds of the Lord's people, that
mercies so often pass and repass, and they see them not. There are
thousands of them in every believer's life, that he is as unconscious
of, as the world are of the sweet-blowing flower of the desert, which
sheds her rich perfumes to the air, and her beauties to the heath, and
hath no beholder. The Lord's dealings with his people, as well in the
kingdom of providence as of grace, will form a huge volume to read over
in eternity, in which, like the earth helping the woman, we shall find
wonders to call forth love and praise to God and the Lamb. The timing of
mercies, the unexpected coming of them, the instruments by which they
have been brought, the means by which they have been accomplished, and,
what above all must endear them, the cause whence they come, the medium
through which they flow in the person of Jesus, and the covenant of
redemption in his blood; all these bring them home to the heart, with "a
joy unspeakable and full of glory," and richly fulfil that precious
promise of a covenant God in Christ, "Yea, I will rejoice over them to
do them good; and I will plant them in this land assuredly, with my
whole heart, and with my whole soul," Jer. xxxii. 41.</p>

24—Morning—Luke 16:5</h3>
<p>"How much owest thou unto my lord?"—Luke xvi. 5.</p>
<p>My soul, if this question, which the unjust steward put to his lord's
debtors, was put to thee concerning that immense debt which hath made
thee insolvent for ever, what wouldest thou answer? Never couldest thou
conceive the extent of it, much less think of paying the vast amount. A
debtor to free grace for thy very being; a debtor to free grace for thy
well-being; ten thousand talents, which the man in the parable owed his
master, would not be sufficient to reckon up what thou in reality owest
thy Lord, for even the common gifts of nature and of providence. But
when the calculation goeth on in grace, what archangel shall write down
the sum total? To the broken law of God, a bankrupt exposed to the
justice of God; to the dreadful penalty of everlasting death; to the
fears and alarms of a guilty conscience; to the worm that dieth not; to
the accusations of Satan, unable to answer one in a thousand! My soul,
how much owest thou unto thy Lord? Are there yet any other outstanding
debts? Oh yes, infinitely and beyond all these! What thinkest thou, my
soul, of Jesus? How much owest thou to the Father's love in giving; to
the Redeemer's love in coming; and to the Holy Ghost in making the whole
effectual to thy soul's joy; by which Jesus hath paid all thy debts,
cancelled all the demands of God's righteous law, silenced Satan,
answered justice; and not only redeemed thee out of the hands of
everlasting bondage, misery, and eternal death, but brought thee into
his everlasting kingdom of freedom, joy, and glory! Say, say, my soul,
how much owest thou unto thy Lord? Oh precious debt! ever increasing,
and yet everlastingly making happy in owing. Lord Jesus! I am thine, and
thy servant for ever; thou hast loosed my bonds.</p>

<p>To be sure they should. My soul, what would become of thee, in thine
exercises, hadst thou not had a God in Christ to fly to, and a God in
Christ to depend upon? Where wouldest thou find a bosom to pour all thy
griefs into, did not Jesus say to thee, as to the sorrowful father,
concerning his child, "Bring him hither to me?" Thou knowest, dearest
Lord, that there are circumstances into which I am cast, where none but
thyself can help; and even if help could be derived from man, yet who is
there to whom I could seek with a certainty of success? "My friends,"
saith Job, "have dealt deceitfully, like a brook;" like a brook which,
dried up by the summer heat, disappoints the traveller when he most
needs supply to slake his thirst. Oh for grace to centre all my desires
in thee, and to seek unto thee with all my concerns! Blessed Lord! let
that devout frame of David, in the wilderness, be the frame of my soul
in every wilderness dispensation, until I shall have passed through the
whole of the valley of Baca, and have attained to the everlasting
enjoyment of thee in heaven! "O God, thou art my God, early will I seek
thee; my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry
and thirsty land, where no water is," Psalm lxili. 1.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land

every slayer may flee thither."—Deut. xix. 3.</p>
<p>Sweet thought to my soul, that He who is the refuge is also the way
to every poor soul-slayer, who hath murdered his own soul by sin. And
who, my soul, could prepare thee this way, but God thy Father, who gave
both Jesus for the way, and Jesus for the refuge? And how hath God the
Spirit pointed to the way, cast up and prepared it, by taking up the
stumbling-blocks out of the way, as God saith of his people? Isa. lvii.
14. Is it not God the Holy Ghost that sets Jesus up, as Moses did the
serpent; points to his person, to his blood, to his righteousness, as
the sanctuary and the city of refuge to every poor sinner that is the
manslayer of his own soul? And if what the Jews have said be true, that
magistrates once a year made it their duty to have the roads examined,
lest any obstructions should arise to block the path of the poor
fugitive; and that they were obliged to set up a post at every turning
and avenue, with the word miklat—refuge, upon it, to direct the murderer
in his flight; well may ministers, every day, and all the day, stand in
the gates of the city, and in the high places of concourse, pointing to
Jesus, and crying out, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world!" Precious Lord Jesus! lo, I come to thee; thou art my
city of refuge—thou art the miklat of my soul! Under thee, and in thee,
I shall be safe. Cease, ye avengers of blood, your vain pursuit; Christ
hath taken me in. Thou shalt answer for me, Oh Lord my God.</p>

25—Evening—Zechariah 2:5</h3>
<p>"For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about,
and will be the glory in the midst of her."—Zech. ii. 5.</p>
<p>Precious promises these, my soul! and, like all the other promises of
our God, are "Yea and amen in Christ Jesus 1" Is the church, in this
wilderness-state, exposed to the ravages of Satan, who goeth about as a
roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour? then will God" be unto her a
wall," and that "of fire," which (like travellers in the desert, who
encircle themselves with fire against the attacks of wild beasts by
night) will keep her secure from all approaches. Doth the church, in her
poor circumstances, need comfort within? then will God in Christ be" the
glory in the midst of her." And hence, all around, within and without,
in every direction, and in every way, Jesus will be "the hiding-place
from the storm, and a covert from the tern-pest; and upon all the glory
shall be a defence." Look up then, my soul! What hast thou to fear? What
though the rains beat without, and poverty be felt within; he that is
"the wall of fire" can never be extinguished, and he that is "the glory
in the midst" will still shine upon thee, and fully satisfy all thy
need. Precious Lord Jesus! While thou art my defence, what host of foes
can I fear? And while thou art my glory, surely I shall never consider
my own humble circumstances. I will therefore say, with an exercised
believer of old, "At what time I am afraid, I will trust in thee!" Ps.
lvi. 3. To whom shall a child run, but to his father, in a season of
distress? And to whom shall a poor ransomed soul of Jesus look, but to
his Redeemer? And he will be both a shield and sun, "when the blast of
the terrible ones is as a storm against a wall." Sweet thought to hush
the soul asleep! And thou, my soul, take it with thee to thy bed, this
night: Jesus is unto thee as "a wall of fire round about," and he that
is in the midst of thee is" thy God, thy glory!"</p>

and earth? Jesus sweetly explained it himself, when declaring himself
possessing the key of David. Rev. iii. 7. And hath not God the Father
literally given all things into his hands? Is there any thing which
Jehovah hath kept back? Hath it not pleased the Father, that in him
should all fulness dwell? Is not Jesus the head over all things to the
church, which is his body? Is he not the Almighty Lord and Treasurer of
all things—grace here, glory hereafter? And is not our Jesus the
administrator of all things in the world, both of providence and grace?
My soul, is there aught remaining to hang upon Jesus? Pause, hast thou
hung upon him all the glory of thy salvation? Pause again, my soul. Is
all and every title given? Is there aught kept back? Is there any Achan
in the camp of thine heart? Forbid it, Lord. See to it, my soul, (for it
is thy life,) that thou art "hanging all the glory of the Father's house
upon Jesus?" Make him not only the Alpha, but the Omega also of thy
salvation. And as the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things
into his hands; so do thou come to him for all things, receive from him
all things, and ascribe to him all things, in the receipt of grace here,
and glory hereafter—that Christ may be all, and in all, to the glory of
God the Father. Amen.</p>

<p>"Jesus-wearied with his journey."—John iv. 6.</p>
<p>My soul, art thou wearied with the labours of the day, and glad that
the evening of rest is come? Look unto thy Lord! Behold Jesus wearied
with his journey. As part of the curse, this, among other consequences,
seized upon the Lord of life and glory, from the moment he became flesh:
"It behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren." All
the sinful frailties and infirmities of our poor nature; all the
calamities to which human life is exposed, in the thorns and thistles
which the earth is made to bring forth to man, and the dust of death,
into which, as Jesus spake by the spirit of prophecy, he knew Jehovah
would bring him (Ps. xxii. 15.) these were the very conditions to which
the Redeemer subjected himself, in the days of his flesh, when" he was
made sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
of God in him:" and hence his whole life was a life of weariness,
sorrows, and affliction. And he not only felt in himself the common
wants, and was exposed to the common miseries of nature; but, living as
in an hospital of woe, amidst the sick and wounded, he participated in
every groan he heard, and, as the prophet spake of him," himself bare
our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows.'' And what can bring relief to
the pilgrimage tears of the redeemed, or so sweetly soothe the wearied
frames of his people both in body and soul, as looking unto Jesus?
Precious Lord! Do I see thee wearied with thy journey; and shall I
repine at mine? Hadst thou not where to lay thine head; and shall I feel
hurt if the world refuse me a lodging? Was the Son of God, though rich,
yet condescending to be poor: and though the Lord of life and glory, yet
"a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;" subjecting himself to
hunger, and thirst, and weariness, and affliction; tempted, and
buffeted, and despised; yea, "a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and
the outcast of the people?" Oh Lord! how sweetly accommodating is thy
blessed example to all the tried and trying circumstances of life! Grant
me, dear Lord, as oft as sorrow, weariness, disappointment, and any of
the afflicting dis. pensations incident to human life come upon me,
grant me to be looking unto thee; and I would say, "Jesus was wearied
with his journey!"</p>

<p>"He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted:
neither hath he hid his face from him: but when he cried unto him he
heard him."—Ps. xxii. 24.</p>
<p>My soul, behold Jesus, the Lamb of God, in this sweet scripture. Is
it not said of him, that in the days of his flesh "he offered up strong
crying and tears, and was heard in that he feared? Though he were a Son,
yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered." And was Jesus
the Holy One, the afflicted One, also? Was he truly so, when he bore thy
sins? And was this the time to which the scripture refers, when God the
Father had respect to the sufferings of Jesus, and neither despised nor
abhorred them? Did the Father behold him then through the whole as the
sinner's Surety, and graciously accept Jesus and the church in him? Oh
then, my soul, think of this in all thy trials and afflictions. Carry
all thy sins and sorrows to the throne. Jesus knows them all, sees them
all, nay, appoints them all. He is always looking upon thee, and
presenting thee in himself to the Father. And depend upon it, as thy
afflictions are not only known by him, but appointed by him, he will
measure out no more to thee than he will sanctify. And so far from
abhorring or despising thy affliction, he will with every sorrow grant
support, and with every temptation make a way to escape. Go then, my
soul, cast all thy care upon him; for he careth for thee.</p>

27—Evening—2 Timothy 4:10</h3>
<p>"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."—2 Tim.
iv. 10.</p>
<p>Was this the same Demas of whom the apostle spake, Coloss. iv. 14? I
should hope not. But if it was, it becomes no proof of a man's falling
from grace. The apostle no where speaks of this man as being a partaker
of grace. And a man cannot fall from grace, who never possessed grace.
Professors there may be, who follow the means of grace, as Demas
followed Paul; but the world, as in his instance, is still in their
heart. But, my soul, what the apostle hath said of him, may well serve
for an instruction to thee. If Jesus, and the love of Jesus, with all
his sweetness, beauty, suitableness, and delight, be come into thine
heart, then will the love of this present world be gone out. Both cannot
dwell nor live together in the same heart. A believer in Christ Jesus
will carry with him his affection to Jesus even into the world, wherever
the business or duties of life, in the honest maintenance of himself and
family, necessarily call him. Is he constrained to go to the
market-place, or engaged in the labours of his hands at home, still the
savour of Jesus's name is upon his soul; and fellowship with heaven is
carried on, while intercourse with the earth and earthly things engage
his hands. "Holiness unto the Lord shall be upon the bells of the
horses," Zech. xiv. 20. that is, every thing shall carry with it a
memorandum for the sanctified use of all providences. When a soul hath
once made Jesus his portion, his desires are to trace Jesus in every
thing, and to enjoy Jesus in every thing; and to say, with one of old,"
Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my right
hand," Ps. lxxiii. 23. My soul, what saith thine experience to this
statement? If, Demas-like, thou lovest this present world, thine
enjoyments, even in religion, will rise or fall, and be as the world
countenanceth or frowneth upon it, like those springs of water which
have a subterraneous communication with the sea; if the tide flow, they
rise high; if the tide be at ebb, they will ebb also. But if Jesus, the
living water, be the source and fountain of all thy love and enjoyments,
the tides of this world will have no effect upon the streams of thy
delight; "the water (which Jesus hath given thee) will be in thee a well
of water springing up to everlasting life!"</p>

destruction of the old world by water: "I do set my bow in the cloud,
and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And
I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant
between God and every living creature of all flesh." And was not this
rainbow round the throne which John saw, to tell the church of Jesus, on
whom the Father is always looking, to remember his everlasting covenant
of grace? And what doth it say but this, there shall be no more a
deluge, nor floods of vengeance poured out upon the sinner that believes
in Jesus. He looks to Christ, while the Father beholds Christ: he trusts
in Jesus, whom the Father hath trusted with his honour: he accepts Jesus
as the whole of the covenant, in whom the Father beholds the whole of
the covenant fulfilled. Help me, Lord, in the view of every renewed
token of the rainbow in the heavens, to connect with it the promise of
Jehovah to his poor redeemed upon earth. Yes, blessed Lord, there is a
rainbow round about the throne; and Christ is the bow which Jehovah hath
set in the cloud. On him, my soul, gaze and feast thy ravished eyes. On
him thy God and Father looks, and is well pleased.</p>

<p>"Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
prey."—Psalm 76:4.</p>
<p>My soul, the more thou turnest over the word of God in inquiries
after thy beloved, the more writ thou be astonished at the relation
given of him in his excellency and glory. By every thing that can
represent the adorable Redeemer, in his beauty, loveliness, grace,
fulness, and all-sufficiency, whether considered in his absolute, his
comparative, his relative, or his official glory, or in his glory as the
head of his body, the church, the fulness of Him that filleth all in
all; thou art constrained, with the church to cry out at every view,
"Yea, he is altogether lovely; the chief among ten thousand." There is
somewhat particularly striking to this amount in this verse for thine
evening portion: "Thou art more glorious and excellent than the
mountains of prey." Yes! it must be so: for when the soul hath found
Jesus, like the merchant-man seeking goodly pearls, having found this
one of immense and incalculable value, the soul gladly parts with every
thing beside, to attain it. Hence one of old, having got possession of
Jesus, cries out with holy joy and rapture, "I rejoice at thy word as
one that findeth great spoil;" Psalm cxix. 162. In life men become
mountains of prey to one another; and too frequently find, to their
sorrow, that the pursuit and chase is folly, and the end of the game,
vanity and vexation of spirit. But in following thee, thou blessed
Jesus, every renewed discovery of thee is glorious, and every new
attainment most excellent indeed. In thy person, offices, character,
relations, thou art most glorious and excellent. Thou art a glorious
Redeemer, a glorious head of thy church and people; a glorious husband,
brother, friend; a glorious prophet, priest, and king, in thy Zion. And
when I behold thee in all these relative excellencies, and can and do
know thee, and enjoy thee, and call thee mine, under every one of them,
surely I may well take up the language of this sweet scripture, and
say," Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
prey?"</p>

<p>Do I not see Jesus and his fulness here? His giving out never
ceaseth, until we have no more empty vessels to receive. And surely it
is but proper the oil of grace should stay, when there are no more souls
to be supplied. Pity indeed would it be, that any thing so precious
should be spilt on the ground. My soul, art thou not poor as this poor
woman? Is the creditor come to take thee for bondage? Cry mightily to
Jesus, the Lord God of the prophets. And wilt thou borrow vessels to
receive his bounty? Borrow not a few; for every vessel must fail before
that Jesus fails. Hast thou filled all? See then that thy Almighty
Creditor is paid from Jesus's bounty; for he hath paid all thy debt: and
see that thou live henceforth on Jesus's fulness. Oh bountiful Lord, let
me learn from hence sweet lessons of faith. There is no narrowness in
thee, but all fulness. All thou hast, moreover, is for sinners. And,
precious Lord, art thou not glorified in giving out to sinners? Is it
not thy glory, thy delight so to do? Art thou not pleased when sinners
come to thee? Oh for grace to come to thee, and to know and believe that
it is thy glory and thy pleasure to receive them. Indeed, indeed thou
keepest open house, an open hand, an open heart. Lord, give me daily,
hourly, to come empty to thee to be filled; with grace here, and glory
hereafter.</p>

they ask of me the ordinances of justice: they take delight in
approaching to God."—Isaiah lviii. 2.</p>
<p>My soul, when thou readest a scripture like this, which, as far as
the outward observance of religion goes, seems to carry a fair face, it
may be well to consider the wretched delusion under which such men
labour. The world, indeed, calls them very good sort of people; but the
Lord speaks most awfully concerning them. Persons of this complexion do
not venture to say, that they hope to be found before God without sin:
for they will tell you, that they know" we have all sinned and come
short of God's glory:" but their faith is, that for their sins they have
endeavoured to repent, and made amends; and they hope Christ will make
up the deficiency. They have not been so bad as many others; and in
point of doing, they have done a great deal more: so that if they do not
go to heaven, they know not who will. As to ordinances, as this
scripture represents, they profess to seek the Lord daily, as a nation
that does righteousness, and that takes delight in approaching to God.
"Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? Wherefore have
we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?" Mark, my soul, the
awful feature of such characters, and behold what is the leading
principle in the religion of many who are not openly profane. Here are
no cries for sin, no concern for the sufferings of Jesus; no inquiries
for redemption in his blood; neither any heartfelt acquaintance with the
teachings and humblings of the soul by the Holy Ghost. Doth God bid his
sent servants to cry aloud, and spare not, in shewing his people their
transgressions, and "the house of Jacob" their sins? And can such as
these be found righteous in his sight? Oh! for the warning voice, to bid
them flee from the wrath to come! Had! the power of persuasion, I should
say, 'My poor deluded, self-righteous brother! rouse from this carnal
security and vain confidence. If salvation be of works, then is it no
more of faith. And if any thing but the blood of Christ can cleanse from
sin, or any thing but file righteousness of Christ justify the sinner,
then must all the threatenings of the gospel be void, and all the
promises be altered.' Blessed be the Lord that teacheth thee, my soul,
to profit, and hath fully, finally, and completely established thee in
this decisive truth, that" there is salvation in no other but in Jesus
only: neither is there any other name under heaven given among men
whereby we must be saved."</p>

30—Morning—Exodus 12:14</h3>
<p>"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial."—Exodus xii. 14.</p>
<p>It is blessed to end the month, and end every day, as we would wish
and desire to end life, blessing and praising God in Christ; rising from
the table of divine bounties, and thanking the great Master of the
feast. Pause, my soul, and see whether, in the past month, such hath
been thine experience of sovereign grace and unmerited mercies, that
thou canst now set up thine Ebenezer, and mark this day for a memorial.
What visits hath Jesus made to thee, my soul; and how hath thine heart
been drawn out after him? Hath the Father, as well as the Son, come and
made his abode with thee? Hath the Holy Ghost, the glorious inhabitant
in the souls and bodies of his people, manifested his continued presence
to thee? This day is indeed a memorial, if, in summing up the wonderful
account of divine manifestations of divine love in providence and grace,
during the month now nearly closed, and the years already passed, thou
canst mark down the blessed enumeration. And will not my Lord, while the
day is not passed, and yet remains to be added to the month, will he not
make it memorable by some renewed favour? Oh, for some new visits from
Father, Son, and Spirit—this morning, this day, and ail the day! As long
as I live I would have my soul going forth in exercises of faith and
love upon the person of Emanuel, that I may carefully mark down the
numberless instances of it. Here, I would say, Jesus visited me; here it
was he met me, here he shewed me his loves, and made the place and day
ever memorable by his grace.</p>

30—Evening—John 9:4</h3>
<p>"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work."—John ix. 4.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this sweet scripture, and these sweet words of
thy Lord! Look at Jesus, even thy Jesus, who, in the service of
Mediator, as God's servant, had work to do in his day, as thou hast in
thine. And Oh! what a day was his! Every portion of it filled with good!
Now, my soul, the night of this present day is come; and the night of
the whole day of thy life upon earth will shortly follow; it may come
this very night; for nearly as the month is ended, thy life may end
before it: and though death come not this very night, it cannot be far
off, and may be near indeed. How then stands thy great account? Take
down thy memorandums, as merchants do their ledger at certain seasons,
to ascertain their stock; and review thine experience. Hath Jesus filled
up every page? Hast thou the several items of his grace, and love, and
bounty? Canst thou tell of Him that sent thee into the world, as he
saith his Father sent him? John xvii. 18. Canst thou call to mind, from
the first Bethel visit of his love, to the present hour, how he hath
borne thee, and carried thee as on eagle's wings? And though it would
tire the arm of an angel to write down the vast account of his mercy and
grace, and though in thy poor forgetful heart, thousands, and ten
thousands of instances have passed away, like traces on the water, and
thou canst remember them no more; yet in looking back upon the whole,
canst thou say, "Jesus is mine, and I am his?" Oh! the unspeakable
felicity of thy summing up months, and days, and years, when the night
cometh that no man can work. Precious Lord Jesus! thou hast indeed done
all for me, and wrought all in me; thou hast made, and thou dost bear.
It is thou that formed me from the womb, and now hast made me in
thyself: thou hast redeemed me, and washed me from my sins in thy blood;
borne with me in all my unworthiness, and carried me in all my sorrows!
Into thy gracious hands, Lord, I desire to fall this night, and every
night, and in the night of death; under the blessed assurance, that"
when my heart shall faint, and my strength shall fail, thou wilt be the
strength of my heart, and my portion for ever." Amen.</p>

1—Morning—Genesis 49:10</h3>
<p>"Shiloh."—Gen. xlix 10.</p>
<p>Precious name of the Lord Jesus! How blessed hath it been in all ages
to thy people. Oh Lord, make it as ointment poured forth this morning to
my soul! Both Jews and Christians alike agree in it, that it belongs
only to the Messiah. And how then is it that they do not see Christ in
it, even our Jesus, who suffered under Pontius Pilate, and died, as
Caiaphas predicted the expediency, that one man should die for the
people, and that he should fulfil the dying patriarch's prediction, by
gathering together in one the children of God which were scattered
abroad? That Jesus answered to Jacob's prediction, and none but Jesus
ever did, is evident from their own testimony:—"We have a law," said
they to Pilate, "and by that law he ought to die." Now, then, they
themselves hereby confessed that as Jacob prophesied, the Lawgiver was
not departed from Israel when Christ came. And when they added, "We have
no king but Caesar," certain it was, from their own testimony, the
sceptre was gone out of the family of Judah, when the heathen emperor
was king. Think of these evidences, my soul, and feast thyself upon the
precious name of thy Shiloh. Thy Jesus, thy Shiloh, thy Almighty
Deliverer, is come. He is both thy Lawgiver and thy Law-fulfiller; thy
God and thy King, who sprang out of Judah. Oh thou glorious Shiloh! let
my soul be gathered to thee, to live upon thee and to thee; and do thou,
Lord, arise out of Zion, and when the fulness of the gentiles is
completed, let both Jew and gentile be gathered into one fold, of which
be thou the ever-living, ever-loving, ever-governing Shiloh, to bless
them in thyself for ever. Amen.</p>

1—Evening—Habakkuk 3:17, 18</h3>
<p>"Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in
the vines, the labour of the olive shall fail, and the field shall yield
no meat, the flocks shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be
no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the
God of my salvation!"—Habakkuk iii. 17, 18.</p>
<p>See, my soul, in the prophet's example, the blessedness of living
above creature enjoyments, by living upon Creator fulness. Here is a
sun, which never goes down! Here is a fountain, whose streams can never
dry up! He that lives upon creature excellency, will want both food and
comfort when that excellency dies, for they must die with it, when the
period of its flourishing is over. But the soul that draws all from
Jesus, the God of his salvation, will have Jesus and leis salvation to
live upon, and to be an everlasting source, when nature, in all its
varieties, ceases to supply. My soul, what are thy resources for a day
of famine? Canst thou join issue with the prophet? If blasting, or
mildew, or frost, shall nip the fig-tree of its blossom; both the vine
and the olive fail; yea, if the staff of life, as well as the sweets of
life, should all be gone; hast thou Jesus to live upon; canst thou
rejoice in him, when there is nothing else left to rejoice in; and call
him thine, and the God of thy salvation, when none will own thee, and
thou hast none beside him to own? They say that music upon the waters
always sounds best. Be this so or not, yet the melody of the soul is
certainly sweetest when nature is out of tune, if the believer can take
his harp from the willow, and sing aloud on the tribulated waters of
sorrow, to the God of ' salvation. And this is a song never out of
season, but has peculiar joy in the note, when from a new-strung heart,
the believer sings it of the God of his salvation, and addresses it to
the God of his salvation. Blessed Lord Jesus! give me grace, like the
prophet, so to sing and so to triumph, that since, lose what I may, I
cannot lose thee, while thy creature comforts remain, I may enjoy them,
from enjoying thee in them: and when all are taken away, still, having
thee for my portion, may I sing aloud with the prophet, though all
earthly enjoyments cease, "I will still rejoice in the Lord, I will joy
in the God of my salvation."</p>

2—Morning—Song of Solomon 3:1</h3>
<p>"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth"—Song iii.
1.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this account which the church gives of herself,
and see whether such be thine exercises. It is night indeed in the soul
whenever Christ is absent, or his presence not enjoyed. And though,
blessed be God, the believer's interest in Christ varies riot, yet his
joy in the sense of safety is not always the same. Though it be the bed
of affliction, or the bed of sickness, it is not the bed of carnal
security, when the soul seeks Jesus. We cannot be said to be in a cold,
lifeless, and indifferent state, while Jesus is sought for. It may be
night indeed, it may be a dark season; yet, nevertheless, when we can
say, "With my soul have I sought thee in the night, yea, with my spirit
within me will I seek thee early:" surely, this earnestness implies
grace, and love, and desire, in lively exercise. However dull, stupid,
and unprofitable, at times, ordinances and means of grace may seem;
still grace, like the live coal under the embers, is not gone out nor
extinguished. Him whom my soul loveth frequently breaks out, and plainly
shews that Jesus still lives and reigns within. Oh precious Lord, thou
art still the lovely one, the chief one, and the fairest among ten
thousand. Be thou all in. all, the hope of glory.</p>

2—Evening—Luke 7:42</h3>
<p>"And when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both."—Luke
vii. 42.</p>
<p>My soul, nothing can be more grateful, and commendatory to the state
of thine insolvency; than the recollection of what thy God and Saviour
hath taught in this beautiful parable; that the debtor of five hundred
pence, and the debtor of fifty, being both equally incapable of
discharging the respective claims upon there, are equally considered as
objects of mercy, and are therefore both alike forgiven. And this,
indeed, is the distinguishing property of grace. It is totally distinct
from merit; yea, in direct opposition to it. Hadst thou the least
pretensions to divine favour, or couldest thou have put forth the least
helping hand towards thine own salvation; grace then would have been no
more grace. The frank forgiveness of all debt, carries with it the
plainest testimony of man's total helplessness, and the sovereign
freedom of divine love. And hence, when the sinner, of every description
and character, is brought into this glorious privilege of redemption,
the whole result is "to the praise of the glory of his grace, who hath
made us accepted in the Beloved." What a beautiful and interesting view
is this of the gospel of Jesus! It is full, and free, and suited to
every case, and answering to the state and circumstances of every poor
sinner. For as all have sinned and come short of God's glory; so all,
being unable to make the smallest restitution, are equally objects
suited to divine mercy: and, whatever other causes operate, certain it
is, that the greatness or smallness of the debt, in a state of total
insolvency, becomes no bar to pardon. So runs the charter of grace, and
the proclamation from the court of heaven. Let all that are poor, and
insolvent, and helpless, and conscious of their lost state, come alike
to the footstool of the mercy-seat. The Son of God will have his court
surrounded with such; and every one to whom his free salvation is
welcome, that poor creature, be his circumstances what they may, shall
be welcome to take it; whether him that oweth ten thousand talents, or
whether him that oweth fifty: having nothing, either of them, to pay,
the Lord frankly forgives both! Oh! the unsearchable riches of grace!
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!</p>

3—Morning—Romans 3:22</h3>
<p>"Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ
unto all, and, upon all them that believe; for there is no
difference."—Romans iii. 22.</p>
<p>Here, my soul, is a morning portion for thee! Surely here is enough
for a morning portion for poor believing souls to live upon to all
eternity. Mark, my soul, what is here said. That righteousness of the
Lord Jesus Christ, which he wrought out for his church, is the
righteousness of God: for, as he was God as well as man, his
righteousness was, to all intents and purposes, the righteousness of
God. Now the sin of Adam, and the sins of all Adam's children, put the
whole together, form but the sins of creatures; consequently the
righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ is more than an equivalent, a
more full payment than their debt can demand, because it is the
righteousness of the Creator. Sweet thought! for God is more honoured by
Christ's obedience, than dishonoured by our disobedience. And observe,
my soul, how this righteousness is the church of Christ's, namely, by
faith; "it is unto all, and upon all them that believe." It is received
by faith. The scripture language of this unspeakable mercy is, that as
it was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, so it shall be imputed unto
us also, if we believe on Him that raised up our Lord Jesus from the
dead. This is another delightful portion of this precious verse. Neither
is this all-for, as if to encourage the poorest, weakest, and most timid
believer, this righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ
unto all, and upon all that believe, "hath no difference" in its blessed
effect. All partakers of it are alike partakers. By him, that is by
Christ, the scripture saith, "all that believe are justified from all
things." Acts xiii. 39. So that, though the faith of an Abraham or of a
Peter might have been vastly greater than that of the timid Ananias, or
the poor man that came to Christ for his son, saying, "Lord, I believe,
help thou mine unbelief;" yet the justification by Christ, to all, is
one and the same-"it is to all, and upon all that believe; for there is
no difference." Oh precious righteousness of the God-man Christ
Jesus.</p>

3—Evening—Hebrews 9:17</h3>
<p>"For a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of
no strength at all whilst the testator liveth."—Heb. ix. 17.</p>
<p>Precious Lord Jesus! and was it needful that thou shouldest die, that
the rich legacies of thy will might be paid thy children, and thy
spouse, the church? Was the testament in thy blood of no force until
thou hadst finished redemption by expiring on the cross And hast thou
now confirmed the whole, by this gracious act of thine, when dying "the
just for the unjust, to bring us to God?" Sit down, my soul, this
evening, and ponder over the unequalled love of thy dear Redeemer. Jesus
died, and thereby gave validity and efficacy to his will. Now therefore
it is of force. Now the large estate of "an inheritance, incorruptible,
and undefiled, and which fadeth not away," which Jesus hath purchased by
his blood, is eternally and everlastingly secured. Yea, the will hath
since his death, been proved in the court of heaven, and Jesus is gone
thither to see every legacy paid; yea, Jesus becomes the executor and
administrator of the whole, and ever liveth for this express purpose. So
that it is impossible for any of his poor relations, and their claims
through him, ever to be forgotten or overlooked. Pause over this view of
this most interesting subject. Shall the great ones of the earth, the
rich and the mighty, be so anxious over their legacies from one another,
as never to lose an estate for want of enquiry, when their rich
relations die; and wilt not thou, my soul, now thy rich relation is
dead, and liveth again, and hath left thee the most blessed of all
inheritances, wilt not thou seek after it, and be anxious for the full
possession of it? Dost thou know thyself to be indeed a part of Christ's
body, the church, the Lamb's wife, and, by adoption and grace, a child
of God, and a joint-heir with Christ; and wilt thou not see that. thy
legacy be fully paid? Surely, thou hast already taken out a probate of
thy Lord's will from the chancery of heaven, the book of life, and
therefore mayest well look for all the testamentary effects. Precious
Lord Jesus! I hear thee speak, and well do I remember the words; "Peace
I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth,
give I unto you!" Oh the unspeakable mercy of being thus related to the
Lord Jesus Christ! by which, my soul, thou hast every legacy needful for
thy present peace paid in part; and the whole reversionary interest of
that immense estate in heaven shall be fully paid when thou comest of
age, and thou shalt enter upon the possession of it, in the presence of
thy Lord, and sit down with him in the everlasting enjoyment of it for
ever!</p>

<p>"Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither
thou goest; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I
have spoken to thee of."—Gen. xxviii. 15.</p>
<p>Here is a promise to Jacob, and not to Jacob only, personally
considered, but to Jacob's seed. For the apostle Paul was commissioned
by the Holy Ghost to tell the church of Jesus, that we, as Isaac was,
are the children of promise. Hence this, like all other promises in
Christ Jesus, is yea and amen. Pause, then, my soul, and ask thyself
what hath the Lord spoken to thee of? Hath he met with thee in Bethel,
as he found Jacob? And hath he there spoken unto thee? How wilt thou
know? Very plainly. Jesus hath met with thee, hath indeed spoken unto
thee, if so be thou hast seen thine own unworthiness and sinfulness by
nature and by practice; and if thou hast seen the King in his beauty,
even Jesus in his own glory, suitableness, and all-sufficiency, as a
Saviour; and inclined thine heart by his grace to believe in him, to
depend upon him, and to live to him and his glory. What sayest thou, my
soul, to these things? Is this promise made to Jacob and his seed thine?
If so, live upon Jesus, and plead the fulfilment of it daily, hourly.
Say to him, my soul, Lord, what hast thou spoken to me of, but mercy,
pardon, peace, and grace, with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus?
And what have I to depend upon, or what indeed can I need more, but thy
promise and the great Promiser? Yes, Lord Jesus, I do depend, I do
believe. Surely thou wilt never leave whom thou hast once loved; and
therefore thou wilt not leave me, until thou hast done that which thou
hast spoken of in grace here, and wilt complete in glory hereafter.</p>

<p>"Man did eat angels' food."—Psalm lxxviii. 25.</p>
<p>Yes, so he did, when the Lord rained down manna upon the people in
the wilderness. But, my soul, what hast thou eaten, now thou hast. been
at the table of thy Lord? What did Jesus there entertain thee with?
"Wonder, O heavens, and be astonished, O earth!" Thou hast feasted upon
the body and blood of Christ! and this is food which angels never ate,
neither was such a feast ever prepared for them. Pause over this blessed
subject, for it is enough to call up the wonder, praise, and love of all
thine intellectual faculties for ever! When man fell, the earth was made
to bring forth thorns and thistles; this was all the inheritance then
left us; man was to eat bread in the sweat of the brow. But Jesus
interposeth, and removes the curse, in being made a "curse for us." The
curse being removed by him and his cross, the earth is made to bring
forth its blessings, and "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and
oil td make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's
heart." But after this, who should have thought, yea, what imagination
could have conceived an idea so wonderful and surpassingly rich in
mercy, that Jesus should become the. bread of life, and the water of
life, to his people; and feed them, as an heavenly pelican, with his own
blood! Think, my soul, of thy privileges; thou art unworthy, of the most
common blessings of thine own table, which thy Lord hath provided; and
yet Jesus feasts thee with the choicest of blessings of his. Thou hast
merited nothing but "the cup of trembling;" but Jesus giveth thee the
"cup of salvation." Thou art unworthy to gather up .the crumbs that fall
from thy Lord's table; but Jesus seats thee at his table with himself,
and bids thee eat and drink, "yea, drink abundantly, O beloved." Lord, I
fall down under the deepest selfabasement at the recollection of thy
grace and my undeservings. Oh thou precious, precious Jesus! this is not
angels' food indeed, but above angels' food; yea, divine food; thy body
and blood! "Lord! evermore give me this bread!"</p>

<p>Mark this, my soul, in all thy goings forth; look out for thy
gracious, glorious Forerunner, and see whether the same going before
thee of thy Lord hath not been from everlasting. Was it not Jesus that
was set up as the Head of his people from everlasting? Did he not then
go before them, when he went forth for the salvation of his people? In
the council of peace did he not go before them; not only before we knew
our need, but before we had a being? In all his covenant engagements, as
the Surety of his people, he went before them. And in all his offices,
characters, and relations, he was preventing us with the blessings of
his goodness. And in the personal salvation of every individual of his
redeemed, was not Jesus beforehand in quickening, illuminating,
redeeming mercy? "If we love him, is it not because he first loved us?"
And what is it now? Do not his mercies go before our prayers? and before
we call, doth not Jesus answer? And will it not be so during the whole
day of grace, even to the eternal day of glory? Precious Jesus, surely
thou art going before me into Galilee. Oh for grace to follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth. And do thou, Lord, walk with me, and talk with
me, as thou didst to the disciples in the way, and make thyself known
unto me in continual manifestations, and in breaking of bread, and in
prayer.</p>

<p>"They made me keeper of the vineyards, but mine own vineyard have I

<p>My soul, now the day is over, sit down, and look back on the
employments of it. What a day hath it been? What portion of it hath been
engaged in the service of thy Lord, and the improvement of thy soul? How
wholly occupied in the busy and imperious demands of the world, the care
of the body, and in procuring the bread that perisheth! Surely the
complaint of the church is thine also. Keeper of the vineyards of
others, thine own goeth to waste! And of what avail, in the path of
grace, if though occupied by a thousand things in the aid of others,
thou art making no progress in the heavenly road by thine own soul? Are
not the peace of thy life, and the glorious expectation of a better, to
be advanced in the knowledge and enjoyment of Jesus? If I lose sight of
thee, thou dear Immanuel; if the lively actings of faith upon thee be
remitted, will the recollection of attention to others give assurance or
comfort? If I lose all that sweet personal communion and fellowship with
thee, which is the very life of the soul, and receive none of thy
private visits, what signifies the best and most successful public
usefulness in thy church, and among thy people? I do indeed rejoice to
say or do any thing which may minister to others in the knowledge of my
Lord; but God forbid, that, like the post to the traveller, I be found
merely to direct, but never move a step myself. Rather, blessed Jesus,
be it my portion to be like the star to the wise men, which not only
lighted to Christ, but went with them, and before them, until it came
and stood over where the young child was. Oh! then, with the church,
under the same complaint, let me cry out, as she did "Tell me, O thou
whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest; where thou makest thy flock to
rest at noon; for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the

<p>My soul, the Holy Ghost hath marked this verse with Selah; therefore,
pray observe it. You see the argument for trust, because God, that is,
the Elohim, is a refuge. Yes, God the Father is a refuge, in his
covenant engagements, word, oath, promises. God the Son is a refuge, in
his suretyship engagements, in his perfect righteousness, in his
blood-cleansing, sin-atoning death and salvation, and in all his
securities of grace here, and glory hereafter. God the Holy Ghost is a
refuge, in all his blessed offices, characters, and relations; by which
he undertakes and fulfils all the purposes of salvation, in the
glorifying of the Father and the Son, to every poor believer's joy and
comfort. And wilt thou not, my soul, then trust in this glorious Elohim?
Wilt thou not pour out thyself before him, and trust in him at all
times, at any time, at every time? Nay, wilt thou not call upon all the
people to this soul-rewarding service, and tell them of his grace and
glory? "Come hither, I would say, and hearken, all ye that fear God, and
I will tell you what he hath done for my soul." Oh let us magnify his

<p>"By faith, Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the
children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."—Heb. xi.
22.</p>
<p>See, my soul, the triumphs of faith in this lively instance of the
patriarch Joseph! How many have I known, who, though they have given up
their souls, with full assurance of faith, into the hands of Jesus,
conscious of an interest in him, and of redemption in his blood; have,
nevertheless, felt fears and alarms for the moment in which the soul
separates from the body, and have wanted faith "concerning their bones!"
Look at the patriarch when dying, and learn from him whence to derive
strength and comfort for every emergency, and for every concern. "By
faith:" is the one universal charm. Jesus is in every thing, and for
every thing the believer can possibly need or require, all the way home;
in death, as in life; concerning the bones, or concerning the soul. In
him the soul goes forth boldly from the body at the hour of death; and
in him the body as safely and securely reposeth in the grave. The
believer hears, or may hear, the voice of Jesus, in terms like those he
spake to Jacob: "Fear not to go down into Egypt; I will go down with
thee:" so Jesus speaks to his people: "Fear not to go down into the
grave; I will go down with thee!" Hence, by faith, like the patriarch,
the believer feels a holy confidence in Jesus concerning his bones. And
who can feel concern, when, by faith, all is committed unto Jesus? Who
would fear concerning their bones, if Jesus make the grave, and appoint
the sepulchre where, and when they are to be deposited; yea, inters the
remains, visits and watches over the dust of his saints with more care
than the goldsmith doth the golden particles, which he suffereth not the
least air to blow away? Precious Jesus! be it my portion like Joseph,
when dying, to have the same lively actings of faith as he had in thee,
(and sure I am, he had not greater cause for the full exercise of this
principle than believers now,) and may I then enjoy with equal, yea,
with increasing strength, this blessed assurance in thee, and by the
same faith that hath carried me through many sharp trials in the past,
be carried through this last and trying conflict. Lord! let me die, as I
have lived, believing; yea, triumphing in believing. And when the earth
gives way under my feet, and every object of sense is sinking also, then
may my soul go forth as the jewel from the casket, in all the joy which
a soul in Christ must find; and in the last act of the holy triumph of
faith leave all with thee "concerning my bones!"</p>

7—Morning—Titus 2:13</h3>
<p>"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ."—Titus ii. 13.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over these sweet and solemn words. Is Jesus my hope?
Surely then it is a blessed hope; for all blessings are in him. Art thou
looking for his appearing? Pause, for the thought is solemn. How shall I
know? Suppose this moment the trumpet of the archangel was to sound,
"Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment;" my soul, art thou ready? Pause
once more. Do I long for Jesus's appearing now, in the conversion of
every poor sinner? Do I rejoice to hear, at any time; that a soul is
born to God? If so, is not this looking for his appearing? Again—Do I
long for Jesus appearing in the after-manifestations of his grace to the
souls of the people?—for this is to rejoice with them that do rejoice,
and to prove a family interest. Again-Is Jesus precious to me, and do I
long for the renewal of his visits, as the earth longeth for the rising
sun? When I read his word, sing his praise, call upon his name, mingle
in the congregation, go to his table; is his appearing upon all these
occasions precious now, and are his love-tokens sweeter to my soul than
honey, and the honey-comb? If, my soul, thou canst bear a cheerful
testimony to these things, and, canst truly call them blessed now;
surely the hope of Jesus's second coming is blessed also, and thou canst
well subscribe to the apostle's words; for his appearing being now
gracious, will then be glorious, in the appearing of the great God, and
our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

7—Evening—Habakkuk 2:3</h3>
<p>"For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely
come, it will not tarry."—Hab. ii. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, there is always a set time to favour Zion. It may not be so
early as we could wish; it may not come at the time we look for it; yea,
it may be deferred until our impatience hath given over the very
expectation of it; nevertheless, "it will surely come; it will not
tarry." We are like children, who wish to gather the fruit before it is
ripe; but there is no haste with God. He stops until the mercy, intended
to be given us, is fully prepared, and our souls as fully ready to
receive it. And what endears the mercy (be it what it may) yet more, is,
that from everlasting it hath been appointed. "The vision is for an
appointed time." So that, however tedious it may seem in coming, it will
neither go a moment beyond the appointment, nor come a moment before:
and when it arrives, it will explain wherefore it came not sooner, by
shewing how suited and seasonable it is now in its coming. My soul, let
this sweet scripture be ever uppermost in thy recollection, to help thee
on in seasons of exercise. God's appointments are sure; never shall his
people be disappointed in them, nor of them; come they will, and at the
very hour. Israel was to be a certain time in Egypt; when that time was
accomplished, we are told, "The self-same night the Lord brought them
out, with their armies." Exactly the same in Babylon, and exactly the
same deliverance. So, my soul, in all thine exercises, the hour is
marked: "The vision is for an appointed time." Though it tarry much
beyond thy expectation, it cannot tarry beyond the Lord's appointment.
Oh! for grace, upon every occasion, to follow the advice of David: "Wait
on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart:
wait, I say, on the Lord," Ps. xxvii. 14.</p>

8—Morning—Luke 24:24</h3>
<p>"But him they saw not."—Luke xxiv. 24.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, what is here said. Though Jesus sought out his
disciples in the morning of his resurrection, and was found of them that
sought him not; yet many saw him not, while he was thus gracious to many
that looked not for him. So is it now. Many, like those women, have seen
the sepulchre, as it were, of Jesus, heard his word; nay, many saw his
body when on earth, yet saw not God in Christ in him. "The grace of
God," saith the apostle, "hath appeared unto all, men;" that is, the
gospel grace is preached in common before believers and unbelievers; but
believers only see Jesus as the wisdom and the power of God for
salvation; of others it may be said, as here, "but him they see not." Oh
precious Jesus, give me to see thee as the Sent and Sealed of the
Father, that my soul may have such a saving sight and knowledge of thee
as the apostle had, which flesh and blood cannot reveal, but the Father
only which is in heaven. Oh heavenly Father! give me the Spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of thy dear Son; and do by me as
by Paul, reveal thy Son in me.</p>

8—Evening—Jeremiah 35:2</h3>
<p>"The house of the Rechabites."—Jer. xxxv. 2.</p>
<p>My soul, as the prophet had his commission from the Lord, to go unto
the house of the Rechabites, and the Holy Ghost hath been pleased to
have the event of the visit recorded; do thou go down to it also, and
see what instructions thou canst gather there, under his gracious
teachings, for thine evening meditation. The house of the Rechabites
drank no wine. And was not this to intimate the law of the Nazarites?
Surely there was a reference, in this prohibition, to the one glorious
Nazarite, even Jesus! The Rechabites had no fixed dwelling-place, but
lived in moveable tents; and believers in Jesus, like their Lord
himself, have "here no abiding city, but are seeking one to come."
Hence, when the King of Babylon came into the land where the Rechabites
had no fixed abode, they had no attachment to the place, and therefore
the more readily took their departure. Such, my soul, will be the case
with thee, in the land where thou art but a stranger, if, as a stranger
and a pilgrim, "thou abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the
soul; and set thine affections upon things above, and not on things of
the earth." Oh! how truly blessed to have no ties, no clogs, no
impediments, to fasten down the soul; but "when the Assyrian cometh up
into the land, this man, (this Glory-man, Christ Jesus,) is our peace,"
Micah v. 5. My soul, ponder well this sweet view of the house of the
Rechabites, and mark the Lord's observation concerning them: they obeyed
Jonadab their father, in all their abstinence and movements. The precept
for this obedience, it should seem, was but once given, and the motive
to it had no reward, either in dwelling-places here or hereafter. But
with thee, my soul, all that thy God and Father hath enjoined thee
concerning his dear Son, he hath again and again held forth; as he saith
himself, "rising early and speaking, he hath sent all his servants, the
prophets," as if entreating an attention to what must make for thy
present peace and everlasting happiness. Oh! how truly blessed, like the
house of the Rechabites, to sit loose and detached from earth and
earthly things, and to be tracing Jesus in all, and enjoying Jesus in
all. Go, my soul, go down frequently to the house of the Rechabites,
that there the Lord may cause thee to hear his word!</p>

9—Morning—John 17:10</h3>
<p>"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in
them."—John xvii. 10.</p>
<p>Precious testimony of a precious truth. See to it, my soul, that thou
suffer not these blessed words of Jesus to drop from thy remembrance;
but make them the everlasting meditation, not only of this morning, but
every morning, and every day, and all the day; and mark thine interest
in them. All Jesus's treasures in his people and his grace, are still
the Father's; for, as Jesus and the Father are one in essence and in
will, so also in property. And the Father's giving the church to Jesus,
with all blessings in him, doth not alienate the Father's right: so in
like manner, all that Jesus hath are the Father's, and Christ is
glorified in them. It is a blessed order in the work and purpose of
redemption, to trace the Father as the original Giver, Fountain, and
Source of all; and then to trace them as Jesus's by virtue of his being
the glorious Mediator. And hence the Holy Ghost is said to take them as
Jesus's and shew unto the people. The Holy Ghost doth not take them
immediately from the Father, but mediately from Christ; because, without
the person and work of Jesus, they never could have been communicated to
us. So that Christ is glorified by the Holy Spirit in the hearts of his
people, when that blessed Spirit takes them, and gives them, and skews
them, not immediately as the Father's, but as the fruit and consequence
of Christ's merits and death, and thus shewing the common interest both
of Father and Son, in all the blessed things of salvation. My soul, dost
thou understand these precious things? Oh then, live in the enjoyment of
them, and see that Jesus is glorified, and the Father glorified in his
dear and ever blessed Son.</p>

9—Evening—2 Thessalonians 2:13</h3>
<p>"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren,
beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the
truth."—2 Thess. ii. 13.</p>
<p>Some of the sweetest enjoyments in grace, are the freeness and
undeserved nature of that grace towards the happy objects of its
distinguishing favour: and as the first and ultimate design of all, for
which grace is given, is the glory of Jehovah; so the promotion of that
glory, in the redemption and sanctification of the church of Jesus, is
the means and end. Now, my soul, sit down, this evening, and mark well,
in the blessed effects wrought in thine own heart, what the apostle hath
here said, that if thou art chosen, it must have been from the beginning
thou art chosen to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and
belief of the truth. Pause, and ask thyself: art thou chosen? Hath this
sovereign act of grace passed upon thee? How shall I know? Look at the
effects. Art thou humbled to the very dust before God, under the
impression of the distinguishing nature of it? Dost thou know, dost thou
feel, dost thou stand as one most fully convinced, that the eternal
choice of thee was not for aught wherein thou differedst from others,
but wholly of the Lord's own free and sovereign grace? And in the
recollection that such love was shewn to thee, when meriting it no more
than others; yea, when meriting wrath, instead of receiving grace, as
much as others; dost thou lie yet lower in the dust on this account? And
in proportion to the astonishing goodness of the Lord, do thine own
conscious undeservings make thee continually yet more acquainted with
thine own vileness? And as the views of grace rise higher, does the
sense of sin make thee fall lower; that where "sin hath abounded, grace
should much more abound?" Look at the subject under another point of
view, but which leads to the same conclusion. As the consciousness of
being chosen, from the beginning, to salvation,. through the
sanctification of the Spirit, becomes the highest and strongest of all
possible motives to hide pride from the eyes, and to lay the soul down
in the deepest self-abasement before God; so in the same breast, and
from the same source, through the sanctification of the Spirit, there
will be a most ardent affection towards the gracious author of such
distinguishing mercy! Say then, my soul, should Jesus put the question
to thee, as he did to Peter, "Lovest thou me more than these?" couldest
thou appeal to him, who reads hearts, that he would find love in thine
heart, because he himself had put it there? Pause over this great volume
of inquiry, and follow up the question, in the numberless methods by
which it might be sought and discovered. And, to add no more, if to
those two great branches, under which God from the beginning makes
choice of all the beloved of the Lord, through sanctification of the
Spirit, thou canst add a satisfactory conclusion, in a third instance
also, of sovereign power; and discover that since God called thee by his
grace, and revealed his Son in thee, thou hast been conferring less and
less "with flesh and blood," and by the Spirit hast been "mortifying the
deeds of the body, and crucifying the flesh with its affections and
lusts: Oh! what cause wilt thou find also for holy joy in the
distinguishing grace of God, and to cry out with the apostle, "I am
crucified with Christ:" and, "I am bound to give thanks alway to God,
because from the beginning he hath chosen me to salvation, through the
sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth!"</p>

10—Morning—Exodus 11:7</h3>
<p>"That ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the
Egyptians and Israel."—Exod. xi. 7.</p>
<p>Who shall mark down all the properties of distinguishing grace? What
a vast difference doth grace make, in this life, between him that
serveth God, and him that serveth him not! And what an everlasting
difference will be made in the life which is to come. My soul, make this
thought the subject of thine unceasing meditation. Thou canst not walk
the street, nor go to public worship, nor watch the Lord's dealings in
all the vast and numberless dispensations going on in life, in the wide
world of providence and grace, but what every thing speaks, in the
language of the morning portion, of the difference there is still put
between the Egyptians and Israel. Every thing proclaims it, every event
confirms it. And do not overlook the great point of all-it is the Lord
that doth all this. "Who maketh thee to differ from another?" Oh for
grace to be always on the watch-tower to mark this, and for grace to
acknowledge it! Precious Jesus, thou art the Source, the Fountain, the
Author, the Finisher, of all. "Oh the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are thy judgments, and thy
ways past finding out."</p>

10—Evening—1 Peter 1:14</h3>
<p>"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the
former lusts, in your ignorance."—1 Pet. i. 14.</p>
<p>There is somewhat very striking in these words of the apostle; and
they certainly mean more than not being found in actual transgression.
The very fashion of a new-born child of God is supposed to distinguish
his obedience; and his whole appearance, as well as his whole conduct,
marks that the former lusts of his ignorant state, when unregenerated,
are done away. And though the believer is not called upon to a
singularity of dress or apparel, yet a singularity against customs
leading to the confines of sin; and unsuited to the manners of a soul
walking with Jesus, should certainly distinguish the Redeemer's people.
It was said, as one among the characters by which they should be known;
that "they should dwell alone, and should not be reckoned among the
nations," Numb. xxiii. 9. And surely a total diversity of character,
pursuit, and conduct, ought to distinguish them from the world. For,
even among men, different nations have their diversity of character and
occupation; and if there be a subject of contention between them, the
ports and garrisons of one kingdom are shut against the admission of the
people of another; there will be a total disconformity in this case, and
nothing of harmony between them. My soul, see to it, that thy path and
walk of life bear not the fashion of the world. Thou hast given thy name
unto Jesus: his thou art, and the subject of his kingdom; professing to
be guided by another Spirit, directed by another rule, walking by
another faith, and looking forward to another world. See then, that
every thing in and about thee mark this character of Jesus's pilgrim.
Let thy dress be the robe of Jesus's righteousness; thine armour, the
sword of the Spirit; thy conversation always "such as becometh the
gospel of Christ." And as the Redeemer, long before he came, by the
spirit of prophecy, pointed oat the singularity of himself and
followers, "as for signs and wonders in Israel," Isa. viii. 18. so let
the character be thine, as "Joshua and his fellows, men wondered at,"
Zech. iii. 8. Precious Jesus! keep me always near thyself, and let my
soul be always exercising a holy jealousy over all the parts of my
conduct. Lord, I would pray, that whereever I am, or however engaged,
all who behold me may know that "I have been with Jesus!"</p>

11—Morning—Isaiah 1:4</h3>
<p>"He wakeneth morning by morning: he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the
learned."—Isaiah 1:4.</p>
<p>Who is this but Jesus in his human nature, of whom the prophet
speaks? Eminently to him doth it refer, to whom was given the tongue of
the learned, that he might know how to speak a word to him that is
weary. Precious Lord, it is indeed thy province, and thine only, to
speak a word to weary souls, and to be the rest wherewith thou causeth
the weary to rest, and to be their refreshing. Not only to give them
rest, but thyself to be their rest. Not only to give them salvation, but
thyself to be their salvation.—But, blessed Lord! may not a poor soul
like myself say of thee also, that thou wakenest me morning by
morning?—for who is it but Jesus, that, by the sweet influences of the
Spirit, wakens his people morning by morning, and openeth the ear to
hear, and the eye to see, and the heart to. feel the blessed tokens of
his coming? Have I not found thee, Lord, wakening my soul sometimes
before the dawn of day, and calling my soul up in gracious meditation,
to attend to the soft whispers of thy love? Have I not heard thee
saying, as to tile church of old, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and
come away?" And hast thou not made my soul, or ever I was aware, like
the chariots of Aminadab? Do thou, Lord, waken me, I beseech thee,
morning by morning, and while thou art thus speaking to my soul, let
mine answer be, "My voice shalt thou hear betimes, Oh Lord, in the
morning; early will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. My
soul shall wait for thee, more than they that watch for the morning,
yea, I say, more than they that watch for the morning."</p>

<p>"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, what is thy
petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to
the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."—Esther v. 6.</p>
<p>My soul, thou hast lately been at the banquet of wine indeed, even of
the Redeemer's blood, which Jesus holds at his table; and didst thou not
behold the numberless petitioners who attended there with thyself?
Surely, if the Persian king made so generous an offer to Esther, to
perform her petition, be it what it might, to the half of his kingdom;
thy Jesus, thy heavenly King; with whom are all the treasures, and the
unsearchable riches of grace and glory, did not suffer a poor humble
petitioner to go empty away. Tell me, ye that attended there, did ye not
find the King most gracious? How went the matter with you? I pray you
tell me. Did the poor man find Jesus indeed rich; and did the trembling
sinner, under the apprehensions of wrath, find himself delivered by him
"from the wrath to come?" Surely, Jesus had a suited mercy for every
case. And, sure I am, that whatever heart was prompted by his grace to
look to him, the eye and heart of Jesus were looking with mercy upon
that poor sinner. Oh! what gifts, what graces, what pardons, doth every
renewed banquet of Jesus scatter among the people! At his table the
doors are thrown open, and nothing is needed to ensure welcome, but a
sense of need and an hungering to partake. How often, my soul, hast thou
seen the people made joyful in the Lord's house of prayer, and
returning, as they did after the feast of the dedication of Solomones
temple, to their tents, "joyful and glad in heart?" Yea, how often hast
thou returned thyself, and left all thy sorrows, sins, and wants behind
thee, when the King hath held forth his sceptre of grace, and given thee
faith to touch it! Come, ye polluted, poor, exercised, distressed souls;
ye wandering, weary, backsliding people; come to Jesus: he holds a
feast, and every case and every need, he can, and will supply. Let but a
sense of need be inwrought by the blessed Spirit in the heart, and the
language of our Jesus is to this amount: "What is thy petition, and what
is thy request? and it shall be granted thee."</p>

<p>What man is this but the Glory-man, the Mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus? And what peace, when all enemies oppose the soul,
but peace in the blood of his cross? Yes, my soul, Jesus is the
wonderful man, who alone could make thy peace. "For as it was by one
man's disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one
shall many be made righteous." And none but one in our own nature could
redeem that nature; for the right of redemption belonged only to him.
Levit. xxv. 25. And none but one in our nature could atone, could bleed,
could die, and rise again, that he might be the Judge, both of the dead
and living. Oh precious Jesus, how suited wert thou by the union of thy
two natures, as God and man, and God-man, both in one, to be our
glorious Mediator, and to be the Lord our Righteousness! Yes, precious
Lord, God hath said it, and my soul evermore rejoiceth in the blessed
truth: this man, Christ Jesus, shall be my peace, my glory, my
salvation, my refuge, when the Assyrian shall come into our land.</p>

12—Evening—2 Peter 1:19</h3>
<p>"The day-dawn, and the day-star."—2 Peter i. 19.</p>
<p>And what is "the day-dawn, and day-star," arising in the hearts of
God's people, but Jesus, "the dayspring from on high, visiting us?" Is
not Jesus "the bright and morning star, the light and the life of men?"
Yea, is he not "the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in his
wings?" And when he ariseth on our benighted minds, may he not be
called, "the day-dawn, and the day-star?" Pause, my soul, over the sweet
thought. It was all darkness in the creation of God, until Jesus arose.
And his coming was as the breaking forth of the morning, the sure
harbinger of day. Indeed, Jesus was "the day-dawn, and the day-star," in
the light of redemption, before the world was formed: for in the council
of peace, as man's light and salvation, he carne up, at the call of God,
from all eternity. And in time, during all his eventful ministry upon
earth, was not Jesus "a light to lighten the gentiles, and to be the
glory of his people Israel?" And what is Jesus now, but "the day-dawn,
and day-star" of all the promises? Until we see Christ in them, they are
nothing. It is he that makes them all "yea and amen;" and is "the
daydawn, and day-star" of all dispensations. His word, his providences,
his grace, his ordinances; all are dark, until Jesus ariseth, as "the
day-dawn, and day-star," to enlighten them. When he shines in upon them,
then are they blessed and clear. When he withdraws his light, not one of
them can be read. And what is "the day-dawn, and day-star," in the
hearts of his people, converting them from darkness to light, and from
the power of sin and Satan to the living God, but Jesus, shining by his
Holy Spirit within, and bringing them to the knowledge, love, and
enjoyment of himself? Say, my soul, what was the day, the ever blessed,
ever-to-be remembered day, when God, who commanded the light to shine
out of darkness, shined in upon thine heart; and Jesus, "the day-dawn,
and the day-star," arose, to give thee "the light of the knowledge of
the glory of the Lord, in the face of Jesus Christ?" Hail, thou glorious
light and life of my soul! Oh! continue thy sweet influences, morning by
morning, and in the daydawn, and evening-star of thy grace; until, after
many dark dispensations, and wintry days of my blindness, ignorance, and
senseless state, in which thou wilt renew me, in the precious
discoveries of thy love, I am carried through all the twilight of this
poor dying state of things below: for then shall I awake up to the full
enjoyment of thyself in glory, to see thee in one full open day, and to
be made like unto thee in thy kingdom of light, and life, and happiness,
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>"Jesus made a surety."—Heb. vii. 22.</p>
<p>My soul, look at Jesus as a Surety, and as "made the Surety" this
morning! Blessed view, if so be the Holy Ghost will enlighten thine eyes
to see him under all these characters. First; a Surety. "We are all
ruined by a debt incapable of ever being paid by any, or by all, the
fallen sons of Adam. Jesus steps in, becomes a Surety for our debt, and
pays the whole by his obedience and death. But we owe a duty also, as
well as a debt. Jesus becomes here again the Surety. He will put his
Spirit in us, and we shall live. He becomes also a Surety for promises,
that all God hath promised for his sake, shall be fulfilled in him, and
in us for him. But he is not only a Surety, but made a Surety; for the
Father's name, and the Father's authority, is in him. It is God the
Father which saith, I have given trim for a covenant. Precious thought
for faith to act upon! And, my soul, is not Jesus thy Surety? Yes, if
while the Father thus freely gives, thou as fully receivest, and art
looking to no other. Say then, my soul, is it not so with thee? Is not
Jesus thy all in all, thy Surety, thy Sponsor, thy Redeemer? And cost
thou not say, Thou shalt answer for me, Oh Lord my God! Oh comprehensive
word, Jesus made a Surety.</p>

<p>"I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down why should the
work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?"—Nehem. vi. 3.</p>
<p>My soul, a very blessed instruction is held forth to thee, in these
words. Nehemiah met with sad interruptions in his service, while
building the Lord's house. Various were the attempts made by the enemies
of God and his cause, to call him off from his labours. But this was his
answer to all. Now, my soul, thou hast many enemies also, both from
within and without; the world, and the powers of darkness, and thine own
corruptions, are all in league to interrupt thy pursuit of divine
things. When, therefore, the Sanballats and the Geshems of the day
invite thee to the villages, in the plain of Ono, here is thine answer:
"Why should the work of the Lord cease, when the King's business
requires dispatch?" Wherefore should the body, with all its corrupt
affections, drag down the soul? Is it reasonable, is it proper to be
concerned for the things of a day, while regardless of eternity? Wilt
thou for ever be as little children, amused with toys, and taken up with
playthings, when Jesus is calling thee, and proposing himself to thee,
for thy constant, unceasing, present, and everlasting delight? Oh! for
grace and strength from the Lord, to be able, like Abraham, to fray away
those fowls which come down upon the sacrifice! Oh! do thou, Lord, drive
both the buyers and the sellers from thy temple! Take my whole heart and
soul, and all my affections, and fix and centre them all on thyself!
Every vanity, every robber, like Barabbas of old, will be preferred to
thee, thou dear Emanuel, unless thy grace restrain and keep under, what
thy grace hath taught me to know and feel that I carry about with me, a
body of sin and death, which is forever calling me aside from thee. Oh!
let thy grace make its way through all the swarms of vain thoughts and
interruptions which surround me, and make my soul "as the chariots of
Aminadab!" Let no longer these "dead flies spoil the excellent
ointment," made fragrant by the rich spices of thy blessed Spirit; but
when saluted even by the most innocent call, like that made to Jesus
himself, of his mother and his brethren being without, desiring to speak
to him, Oh! for grace, that, like my Lord, even then, I may not suffer
the higher claims of my God and Saviour to pass by, nor the work of the
Lord and the concern of my soul to cease, whilst I come down to
them!</p>

<p>"Behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and
over all the power of the enemy."—Luke x. 19.</p>
<p>Astonishing the mercy, and wonderful the privilege manifested to the
followers of the Lamb! Poor, and weak, and helpless, as they are in
themselves, yet how strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus! My
soul, never lose sight of these blessed things. In Jesus thou art not
only a conqueror, but more than conqueror. As the armies in heaven
overcame by the blood of the Lamb, so here below, it is all in him, and
by him, the victory is obtained. God will bruise-Satan under our feet
shortly; but it is God that must bruise him, and it is he that must put
him under our feet. Oh for grace to see where our strength is, and as
cheerfully to ascribe all to him; that He, in whom we are made to tread
on serpents and scorpions, may have the glory due to his name, that He
who gives the strength may have the praise.</p>

14—Evening—Luke 12:29</h3>
<p>"Neither be ye of doubtful mind."—Luke xii. 29.</p>
<p>My soul, it is a blessed thing to arrive at a fixed point, on the
momentous concern of "the one thing needful." As long as there remains
any doubt or uncertainty whether Christ be the soul's portion or not,
there is always a proportioned degree of doubt and uncertainty in the
soul's comfort. What the dying patriarch said to his son, may with equal
truth be said of every one of this description: "Unstable as water, thou
shalt not excel," Gen. xlix. 4. For as long as the soul forms
conclusions of safety, not from what Jesus is, but from what the soul's
views of Jesus are there will be always an unstable, unsettled state.
And how many have I known, who are of doubtful. mind, whether they
really do believe to the salvation of the soul, and yet have no doubt
whether they be sinners, and both need and earnestly desire that
salvation. They will tell you that Jesus is more precious than the
golden wedge of Ophir; but they tell you at the same time, they dare not
say that they have an interest in his blood and righteousness. They see
a loveliness in his person, and a suitableness to their necessities, in
every point of view; but they cannot presume to hope that they are
welcome to enjoy either. They can and do cry out, under the thirst of
the soul for Jesus, as David did for the waters of Bethlehem; but still,
like David, they do not make use of the blessing, though it be procured
them. My soul, it is blessed to live above doubts and fears, by living
upon Jesus. The assurance of faith is founded in what Jesus is, and not
what his people feel; in what view God the Father beholds Christ as the
sinner's surety, and not what our apprehensions are concerning our
present feelings. Faith is most strong where sense is most weak; and the
glory given to Jesus is greater, when, like Abraham, "against hope, we
believe in hope." Blessed Lord Jesus! let the faith of my soul be the
one fixed unalterable faith, that admits of no doubt nor change. Let me,
with full purpose of heart, cleave unto the Lord. And while I can and do
behold, through thy Spirit's teaching me, the Father's appointment and
approbation, in all thy work and finished salvation; here let me fix,
and never be of doubtful mind, but live and die in the full assurance of
faith, well pleased with what my God and Father is well pleased with,
and always "rejoicing in hope of the glory of God!"</p>

15—Morning—Philippians 4:3</h3>
<p>"Whose names are in the book of life."—Phil. iv. 3.</p>
<p>How is this known? It must be a blessed privilege this, and highly
desirable to attain, if there be a truly scriptural testimony to it.
That there is a book of life, in which the record is made of the people
of the Lamb, is without all dispute, from many parts of scripture. The
church of the first-born are said to have their names written in heaven;
such as are chosen of God in Christ before the world began. But these
are secret things which belong to the Lord our God. Yet it is said, "the
secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his
covenant." Hence therefore, is not the bible a copy of this book of
life? Are there not scriptural marks and characters given, by which the
correspondence is proved? In both, they are distinguished by one and the
same name and character. They are called the people, the seed, the
offspring of Jesus. They are his, by gift, by purchase, by conquest, by
a voluntary surrender. They are known by the character as well as by
name. They seek salvation only in Jesus. God is their Father, Jesus
their Redeemer, the Holy Ghost their sanctifier. My soul, see thy name
in bible characters answering to this persuasion, and be assured that
the original writing of the book of life in heaven, and the book of God
for life upon earth, is his written word, is in exact correspondence.
Blessed Jesus! give me in this way to know whose I am and to whom I
belong, and then assured shall I be that my name is in the book of
life.</p>

15—Evening—Jeremiah 15:21</h3>
<p>"And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will
redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible."—Jer. xv. 21.</p>
<p>My soul, hash thou ever considered some of the many ways of softening
trouble? Sit down, and learn it from this sweet scripture. Here is a
general promise, which may be suited to particular circumstances, and
such as will hold good in all. But first remember, that he who promiseth
"to deliver from the sorrow, is the same that appointeth the sorrow:
Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it." The Lord's rod hath a voice
that speaks, as well as corrects; and it is a mark of wisdom to listen,
as well as feel. Hence, if we mark the hand that appoints, we shall
observe also all the other interesting particulars, both of the
instruments by which the Lord works, the time and place, the means and
end, and then discern love and grace, yea, Jesus himself, in all.
Suppose it be the world that crosses, or Satan that tempts, or false
friends that oppose, or our mother's children that be angry with us; yet
all are but the Lord's ministers; they are the sword, but the hand is
the Lord's; and though they mean ill; he will bring good; if they even
cast into prison, Jesus will be there. All things, and all means, and
all times, shall, at his command, minister to his own purpose. If there
be a storm without, Jesus hath chambers to take them into; if the
affliction be within, Jesus can help them out. Yea, the very "earth
shall help the woman," when the enemy casts forth a flood after her to
swallow her up. Be the storm what it may, Jesus is at the helm. Like
Joseph's afflictions, they shall minister to good, and the end bring the
proof, that the whole had the appointment in love. Hence, my soul,
though the direction is short, it is very sweet; never look at the
trial, without looking also at the Appointer; never allow thyself to
view the affliction, without looking through it to One that stands
behind, regulating and moving all. It matters not in this case, what the
storm threatens, but what the Lord Jesus means; not what the instrument
intends, but what Jesus hath appointed. And by thus looking to Christ,
the greatest troubles will give thee but little concern. He saith,
(blessed be his name) "I will deliver thee out of the hand of the
wicked; and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible." How it
is to be accomplished, is his concern, and not mine. All I have to do is
to rest in the certainty of the promise, by giving credit to the great
Promiser; and the end will chew, that with him it is to make "darkness
light, and crooked things straight."</p>

16—Morning—Song of Solomon 1:11</h3>
<p>"We will make thee borders of gold, with studs of silver."—Song i.
11.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder over these words. What borders of gold shall be made
for the believer, but the robe of Jesus's righteousness? And what
silver, but the garment of his salvation? If thou art clothed with this,
my soul, thou wilt shine indeed with more lustre than all the embroidery
of gold and precious stones, which perish with using. But mark, my soul,
who it is that makes them, and who puts them on thee—surely none but
God. And observe how all the persons of the Godhead are engaged in this
work. "We will make thee," is the language. Yes, Jehovah, Elohim, who
said, "Let us make man," at the original creation; the same now saith,
at the new creation, "We will make thee borders of gold, with studs of
silver." And is it not the hand of God the Father in this blessed,
gracious act, in the gift of his Son to the poor sinner? Is it not Jesus
who hath wrought out a robe of salvation for the poor sinner? And is it
not the Holy Ghost who puts on the blessed adorning upon the poor
sinner, in taking of the things of Jesus, and shewing unto him? Oh
precious testimony of a precious God in Christ! Be it unto me, Lord,
according to thy word. Let me be thus clothed and adorned, and I shall
be happy now, and happy to all eternity.</p>

16—Evening—Hebrews 13:12</h3>
<p>"Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own
blood."—Heb. xiii. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, I would have thee this evening, take a view of thy Jesus in
his own blood, under the special and particular act in which this
scripture holds him forth; sanctifying the people by the application of
it, as the great object and design for which he suffered. There is
somewhat uncommonly interesting in this view, though not so commonly
considered. That this is the only laver for sin, is unquestionable; and
that it is infinitely meritorious, and of eternal efficacy, is also
equally true. But when we consider farther, the infinite purity of it,
flowing, as it did, from an holy heart, in a nature that was altogether
holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens; there is somewhat which, though too deeply founded in
mystery to be perfectly apprehended by us, may yet serve to intimate the
immense preciousness of it, and its immense importance and value. But we
must not stop here. The union of the Godhead with the human nature,
giving both dignity and validity to the sacrifice which Jesus once
offered, that he might sanctify the people; here angels, as well as men,
find their faculties unable to ascertain the extent of the wonderful
subject; and, perhaps, through all eternity, none among the creation of
God, will fully be competent to explain it. But, my soul, though unable
to explain, or unable to conceive the infinitely precious nature of thy
Jesus's blood, yet do thou gather this sweet and soul-reviving thought
from the contemplation; it must be in itself so incalculable in value,
and so infinitely powerful in its pardoning and cleansing properties,
that no sin, no, not all the sin of finite creatures taken in the
aggregate, can stand before it. Oh precious, precious Jesus! precious,
precious blood of Jesus, which cleanseth from all sin! Oh, let me hear,
and feel, and know my personal interest in that sweet promise of my God
in Christ, and my happiness is made for ever; "I will sprinkle clean
water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all filthiness, and from all
your idols, will I cleanse you." Amen! Amen! So be it.</p>

17—Morning—Jeremiah 33:13</h3>
<p>"And in the cities of Judah shall the flocks pass again under the
hands of him that telleth them, saith the Lord."—Jer. xxxiii. 13.</p>
<p>See, my soul, what a blessed scripture is here. Meditate upon it,
this morning. Whose hands can these be but Jesus's? For whose are the
flocks but his? Is he not in all the scripture said to be a Shepherd,
and the good Shepherd that giveth his life for the sheep? And would he
give his life for sheep lie knew not? Surely that is impossible.
Moreover, did not the Father give them to him? Did he not receive them
from the Father? And did he not know them and count them over, when he
received them? "I know my sheep," saith Jesus, "and am known of mine."
And observe, the flocks are said to pass again under his hands. A plain
proof that they have all passed before. Nay, is it not said, that he
telleth them? Yes, "He calleth them all by name, and, leadeth them
forth, and goeth before them." And he saith himself, "Of all thou hast
given me, I have lost none." Precious scripture of a most precious
Saviour! How then can any be lost? If Jesus knew them when he received
them, counted them over, set his seal upon them, and they must all pass
again under his Almighty hand, how shall one, even one, be found
wanting, when he maketh up his jewels? Poor weather-beaten shorn lamb of
Jesus's fold, whosoever thou art, think of these things, when wandering,
or cold, or in darkness, or on the mountains. Jesus will seek thee out
in the dark and cloudy day. He will bring thee home, and thou shalt lie
in his bosom, and by and by dwell with him for ever; for he is, he must,
he will still be, Jesus.</p>

17—Evening—Jeremiah 13:11</h3>
<p>"As the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to
cleave unto me the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Judah,
with the Lord; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name,
and for a praise, and for a glory."—Jer. xiii. 11.</p>
<p>See, my soul, the blessedness of witnessing to God, and witnessing
for God. His people, the Lord saith, are called, and are, in the midst
of a crooked and perverse generation, as lights in the world. Both
Israel and Judah are included in what is here said; and by the figure of
a girdle cleaving to the loins of a man, so close, so strongly bound,
and extending all around, is shewn the nearness, and firmness, and the
security in every way, and by every direction, in which the Lord's
people are brought into relation with him. Such, then, were the Lord's
people of old, a people near to himself; and as they were the Lord's own
choice, so were they dear to the Lord; and as he had made the whole Of
the nation a kingdom of priests to the Lord, so were they wholly
designed for the divine glory: "This people have I formed for myself;
they shall shew forth my praise." Now pause, my soul, over this blessed
scripture, and contemplate with what holy rapture and delight a child of
God, under the new testament dispensation, may look up and behold his
nearness and dearness to God in Christ, by virtue of his union with
Jesus. Here the figure, beautiful as it is, of a girdle encircling the
loins, doth not come up to the full idea of that oneness and union which
the believer stands in with Jesus. For the soul not only is made by the
Lord himself to cleave unto Christ, as the ivy clings to the oak; but
being part of Christ's mystical body, is, like the branch in the vine,
one with Christ, and Christ with him. The believer in Jesus is
interested in all that is in Jesus; and not only cleaves to him, but is
part of himself, and is blessed in his blessedness, and beheld and
accepted, and loved by God the Father, as the Father loveth Jesus. And
think; my soul, what unspeakable felicity ariseth out of this one
consideration, that, amidst all thy coldness, and wanderings, and
departures, still the Lord causeth his Judah and Israel to cleave to
him. However the poor senseless child in arms lets go his holdfast, when
hanging round the neck of its nurse and protector, yet the little
creature falls not, because he is upheld by his support from her. So the
one only cause that thou art supported and preserved from falling is,
because "the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
everlasting arms." It is the Lord that saith, "I have caused to cleave
unto me the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Judah." And
Oh! what a name, and a praise, and a glory, will be the whole redeemed
church of God in Christ, when Jesus brings them all home, and presents
them to himself and Father, as "a glorious church, not having spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without
blemish before him in love!"</p>

<p>This is a precious scripture. My soul, put a note upon it. No sigh,
no groan, no tear of God's people can pass unobserved. He putteth the
tears of his people in his bottle. Surely then he can never overlook
what gives vent to those tears, the sorrows of the soul. Our spiritual
afflictions Jesus knows, and numbers all. How sweet the thought! the
Spirit maketh intercession for the saints with the groanings which they
cannot utter. And do, my soul, observe the cause of deliverance. Not our
sighs, nor our groanings, nor our brokenness of heart; not these, for
what benefit can these render to an holy God? But God hath respect in
all to his own everlasting covenant. Yes, Jesus is the all in all of the
covenant. God the Father hath respect to him. For his sake, for his
righteousness, for his atoning blood, the groanings of his people find
audience at the mercy-seat and redress. And God hath respect to his own
word, his oath, his promises to his dear Son. Oh blessed assurance—Oh
precious security! How shall any poor groaning child of God go unheard,
unpardoned, unrelieved, who hath double security in the glory of God the
Father's sovereign grace, and covenant word and oath to depend upon; and
the everlasting covenant righteousness, and atoning blood of God the
Son, to he found in? Here, my soul, rest, for ever rest, thy sure claim
to grace and glory.</p>

<p>"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour, whom resist
stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."—l Pet. v. 8,
9.</p>
<p>My soul, thou knowest, and hast long known, from the many wounds
given thee by Satan, what a cruel, insidious, and powerful enemy thou
hast to contend with; and thou too truly knowest, also, how sadly
unequal thou art in thyself to resist his wiles. He is a prince of the
power of the air: he is by nature, a spirit, and therefore invisible;
thou seest not his approaches; he is a tremendous foe, full of envy,
malignity, subtilty, craft, and design: and what renders him yet more
formidable is, that in the corruptions and unbelief' of thy fallen
nature, he hath but too many confederates in thine own heart, to aid him
in his diabolical designs. Where then is thy strength to resist him? It
cannot be in thyself, nor in thy best exertions. The devil would laugh
at these, and all would be but as feathers to the breath of his
temptations. Hear what the apostle saith: "Whom resist stedfast in the
faith." See here, where thy strength is. Faith in Jesus is the only, and
it is an infallible defence against all the fiery darts of the wicked.
There is nothing that Satan dreads, but the blood of the cross. There is
nothing that conquers him, but faith in Jesus's blood. Tell him of the
blood which cleanseth from all sin, and he will flee from thee. This was
the sole power by which the holy armies in heaven cast down the accuser
which accused them before our God, day and night: "they overcame by the
blood of the Lamb," Rev. xii. 9-11. and the same will give thee the
victory now. Faith in the blood of the cross, is the grace by which we
have access to God. It is by faith the soul looks to Jesus; by faith the
soul is kept stedfastly resting on Jesus; by faith the devil is
stedfastly resisted, in taking confidence in the full and complete
redemption that Jesus accomplished on the cross. Look then, my soul, for
ever to the cross, and while thy faith honours Jesus, Jesus will honour
thee; and this will be the standard which the Spirit of Jehovah will
lift up, when at any time the enemy cometh in like a flood; Isa. lix.
19. Oh! the triumphs of the cross! "They overcame by the blood of the
Lamb."</p>

<p>My soul, contemplate this morning the auspicious and blessed effects
brought into the circumstances of mankind by the gospel. Not only shall
there be new heavens, and a new earth, but new hearts, new minds, new
dispositions to enjoy them. "If any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature. Old things are passed away, and all things are become new."
And among the many blessed changes that shall take place in consequence
of Jesus's salvation, all untimely deaths are done away. Indeed, there
can be no such thing as an untimely death to those who are in Christ:
for a voice from heaven pronounces all blessed that die in the Lord. A
child new born, if born also in Christ, an 'infant. of a day, if a
gracious day, is as ripe for glory as if an hundred years had passed
over him. Indeed, he is an hundred years old in Jesus. Sweet thought!
what a blessedness, dearest Jesus, hath thy great salvation introduced
into the circumstances of thy people. But what an awful thought—the life
of an unawakened, unregenerated sinner, though protracted to an hundred
years, is lengthened only to misery. As he came into the world, so he
goes through it, and so he goes out of it—an unrenewed sinner. Oh

little word Selah not been placed at the end, by way of marking the
emphasis of the Holy Ghost? Who couldest thou have considered suitable
to have chosen the inheritance of his people, but he who is the Lord of
his people, and himself their inheritance and their portion for ever? It
was God thy Father that chose him to be the excellency of Jacob, when he
gave him for a covenant to the people; and when to the infinite mind of
Jehovah, this One glorious Person, in the holiness and purity of his
nature, came up before him here, on him the Lord placed his choice. And
had all his people been present; had it been possible for the whole of
the chosen of Zion to have been consulted in the choice, would not every
soul have fixed its longing eyes upon him, and from the millions of
tongues resounding his blessed and blissful name from every heart, the
universal voice would have been heard in the delightful words of this
scripture: "He shall choose our inheritance for us; the excellency of
Jacob, whom he loved!" Hail! thou dear and blessed Lord! thou art indeed
our inheritance, and our portion for ever! And hail, thou glorious,

<p>"His glory is great in thy salvation; honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him; for thou hast made him most blessed for ever."—Ps. xxi.
5, 6.</p>
<p>My soul, it is the most delightful of all thoughts, when at any time
thou art solacing thyself in the glories of thy Redeemer, to call to
mind that God the Father is glorified, while thou art made happy in the
salvation thy Jesus hath accomplished by his blood and righteousness. It
is indeed God the Father which called Jesus to the office and character
of the Redeemer, and furnished him with all suitable requisites for the
vast work he called him to do. But the glory and honour of Jehovah were
the first and great object of the Redeemer's work; and hence Jesus, in
the days of his flesh, never speaks of his own glory, but as in
connection with, and leading to the glory of Jehovah. "Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him! Father! glorify thy Son,
that thy Son also may glorify thee." Hence, therefore, when Jehovah laid
honour and majesty upon the blessed Jesus, and made him most blessed for
ever; all these things were to the Father's honour and glory: and never
was God the Father's glory more great than in and by the salvation of
his dear Son Christ Jesus. See, my soul! I charge it upon thee, that
thou never lose sight of this precious view of God thy Father's glory,
in thy redemption by thy adorable Redeemer. Say continually, and dwell
with rapture on the blessed subject: 'My God, my Father in Christ Jesus,
is glorified, yea, greatly glorified in his dear Son, in that he hath
wrought out such a salvation as brings more glory to God the Father than
all the works of his creation; and it is to the honour and glory of
Jehovah, that poor sinners should be saved in this blessed way of his
own appointing. And shall I not then come to him in and through Jesus?
Shall I not delight to tell my God and Father how great his glory is in
the salvation by Jesus? Shall I not bless and glorify my God and Father
in being the Author and Giver of such great salvation? Yea, most blessed
God and Father! I do bless thee, I do praise thee, I desire to love
thee, in and through Jesus. And while my whole soul is going out in
enjoyments on the person, and work, and offices, and relations of Jesus;
always would I keep in view, and connect with it, in the enjoyment, that
it is thou, most gracious and almighty Father, that hast made him most
blessed for ever. Surely then, thy glory is great in his salvation! And
the glory of the Son of God is great in thy salvation!</p>

my soul, on what it is suspended—"If ye are Christ's." And whose art
thou, my soul, but his? Hath not the Father given thee to him? And hath
not the Son of God bought thee with a price? Hast thou not made a
voluntary surrender of thyself to Jesus, and given thyself to him in an
everlasting covenant which cannot be broken? Oh yes, yes, all this is
certain. Lord, grant me grace and faith in lively exercise, that I may
now take to myself all the blessedness of it by anticipation; until I
come to realize the whole in absolute enjoyment in glory. Christ is
mine, and with him, heaven is mine. God the Father is mine, the Holy
Ghost is mine, all covenant blessings are mine; ordinances, means of
grace, the holy book of God, all are mine here, and will be my portion
for evermore. Hallelujah.</p>

21—Evening—Song of Solomon 4:13, 14</h3>
<p>"Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits,
camphor with spikenard, spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
with all trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, with all the chief
spices."—Song iv. 13, 14.</p>
<p>Hear, my soul, what Christ, thy Husband and thy Saviour, saith to the
church! and as thou art a part of it in him, take it to thyself. Surely
the church of Jesus is his garden, and every plant in it, which the
heavenly Father hath planted, must flourish, with all the increase of
God, as trees of the Lord's right-hand planting. Even the tenderest
plants, the youngest of his people, form a part in this orchard of
pomegranates; for every one hath been taken out of nature's wild
wilderness, and brought, by sovereign and distinguishing grace, into the
Lord's garden, his church; and, like pomegranates, a large and
full-bearing fruit, sweet and delicious, they are in Jesus's eye most
pleasant, from the beauty and comeliness he hath put upon them. And do
observe how very gracious thy Lord is, in enumerating not only "the
pleasant fruits," but "the chief spices;" meaning, no doubt, that as in
him they partake of all that is his, and derive beauty, and fragrancy,
and fruitfulness, from their Lord, as the branch from the vine; so do
the various graces of his blessed Spirit appear in them, as the sweet
fruits under his creating and ripening influence. See to it, my soul,
that these things do appear in thee; and that faith, and love, and hope,
and joy, and peace in believing, abound in thee, through the Holy Ghost.
Oh! the blessedness of knowing these things, and enjoying them. And Oh!
the blessedness of being thus distinguished, as the rare spices of the
east, with such love-tokens of Jesus. Thou knowest that if thou art as
an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits, thou art wholly so from
Jesus. Nature never produceth them, neither can bring them forth, or
cause them to flourish. Oh! then, thou dear Lord! if I am by sovereign
grace, precious and pleasant in thy view, be thou eternally praised, and
eternally glorified for the distinguishing mercy: for of thee, and from
thee, and by thee, I am what I am; and Oh! let thy grace live in me, to
thy praise, and to the glory of his grace, "who hath made me accepted in
the Beloved!"</p>

<p>"The Lord will command his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in
the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
life."—Psalm xlii. 8.</p>
<p>Both night and day open sources of comfort, when Jesus is present,
and when Jesus sanctifies. How, indeed, my soul, canst thou be otherwise
than comfortable, while Jesus is with thee, and manifesting himself unto
thee? And do observe, my soul, the sweet expression in this verse. Thy
Lord, thy Jesus, will both create blessings and command them. His
loving-kindness, which is better than life itself will make daylight in
the soul, when otherwise it is night. And his love will shine, as the
stars in the darkest night sparkle with more lustre, with increasing
brightness, when dark providences are around. Nay, Jesus will give songs
in the night, when all things else are out of tune. Do thou, Lord, do
thou, my Lord, command then thy loving-kindness both by day and night,
and my prayer and praise shall both go forth to thee, the God of my
life; and "It shall put more gladness in my heart, than when corn, and
wine, and oil increase."</p>

22—Evening—Acts 4:30</h3>
<p>"Thy holy child Jesus."—Acts iv. 30.</p>
<p>There is somewhat so very sweet and precious in this expression,
that, my soul, I would have thee to meditate upon it. Surely the
apostles had a special meaning in calling the Lord Jesus, "the holy
child Jesus:" and no doubt the Holy Ghost did not cause his servants
thus to express themselves for nought. It will be thy wisdom, therefore,
to inquire. I do not find a similar phrase in all the word of God. The
Redeemer is spoken of, in the days of his infancy, as "the child Jesus;"
and when twelve years of age, he is still called "the child;" see Luke
ii. 27, 34, 43; but no where, that I recollect, does he receive the
blessed appellation that he is here distinguished by, of "the holy child
Jesus." It would be presumption in thee, to determine the cause of this
distinction; but it can be none to inquire. Sit down then, this evening,
favourable as it is to solemn meditation, and ponder well the subject.
Child and servant, in scripture language, we are told, have the same
meaning: hence the apostle observes, in his epistle to the church of the
Galatians, that "the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing
from a servant, though he be Lord of all," Gal. iv. 1. The phrase,
therefore, may be accepted under this view, and it will be agreeable to
the w hole tenor of the bible. See Isaiah xlii. 1. compared with Matt.
xii. 18. Nevertheless, I am inclined to think, that somewhat more is
intended by it, in this place of the apostles' prayer, when they called
Christ "the holy child Jesus." Perhaps in allusion to his holy nature,
contrasted to the unholy hands by whom he was crucified and slain; and
in this view the subject is truly lovely and interesting. Christ was to
be crucified by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God; but
none but unholy hands were to be embrued in the blood of God's "holy
child Jesus." And doth not the expression, "holy child Jesus," serve, in
a very striking manner, and with peculiar emphasis, to bring home to thy
thoughts the holiness of that nature, which, in the childhood of Jesus,
and from the womb, was altogether "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
from sinners, and made higher than the heavens?" Hence, before his
incarnation, the angel called him by a peculiar name, "that holy thing;"
not that holy man, but that "holy thing;" Luke i. 85. And doth not the
expression bring home, in a yet more endearing manner, if possible, the
blessedness of all this in the cause. For "the holy child Jesus," that
"holy thing," became the one holy representative of all his church and
people; he was, and is, and ever will be, "the head of his body, the
church;" and hence, in the sight of Jehovah, Christ and his members are
one. Now, my soul, considering the phrase in this point of view, what a
fulness of light, and life, and glory, and joy, doth it hold forth, and
pour in, upon the believer's mind! Lamb of God! I would say, "holy child
Jesus!" in thy holiness, cause me to behold myself always appearing
before God, and my Father; for, sure I am, if the Lord Jehovah made thee
to be sin for thy people, when thou knewest no sin, it was with the
express design, in his holy purpose, counsel, and will, that "they
should be made the righteousness of God in thee."</p>

<p>"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
thou shalt say."—Exod. iv. 12.</p>
<p>My soul, pause over this sweet promise which the Lord gave to Moses;
for surely the same is in effect said to every minister, every child of
God, and every believer. He that made man's mouth, will give every thing
suitable to the mouth, and proportion every thing to the necessity of
his people. And do, my soul, remark the comprehensiveness of the
promise. Will not He who undertakes to be with the mouth, be also with
all the renewed faculties of the soul? Jesus gives the tongue of the
learned. Jesus gives grace to the lips, understanding to the heart, eyes
to the blind, feet to the lame: the bread shall be given, and the water
shall be sure, and the defence shall be the mountains of rocks. Go then,
my soul, go wheresoever the Lord leads: for he saith, "Be not afraid, I
am with thee, I am thy. God." Learn, my soul; then to eye Jesus in all,
and depend upon it, Jesus will bless thee in the use of all. Make his
glory thy aim, and thy happiness will be his glory.</p>

23—Evening—Hosea 3:5</h3>
<p>"Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord
their God, and David their king."—Hosea iii. 5.</p>
<p>What a sweet scripture is this, and what abundant gospel contained in
the bosom of it? "Afterward shall the children of Israel return." After
having been long scattered on every high mountain, wandering over the
face of the whole earth, the Lord will bring them back; "he that hath
scattered Israel will gather him." There shall be abounding grace, for
abounding transgression; and what sin hath ruined, grace shall restore.
But to whom shall they return? To seek the Lord their God! Yes! this may
be done, and this will be done, if the Lord incline their hearts; the
same that gives the grace to seek, will give the mercy to find. "He hath
never said to the praying seed of Jacob, seek ye my face in vain!" But
it is said also, that they shall return to "David their king." Alas!
David king of Israel, bad been dead many a year, when this promise was
made, and his sepulchre, as Peter afterwards remarked, was with the
people unto this day; how then could they return to David their king?
Oh! the blessedness to see David's Lord thus preached in days before the
gospel. Though David king of Israel be dead; Christ, the seed of David
after the flesh, ever liveth, and to him shall Israel seek; after all
their rebellion, and after all the pursuit of their idols. Oh! precious
Lord Jesus! be it my portion also to seek unto thee in all thy covenant
relations and characters; "for where should a people seek, but unto
their God?" Let my soul feel the same longings as David himself felt,
when he cried out, "O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee; my
soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in this dry and
thirsty land where no water is!"</p>

<p>"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a
dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
man, nor waiteth for the sons of men."—Micah v. 7.</p>
<p>Observe, my soul, the character given of Jacob's seed, and bless the
Lord for being included in the number.—For so saith the apostle, "If ye
be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise." Mark then their characters. They are a remnant. But they are
God's remnant, being in covenant with God in Christ, and as such,
distinguished and separated from the world. "They are a people that
dwell alone, and not reckoned among the nations." They are in the midst
of many people, but belong to none of them. For though living in the
world, they are not of the world, but chosen out of the world. They are,
moreover, as a dew from the Lord. Beautiful resemblance! For as the dew
is from heaven, so believers in Christ are born from above: not of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Moreover, they
are as showers upon the grass; meaning, that as Jesus is promised to
come down as showers upon the mown grass to refresh his people, so his
people live in a constant dependence upon Jesus, and receive out of his
fulness, while all the earth is dry as stubble around them. Moreover, as
the rain waiteth: not for man, but wholly falls from God's appointment,
so grace is not dispensed for man's desert, but the Lord's free bounty.
Oh precious promise, or rather precious cluster of promises, and all in
Jesus.</p>

24—Evening—1 Samuel 1:15</h3>
<p>"I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit."—1 Sam. i. 15.</p>
<p>My soul, look at Hannah at the mercy-seat, and mark the sorrowful
spirit with which she there appeared. Blushing and sorrow, at the feet
of Jesus, are among the highest tokens of real heartfelt communion.
Perhaps there never was a moment in the life of Hannah, in which faith
was in more lively exercise, than in that memorable season. And,
perhaps, never did she speed with more success than then; for it is
said, that when she arose from before the throne, "she went her way, and
her countenance was no more. sad." Now, my soul, take a precious
instruction from her example. Do thou go to the throne, and present
thyself at the feet of thy Jesus. Let grace have a full and lively
exercise in thine heart. See that thy prayers be really and truly heart
prayers, and not lip-service. Tell thy Lord how greatly thou needest his
grace and mercy; and tell him, also, how much thy Lord Jesus will get
glory in being gracious: Let him see that thou art indeed in earnest.
And let the offering of a broken and contrite heart decidedly shew that
thou art also of a sorrowful spirit. And when thou hast done this, do as
Hannah did; leave thy sorrow with Jesus. She went her way and was no
more sad. To be sure not; for if she really left her concerns with
Jesus, she could not take them home to her own heart again. Here, my
soul, is thy mistake; thou dost as Hannah did only in part; a throne of
grace can witness for thee, that thou hast, times without number,
brought thy burdens, both of sin and sorrow, and laid them down at the
feet of thy Lord; but, alas! the same throne can witness against thee,
that, shortly after, through distrust, and fear, and unbelief, thou hast
fetched them away again, and taken the whole upon thyself. Dearest
Jesus, undertake for me. Oh, for grace, not only to bring all my burdens
to thee, but to leave them all with thee: for this is the only way to
make a sorrowful spirit glad, when I make thee as God the Father hath
made thee, the Almighty Burden bearer of all the sins and sorrows of thy
people!</p>

<p>"My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of
Engedi."—Song i. 14.</p>
<p>How full, indeed how infinitely full, abundant, and soul-satisfying
is Jesus, in all that concerns life, light, grace, glory! A cluster of
all is Christ; whether the copher of medicine to heal, or of sweetness
to satisfy, or of riches to enlarge, or salvation to impart. Every way,
and in every thing that is lovely or desirable, Jesus is a cluster
indeed to his people. And whether we meet him in the valley or in the
mount, in the plains of Jericho, or in the vineyards of Engedi, neither
place nor situation, neither state nor circumstances, make any
alteration in our Beloved; he is, he must be, Jesus, and that is always
lovely.</p>

<p>"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, in my name,
because ye belong to Christ, verily, I say unto you, he shall not lose
his reward."—Mark ix. 41.</p>
<p>How little is this attended to in the charities of life! I fear, that
even the soul which loveth Jesus most, doth not regulate his alms,
whether of this world's goods, or of prayer, or of good wishes, when he
giveth them, by this blessed standard. Dost thou not, my soul, plead
guilty to this charge? Heavenly Lord! enlighten mine eyes to see thee in
all thy representatives. And when I have only the cup of cold water to
bestow upon any poor needy creature, yet let me give that in thy name!
'Do you belong to Christ?' should be the only question. This is a claim
which carries every thing before it. Is it Jesus, who, in the person of
his poor members, asketh the alms? Doth the Lord of life and glory
condescend to be beholden to the poor creatures of his bounty; and of
his own absolutely receives as a loan or debt? Surely the most selfish
heart might here covet to be liberal. But, alas! love to Jesus is at too
low an ebb to swell the tides for pouring into the parched ground of our
neighbour's vineyard, from such principles. My soul, let this charming
scripture be henceforth much upon thy mind. Take it about thee
whithersoever thou guest. Look out for the Lord's poor, and so far read
their characters, as to see that they belong to Christ. And if thy Lord
hath made thee his almoner, if it be no farther than to minister the cup
of cold water; yet let that cup be given in his name, and because they
belong to Christ. Methinks, had it pleased my heavenly Father, to have
entrusted me with ample circumstances, I should rejoice to follow the
plan of his bounties, "who maketh his sun to rise upon the evil and upon
the good; and sendeth the blessings of his rain both upon the just and
the unjust." But even then, amidst the indiscriminate scattering of
temporal blessings all around, the given cup of cold water to one of
thine, thou blessed Jesus, because he belonged to thee, would be a
cordial to my own heart, that needed no higher joy than the
inexpressible felicity of testifying that myself as well as the receiver
were both the Lord's poor, and the Lord's property.</p>

wilt thou not cry out with David, in the contemplation of the
overwhelming mercy: "And is this the manner of man, Oh Lord God!" 2 Sam.
vii. 19. Think, Oh my soul, how it was with thee, when in the days of
thy unregeneracy thou wentest on frowardly in the way of thy perverse
heart. Who could have stopped thee, had not sovereign grace? And how
justly might the Lord have said, I have seen thy ways, and will punish
thee; I will give thee over to a reprobate mind, and forsake thee for
ever!—Oh the riches of grace, when, from my very unworthiness, the Lord
took occasion to magnify his love and mercy. Oh Lord Jesus, do thou
incline the heart that thou hast healed to live to thy praise, and let
the life thou hast saved from destruction, be spent in thy service.</p>

<p>"And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which

<p>My soul, pause over this blessed promise. To whom could it refer, but
to Jesus? "That day," through all the old testament dispensation, meant
the gospel church of the new testament dispensation. And when the Son of
God came, the day was come also. And did not Jesus stand often, during
this day of his grace, in his own ministry, teaching the people on the
mount of Olives? Yea, was it not the very last sacred spot on which his
holy feet stood, when from thence he ascended to heaven, having finished
redemption-work upon earth? My soul, do thou often, by faith, visit the
hallowed ground, and from thence let thy meditation take wing, after
thine ascended and exalted Saviour. And while, like the wondering
disciples, looking after Jesus as he went up, thou art contemplating the
glory of thy Lord, who is now above, carrying on all the blessed designs
of his love, for which he came below; recollect the assurance, that the
angels, who attended their Lord to grace his triumph, gave of his
return: His feet shall again stand at the last day upon the earth. "He
shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them
that believe." Oh! for grace to be always on the look out for my Lord's
return! Give me, blessed Jesus, to know thee as my Kinsman-Redeemer; to
know thee as the Lord my righteousness; to be living upon thee now by
faith, that then I may enjoy thee by living upon thy fulness, as in
grace here, so in glory to all eternity. Amen.</p>

<p>Is this thy portion, my soul? Hath the Lord thy God indeed chosen
thee? Hath he manifested his love to thee in so distinguishing a way?
Take comfort, then, in all thine exercises, when seasons of darkness
.and discouragement are around; think of God's choice, and venture on
God's love. Art thou distressed, exercised, afflicted? Dost thou call on
God, and find no answer? Doth the enemy tempt thee to doubt? Doth thine
own unbelieving heart misgive thee? Still recollect, Jesus knows all. He
chose thee—and he that chose thee knows all thine exercises; nay, he
himself hath appointed them. And remember, thou wast not forced upon
him. It was his own free choice first made thee his; and his own love
will be the security of thy present dependence. Jesus resteth in his
love; he hateth putting away. Cast down as thou art, thou art not cast
off. Though fallen, he can raise. Though dejected, he can and will
comfort. Sweet thought! He will turn. again; he will have compassion
upon us, and he will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.</p>

27—Evening—Acts 4:31</h3>
<p>"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
assembled."—Acts iv. 31.</p>
<p>Think, my soul, what a blessed testimony this must have been, in
confirmation to the disciples, that their God was a prayer-hearing, and
a prayer-answering God! And what a full reply to all they had been
praying for!' The enemies of God, and of his Christ, had threatened the
poor disciples what they would do to them, if they persisted in
preaching Jesus to the people. The purport, therefore, of the apostles
prayer was, not that the Lord would stop their malice, and silence all
their opposition: this they sought not to avoid. But the single prayer
was, that their souls might be animated to go on, let the malice of
their foes manifest itself as it might. In answer, "the place is
shaken." As if the Lord had said, "He that shakes the place, can make
your enemies hearts tremble." And so it proved. Now, my soul, take thine
improvement from it. Jesus sees all, knows all, hears all, as well of
thine exercises, as of thine enemies attempts upon thee. Carry all
complaints therefore to him. Depend upon it, that it is blessed to be
exercised; blessed for thee, that the enemies of God; and of his Christ,
threaten thee; blessed to be opposed, that thou mayest not recline upon
thine arms, or, like stagnant waters, become corrupt for want of
running. The hatred of the foes of Jesus affords occasion yet more for
Jesus to manifest his love; and though the place be not shaken whence
thy cries go up, the word of his grace gives the same sure answer. Jesus
looks on, Jesus upholds, Jesus supports. Do thou call every Bethel place
as Abraham's handmaid did: "Thou, Lord, seest me." No weapon formed
against God's people can prosper; and every tongue that riseth against
them in judgment, the Lord will condemn. "This is the heritage of the
servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the
Lord."</p>

thou bearest all our sins, so thou carriest all our sorrows. And dost
thou not bear all the persons of thy redeemed? Dost thou not bear all
our troubles, all our exercises, all our temptations, trials,
difficulties? The government is upon thy shoulder; the care of the
churches is all with thee. And shall I not cast all my care upon thee?
Shall I be careful for many things, while Jesus saith, "Cast thy burden

all things, and to leave all things with thee. Lord, do thou bear me up

shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that
turneth aside to tarry for a night?"—Jer. xiv. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, follow up these holy pleadings with thy Lord. Jesus loves
boldness, and not bondage frames. Remember, when thou goest to him, thou
goest to a tried friend, a long-proved, a faithful friend, and one that
loveth at all times; and he that was and is the hope of Israel, hath
ever been, and will be thy hope, thy Saviour, the Rock of Ages; yea,
"Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever." Is then thy
Jesus as a stranger to thee? Are his visits short, and but as the
wayfaring man that is hastening on his journey, who, though he stops at
the inn for the night, stops only to refresh himself, and takes no
account of what passeth in the house? Pause, my soul, it is time to
enquire. I hope no shyness has crept in between thy Lord and thee! When
did he last visit thee? When did he last manifest himself unto thee,
otherwise than he doth to the world? What precious Bethel visits bast
thou lately had? When did he shew thee all his secrets, and thou didst
tell him all that was in thine heart? When was his well-known voice last
heard by thee, saying, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me
from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and
Hermon, from the lions' den, from the mountains of the leopards?" And
when didst thou answer the gracious invitation, crying out, with joy
unspeakable, "It is the voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh leaping
upon the mountains, and skipping upon the hills!" Oh, my soul, my soul!
I charge it upon thee, to be very chary of the Lord's visits! See to it,
that thou art always upon the alert, waiting for them, and going forth
in holy longings and vehement desires after them. Depend upon it, Jesus
is no stranger in his visits, but it is thou who art a stranger to the
consciousness of his coming. Never is thy Lord as a wayfaring man, that
tarrieth but for a night with his people; but it is through thy sleepy,
slothful, forgetful frame, that, while Jesus is standing and knocking at
the door, saying, "Open to me," thou art regardless of his coming, and
having put off thy coat, feelest not inclined to put it on. Jesus,
Master, suffer not a coldness to arise, no, not for a moment, in my poor
heart, towards thee. Oh! give me a holy jealousy to be always on the
look-out for thy sweet visits. Do thou, my beloved, put in thy hand by
the hole of the door of my heart, that my bowels may be moved in earnest
desires for thy coming. For then, thou sweet Lord, thou that art the
hope of Israel and the Saviour thereof, then when thou comest, and I
shall find thee without, I will lead thee, and bring thee into my
mother's house, who would instruct me; and I would cause thee to drink
of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate; yea, I would constrain
thee, and hold thee fast, that thou shouldest not be as a wayfaring man
of the night, but I would keep thee until the break of day, and thou
shouldest make thyself known to me in breaking of bread and in
prayer!</p>

who is it that gives validity and efficacy to salvation? Jehovah.
"Beware of him," saith the Lord, "my name is in him." And how then can
my soul fail, or any promise in Christ pass unfulfilled, when Jehovah
sends and Christ completes the work the Father gave him to do? Blessed
Jesus! may I always look to thee under this precious character; and may
I hear thee speaking under that solemn, but blessed title, "I am the
Lord that healeth thee"</p>

29—Evening—Job 17:14</h3>
<p>"I have said to corruption, thou art my father; to the worm, thou art
my mother, and my sister."—Job xvii. 14.</p>
<p>My soul, take a turn now and then to the grave. It will be profitable
to look at the bed where thou art shortly to take up thy residence,
before thou art sent there to remain. Nothing so profitable to allay all
that heat and folly which keep men in a continual ferment, as a solemn
view of "the house appointed for all living." To be sure, nothing can be
more humbling than what Job here speaks of his relations: great men and
nobles will not be very fond of the alliance; but in reality, all the
other affinities of life are imaginary. Corruption is the common father
of all. In this we all are formed; for corruption when dried, becomes
the original dust it was before it was animated. And as corruption is
the father, so the worm is both mother and sister; for here they burrow,
and this is their proper element. But, my soul, while thou knowest these
things, art thou living as one under the influence of them? Every man
may say, as Job said, and call corruption his father, and the worm his
mother and sister; but thousands while they say it, do not live as
though they believed it. To say to corruption, "Thou art my father," in
a scriptural sense, implies a heartfelt knowledge of a man's own
corrupt, fallen, and sinful state; and under a sense of sin, and a
consciousness of salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ, that soul hath
attained a self-loathing and abhorrence, so as to look to corruption and
the worms of the earth with complacency, as the -blessed asylum where
will be deposited a vile body that shall harass the soul no more. Art
thou, my soul, so looking at the grave? Dost thou so view it, as to love
it for the blessed property contained in it? Precious Jesus! thou didst
take pleasure in thy relationship with our nature, though thy holy body,
untainted by sin, was liable to no corruption "yet, in the affinities of
humanity, thou calledst thyself " a worm, and no man, a reproach of men,
and despised of the people!" Oh, the transporting thought! to know, like
Job, that thou my Kinsman-Redeemer liveth! And to know also, from a
well-founded hope and assurance in thee, that "though after my skin,
worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall
see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold for myself, and not another
for me!"</p>

<p>"Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
strength be."—Deut. xxxiii. 25.</p>
<p>What a thought that is which the word of God furnisheth, in the view
of everlasting engagements, that a suitable strength is laid up for
every emergency. God's love hath provided adequate supplies to the wants
of all his people. What strength of enemies shall be equal to the
everlasting strength of God? What shall drain the resources of
everlasting love? What shall dry up the streams which flow from an
everlasting fountain? Jesus therefore will proportion the back of his
people to the burden. His grace shall be sufficient for all: it shall be
sufficient for you, it shall be sufficient for me, for every one, for
all. Sweet thought! Oh for grace to keep it always in remembrance!</p>

30—Evening—Philippians 1:19</h3>
<p>"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."—Philip. i.
19.</p>
<p>Blessed frame of mind! when, like Paul, however unpromising
circumstances are, to be able to say, ` I know that this exercise, be it
what it may, is among the all things which work together for good to
them that love God, and are the called according to his purpose!' My
soul, do thou, once for all, mark down this one certain and
never-to-be-questioned truth: that thy God, thy Jesus, hath but one end
in view from all the providences he appoints to his people, and is
invariably and everlastingly promoting it, however to thy apprehension
at times, things seem to run counter. And when thou hast settled this in
thy mind, as a certain fixed principle, next take into the account all,
or (at least as thou canst not know all,) some of the many foundations
on which the certainty, for the accomplishment of a final issue of good
to the people of God, rests. Think of the ability, power, wisdom, and
purpose of thy Lord. Call to mind the grace, the love, the fixed
affection, Jesus bears, and from everlasting hath always borne to his
people. Then recollect the plentiful means in his own almighty hand,
which he hath, to make all purposes minister to his will, and all
creatures to become instruments of his pleasure. And when thou hast
studied, and well studied these blessed things in Christ's school, under
the supply of the Spirit's teaching, make application of the doctrine to
every event in the dispensations of thy Lord's providences and grace,
which thou meetest with through life. Art thou afflicted in soul; in
sickness of body; in want or weakness; with inward trials, or outward
evils; tempted by sin, or tempted by Satan; Jesus knows all, appoints
all, is carrying thee through all, and will finally bless thee in all.
The enjoyment of ordinances, or interruption of ordinances;
heart-straitenings in prayer, or enlargement in prayer; in short, all
things, past, present, and future; all circumstances, times, and
occasions; the blessings of heaven, yea, the very malice of hell, Jesus
will over-rule, arrange, direct, and order; that, like the hidden
springs of a machine, a beautiful design is in the whole, and not a pin
could be left out without injury to the work. Learn these things, my
soul, and get, through grace, into the practical use of those lessons,
and then wilt thou be able to say, and with the same degree of assurance
as Paul did, let thy trials be what they may, under every one of them;
"I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through the. prayer of the
faithful, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."—Heb. iv.
9.</p>
<p>Blessed motto for the close of the month, or the day, or year; after
being fatigued with the thoughts, and cares, and anxieties of life. My
soul, delight thyself in the thought of it, look forward to the speedy
enjoyment of it. Like the prophet's vision, it will come; wait for it.
No sorrow you have gone through will ever come over again. No
persecution already felt shall exactly be again practised. The same
trial shall not be again known, Every day, every hour of the day, we are
nearer home. Precious consideration. And Jesus is the rest of his
people. Lord, in thee alone I find rest; be thou my hope, and be thou my
portion for ever.</p>

31—Evening—2 Timothy 4:16, 17</h3>
<p>"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
me.—Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me."—2
Tim. iv. 16, 17.</p>
<p>My soul, think of the apostle's situation, when brought as a
prisoner, for Jesus's sake, before the council, and deserted by all.
Nay, look to an infinitely greater than Paul, when hurried away to
Pilate, and when all his disciples forsook him and fled. Make
improvement of the view of both, as it may be profitable to thyself and
thine own circumstances. There is a period coming, and, for aught thou
knowest, may be near indeed, in which no man can stand with thee; in
which the kindest earthly friend, if thou hast any, or the
tenderest-hearted neighbour, cannot minister to thy safety. When thou
art going down to the valley of the shadow of death, and the Lord is
undressing thee for Jordan's river, think of that season, and how
blessed must it then be to say, with Paul, I Though no man hath stood
with me, or can stand, yet Jesus will be with me to strengthen me.' Oh!
what blessedness is in this sweet word, notwithstanding! Though all
friends fail, though creatures of every description, and every degree,
stand aloof, unable to help; though in thyself thou hast nothing, thou
art nothing, yea, by reason of sin and unworthiness, art worse than
nothing, and can merit nothing; notwithstanding all these, the Lord will
be there, and he will stand by thee, and strengthen thee. Precious
Jesus! I need no more, I desire no other; nay, I pray every other to
depart, and leave a dying man alone: for humbly shall I say, as my Lord
hath said before me, "I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
And who shall say, how Jesus may bless me in these solemn Seasons? Who
shall describe what passeth between Jesus and my soul then? May there
not be many sweet love-tokens then given by Jesus to his people, which
before, to have shewn, would have lessened the exercise of faith? Will
not then some more enlarged views of divine love and faithfulness break
out to lighten up the passage of death? Oh! for grace, until the hour
arrives, to walk by faith in this soul-supporting and soul-refreshing
hope! And when the moment comes, who shall speak, or even conceive the
blessedness of realizing the sweet promise of Jesus, which all the
redeemed rejoice in, but none below have ever fully apprehended equal to
its vast extent: "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and
ye in me, and I in you!" John xiv. 20.</p>

1—Morning—Psalm 18:28</h3>
<p>"For thou wilt light my candle."—Ps. xviii. 28.</p>
<p>Precious consideration! It is the Lord that lighteth the candle of
his people. And if the Lord light it, what power can put it out?
Cherish, my soul, the faith this thought awakens, amidst all the
darkness around thee and in thee. Hath the Lord, indeed, given thee
light? Dost thou in his light see light? In the light of God the Father,
dost thou behold God the Son, and, by the enlightening of the Holy
Ghost, hast thou the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jesus Christ? Oh the blessedness of such a state of light, and
life, and knowledge; how is it possible then any more to be in darkness,
when the Lord himself is my everlasting light, and my God my glory? Now
consider the reverse of this in creature-enlightening. "How oft," saith
Job, "is the candle of the wicked put out!" And how exposed it is to be
every moment put out; for it is not of God's kindling. A fleeting of its
own oil will do it. What is called a thief in the candle will do it. It
may be blown out; it may be snuffed out; or if none of these causes
occur, yet of itself it must shortly burn out. "For what is our life but
a vapour?" My soul, ponder these things. Hath the Lord—lighted thy
candle? Is Jesus thy light, thy life, thy joy, thy sunshine, thy morning
star, thy all in all? And hath he risen upon thee, never more to go
down? Oh then, though all thou knowest, all thou beholdest now, is but
as the faint taper of the night, compared to the glory of that day which
shall be revealed, yet take to thyself by faith all the sweet comforts
of thy state of grace, and say, it is the Lord that hath lighted my
candle. The Lord my God will enlighten all remaining darkness: I shall
see thy face in glory, and shortly awake up after thy likeness.</p>

1—Evening—Proverbs 26:2</h3>
<p>"The curse causeless shall not come."—Prov. xxvi. 2.</p>
<p>It is a sweet thought, that the prayer of the wicked is an
abomination in the sight of the Lord. And surely the curse of the wicked
cannot injure the righteous. But it is doubly blessed when a child of
God finds a promising God, a performing God, in making their curses fall
to the ground; yea, converting their very curses into blessings. Had not
Joseph's brethren sold their brother, humanly speaking, how would he
have arrived to the government of Egypt? Had not Haman planned the
destruction of Mordecai, and for this purpose erected the gallows,
though means would not have been wanting for his own destruction, yet
the idea of hanging might not have entered the breast of the king. Yea,
had not the Jews crucified the Lord Jesus, where would have been the
triumph of the cross to his redeemed? Learn, my soul, to be looking at
these things; not by mere outward appearances, not by the event of the
moment, but by the final issue and termination of things. "The curse
causeless shall not come." This is quite enough for every believer.
Jesus will prevent, or over-rule, or make it minister the very reverse
of what the enemy designed. It shall be frustrated, or it shall be
sanctified, or it shall be productive of salutary effects, like
medicated waters, that by running over certain properties of the earth,
have their nature changed, and become wholesome and healing. Lord! cause
me to repose in thee, and if the enemy curse, do thou but bless, and all
his causeless anger will then be as nothing.</p>

<p>Oh blessed Spirit, to whom I owe such unspeakable mercies, let me,
Lord, contemplate thee this day under this gracious, kind, compassionate
office of the Comforter. Thou art indeed the Holy Ghost the Comforter.
And how mercifully dost thou sympathize with all the followers of Jesus
in their various afflictions, both of soul and body. How tenderly dolt
thou shew us our sins, and lead to Jesus's blood to wash them away. How
sweetly dost thou visit, encourage, strengthen, instruct, lead, and
guide, into all truth. And how powerfully at times, by thy restraining
grace, dost thou enable us to mortify the deeds of the body, that we may
live. Hail, thou holy, blessed, almighty Comforter! Oh let thy visits be
continual. Come, Lord, and abide with me, and be with me for ever.
Manifest that thou art the Sent of the Father, and of the Son, in coming
to me in Jesus's name, in teaching me of all the precious things
concerning Jesus, and acting as the Remembrancer of Jesus; that in thee,
by thy blessed officework, I may know, and live in the sweet enjoyment
of fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, through

2—Evening—Psalm 116:11</h3>
<p>"I said in my haste, all men are liars."—Ps. cxvi. 11.</p>
<p>Hasty words, for the most part, are not wise words. But, as the
apostle remarks, "Let God be true, and every man a liar." It should seem
that this hasty expression of David was at a time when he was greatly
afflicted. Alas! what exercises, for want of the proper use of them, in
their sanctifying properties, are men brought into! But if, from long
experience, the heart be led to a just conclusion, that man, in his best
friendship, and best intention, is too fickle and helpless a creature to
trust in, or depend upon; and from a full conviction of the hollow and
deceitful nature of the human heart, the soul is led unto God in Christ,
as the only stable and permanent security; thus changing the reeds of
Egypt, for the Rock of Israel: here it becomes not the subject of haste,
but the deliberate conclusion formed by grace, to consider every being
fallacious but the faithful Jehovah. My soul, take thy stand, this
evening, under Jesus's banner: and though thou hast been deceived by
man, yea, by every man; though thine own heart be deceitful, and
desperately wicked, so much so, that though, since grace brought thee
first acquainted with it, thou hast been making discoveries more and
more, that have astonished thee, and thou hast not yet, nor ever will in
this life get to the bottom in exploring the depths of deception; though
the world and the great enemy of souls be all in league to deceive thee;
yet shall not the whole of these deceivers prevail, nor separate thee
from the love of Christ. Jesus will make thee more than conqueror
through his grace supporting thee. As the armies in heaven, so his
faithful upon earth, "overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
of their testimony, and have loved not their lives unto death."</p>

be indeed delivered from all false pastors, all corrupt worship, and the
Lord have turned to the people a pure language, that they may all call
upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent? Shall my soul
indeed be freed, not only from all the sorrows, pains, evils, and
afflictions of sin around me; but what is infinitely better than all,
from the very being and indwelling of sin within me? Shall the fountain
of corruption, both of original and actual sin, be dried up, so that I
shall never think a vain thought, nor speak an idle sinful word any
more? Is there such a day, in which the Canaanite shall be wholly driven
out? Oh blessed thought: precious, precious promise! Oh dearest Jesus,
to what a blessed state hast thou begotten poor sinners of the earth by
thy blood and righteousness! Hasten it, Lord. Cut short thy work, thou
that art mighty to save, and take thy willing captive home from myself,
and all the remaining Canaanites yet in the land, which are the very
tyrants of my soul.</p>

3—Evening—Isaiah 55:8</h3>
<p>"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith the Lord."—Isa. lv. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever considered the blessedness in this verse, as
it concerns the great work of salvation? Ponder over it, this evening.
There is nothing, perhaps, in which there is a greater and more striking
difference than there is between our crude and contracted notions of
redemption, and the perfect and unerring thoughts of Jehovah on this
point. Our conduct towards each other is so limited on the score of
pardon, that though we may forgive a first or second offence, yet if it
be repeated too many, nature revolts at the offender, and seems to take
a kind of justification ,in withholding any farther acts of clemency.
Hence; we frame the same standard to judge by, concerning God. But with
God, abounding sin calls forth abounding grace, and, like the tide,
riseth above high water-mark, yea, overflows all the banks and
surrounding ground; so much so, indeed, that it covers the mountains,
and "If the sin of Judah be looked for, it shall not found." Hence the
prophet, in a transport of holy joy and triumph in the contemplation,
cries out, "Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He
retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He
will turn again: he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our
iniquities; and thou will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea,"
Micah vii. 18, 19. How truly blessed, then, must it be, to carry 'the
same kind of reasoning concerning God into all the departments of
thinking, in relation to himself and his dealings with us. Think as
highly as I may be able concerning him, I must fall infinitely short of
what he really is, both in the nature of his existence, and in all his
dealings with his creatures. In those points where he hath been pleased
to reveal himself, I cannot err. But if I attempt to go farther, the bar
to inquiry stops my way, and this sweet verse stand for a memorandum to
inform me': "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
ways my ways, saith the Lord." Now grace rejoiceth in this discovery,
while proud unhumbled nature revolts at it. Say, my soul, dost thou feel
delight in such views of Jehovah? Is it blessed to thee, that in all thy
Jesus hath taught thee, he hath brought thee to see more and more thy
nothingness, thy littleness, and the Lord's all-sufficiency? Surely it
must be divine teaching alone that can create joy in the heart, when
such discoveries are made which tend to humble the creature and exalt
the Creator. Blessed be the Lord, who teacheth me to profit!</p>

4—Morning—Matthew 28:5</h3>
<p>"For I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified."—Matt. xxviii.
5.</p>
<p>Is it indeed known unto my Lord that I seek him? Doth Jesus know that
I desire him more than my necessary food? Ye angels of light that
watched over his sepulchre, do ye witness for me that he is more
precious to me than gold, yea, than the golden wedge of Ophir. And can
I, do I, humbly appeal to him that readeth the heart, and knoweth all
things, and say, "Thou knowest, Lord, that I love thee!" Be comforted,
then, my soul: he whom thou seekest will soon be found of thee. He is
near at hand. He hath never been a wilderness to his people; neither
hath he ever said to the praying seed of Jacob, "Seek ye my face in
vain." While thou art seeking him, he is looking on thee. And the very
desire in thine heart of seeking him, it is Jesus hath kindled. And
nothing can be more sure than that he who kindled them in thine heart,
did not kindle them in vain. Sweet thought; I bless thee for it, thou

<p>"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest
be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the
shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
eye-salve, that thou mayest see."—Rev. iii. 18.</p>
<p>My soul, take advice of thy Lord, for he is a Wonderful Counsellor,
and all these blessings will be thine. He will cause thee to inherit
substance, and fill all thy treasures; yea, he will give thee durable
riches and righteousness. If Jesus clothe thee with the robe of his
salvation, thy nakedness will be indeed covered; but no fig-leaves of
thine own gathering and sewing together will do this for thee. If Jesus
but anoint thine eyes with the precious anointing of his Holy Spirit,
thou wilt both see and know the way to buy this tried gold. Now, pause
over this sweet verse, and ask thyself, how thou shalt buy this golden
treasure? What is the treasure, but faith? For the Holy Ghost calls it
precious faith; "Yea, more precious than gold that perisheth, though it
be tried with fire," 1 Pet. i. 7. And if thy Lord, who gives thee
counsel to buy, will sell this article to thee, as he sells it to all
his people, "Without money and without price," it will get for thee
every thing thou needest, to cover and to clothe, to give sight, and to
gain substance. It will become both meat and drink; and house and home;
it will keep thee from every danger; yea, and preserve thee to his
heavenly kingdom. It will form a complete livelihood, for "The just live
by faith;" and as to riches, there are none, properly speaking, that
deserve to be called so, but "The rich in faith, and heirs of the
kingdom." So that if thou make this purchase, here is a title to all
that God in Christ is to his people. God himself, thy Father, is thine;
Christ, with all his fulness, is thine; the Holy Ghost, with all his
blessed influences, is thine. The promises are all thine; all the
blessings of grace are thine; and all the inheritance of glory is thine.
And let Satan vent whatever rage he may, as thou art going home to thy
Father's house, yet, by following the counsel of Jesus, and buying of
him gold tried in the fire, by thus taking the "Shield of faith, this
will quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." Precious Jesus! give me,
Lord, I pray, thee, grace to follow thy counsel, and to buy of thee this
gold tried in the fire, and bless both the counsel and the Wonderful
Counsellor, who both counsels and inclines my soul to follow what my
Lord hath said, and to enjoy in him all things which make for my present
peace and everlasting happiness.</p>

And what hath this Sovereign done for thee, my soul? Oh record his
praise; tell it to saints and sinners all around. This great, and
glorious, and condescending King, hath not only brought thee out of
darkness and the shadow of death, but hath brought thee into his
chambers. What chambers? Chambers of sweet communion and fellowship;
chambers of love, of grace, of mercy, of redemption, of ordinances, and
of all covenant blessings. He hath taught me of his love, and my
privileges in him, and so assured me of my everlasting safety in him and
his finished salvation, that by and by, when from those outward chambers
of grace, he hath accomplished all his blessed purposes concerning me,
he will bring me home into his inner chambers of light and glory, from
whence I shall go out no more, but dwell in them, and in the presence of
God and the Lamb, for ever and ever. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>"And lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of
God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo, a voice from
heaven, saying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased."—Matt. iii. 16, 17.</p>
<p>Take thy stand, my soul, this evening by the river Jordan, and by
faith behold the wonders displayed in the hour thy Jesus entered upon
his public ministry. Behold a decisive proof of the distinct personality
in the threefold character, which all the sacred volume of the
scriptures gives to the revelation of the Godhead. Behold Jesus, the
uncreated word, on the bank of Jordan! Behold the Holy Spirit, hovering
as a dove on his sacred person! And hear the voice of God coming from
heaven, proclaiming who Jesus was, his relationship to him, and his
approbation of him. And when thou hast duly pondered the precious
testimony, bend thy knee in adoration, love, and praise, to the sacred
Three in One, for so condescending an act of grace, in confirmation of
the faith once delivered to the saints. Nor quit the hallowed spot until
thou hast well and duly considered the blessedness of the proclamation
given from heaven by the Father, to the person and character of the Lord
Jesus. John the Baptist was taught to form his conclusion of Christ by
this very evidence. He that sent John to baptize, had said unto him,
"Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him,
the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw," said
John, "and bare record, that this is the Son of God." And do thou, my
soul, take thy confidence from the same precious testimony; and then ask
thyself another question: Is he whom the Father declared to be his
beloved Son, thy beloved Saviour? And while God declares himself well
pleased with him as thy Saviour, art thou well pleased with him also in
this precious character? If to these questions thou canst truly say,
yes, yes; thou wilt find a blessed testimony indeed, and a soul
refreshing consolation in this view of Jesus. Go then, in all thy holy
exercises of faith and prayer, go to thy God and Father in Christ Jesus,
and plead for all thou standest in need of, for the life that now is,
and that which is to come, upon this footing: that in Him, in whom God
hath declared himself well pleased, thou art well pleased; and for his
blood and righteousness sake, thou seekest every supply of grace here,
and glory hereafter. This will be a sure plea, and such as can never
fail. And he that proclaimed, by a voice from heaven, his perfect
approbation of Jesus, as a Saviour for poor sinners, will give, for his
sake, every thing that poor sinners can need during a life of grace,
until consummated in glory.</p>

assurance of his love. And wilt thou not feel thine whole affections
going forth in continual love after him? Was it not thy Father which,
from everlasting, gave thee Jesus as thy Saviour, and gave thee to Jesus
that he might redeem thee? Was it not from the same precious source that
Jesus came as a Saviour, and a great one, to redeem thee and other great
sinners? Is it not thy Father that hath adopted thee into his family in
Jesus, and given thee the Spirit of adoption, whereby thou criest, Abba,
Father? And doth he not accept thee in Jesus, bless thee in Jesus,
nourish thee with the body and blood of Jesus, clothe thee with the
righteousness of Jesus, and give thee all temporal, spiritual, and, by
and by, will give thee all eternal blessings in Christ Jesus! Nay, even
his chastisements have nothing in them of wrathful punishment, but
fatherly love and mercy in Jesus. Oh my soul, pause, and behold what
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon thee, that thou shouldest
be called a child of God. And wilt thou not then from henceforth and for
ever say unto him in Jesus,—"My Father, thou art the guide of my youth;
for thou hast commanded me so to call thee." Jeremiah iii. 19.</p>

<p>"In that day, sing ye unto her, a vineyard of red wine. I the Lord do
keep it, I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it
night and day."—Isaiah xxvii. 2, 3.</p>
<p>And in what day, but the gospel day, could this song be sung with
greater justness? Christ's church is indeed .a vineyard, hedged in, and
fenced round, from the world's wilderness; so that all within it may
well sing this song in Judah, when God hath made it like a strong city,
and appointed "salvation for walls and bulwarks." Yea, God himself hath
sung to his well beloved Son, this song of his beloved, touching his
vineyard. But what is the red wine of the vineyard? Red wine of Judaea,
was of the choicest grapes; and surely the blood of Christ is the
choicest of all blessings to the sinner's view. Now, my soul, mark the
sweetness of Jesus's promise; it is he who engageth to keep it; yea, to
have his eye upon it night and day, lest any hurt it; yea, not only to
keep it, but water it, and that every moment: so that he is both a fence
and a refreshing, a covert from the storm and as rivers of water in a
dry place; and; like some rich luxuriant tree in a sultry land, not only
forms a shade to shelter the poor sun-burnt traveller from the heat, but
also affords fruit to slake his thirst, and to feed him; so that while
he is strengthened in his journey, in resting under its branches from
his fatigue, he may find occasion also to bless God, both for protection
and support. And art thou, blessed Jesus, all this, and infinitely more,
to thy people? Art thou the tree of life in the paradise of God? Dost
thou keep thy church, thy vineyard, night and day, that none shall hurt
it; yea, and water it every moment, and every individual soul of thine,
of the plants of thy Father's planting? Help me, then, thou blessed,
gracious Lord! Help me to feel all that confidence which is suited to an
entire dependence upon thee! Sit down, my soul, under "the shadow of thy
Lord, with great delight, and his fruit will be sweet to thy taste."</p>

<p>"And yet there is room."—Luke xiv. 22.</p>
<p>Room! where, and for whom? Room in the gospel of salvation, and for
poor perishing sinners, in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ.
Room in the heart of God the Father, in the love, grace, mercy, and
peace of God the Son, and in the teachings, influences, and fellowship
of God the Holy Ghost. Room in the plentiful provisions of grace, the
calls of the gospel, the ministration of the word and ordinances in the
house of prayer. "Whosoever will," is the gracious invitation; whosever
feels his heart made willing in the day of God's power, "let him come
and take of the water of life freely." Lord, is there room for me?
Thousands, and tens of thousands have found room through thy grace
inclining them to come; and yet the scripture sweetly saith again this
day, "And yet there is room." Oh give me grace to see that I am one of
the invited, one of the happy number that hath found room; and from
experiencing the blessed fulness, riches, grace, suitableness, and
all-sufficiency in the blood and righteousness of Jesus for poor
sinners, I may proclaim every where around that others may find the
same; that yet there is room. And Oh Lord! grant, that while yet there
is room, multitudes that are ready to perish may come. And then all thy
royal guests whom thou bringest to thy banquet, and who find room in all
the mercies of Jehovah for redemption here below, will find room in the
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>

7—Evening—Luke 9:34</h3>
<p>"And they feared as they entered into the cloud."—Luke ix. 34.</p>
<p>My soul, here is much instruction for thine evening thoughts to be
employed upon. Sit down, and take a leisurely view of the situation of
the disciples of Jesus, at this hallowed season, on the mount. The Lord
Jesus was about to manifest to them somewhat of his glory. But the
prelude to it was infinitely solemn. "They feared as they entered into
the cloud;" though, when there, Jesus was going to open to their souls
the richest enjoyment of himself. And is it not so with all the sweetest
manifestations which the Lord makes to his people? Seasons of sickness,
bereaving providences, afflictions from the world, disappointments,
crosses, and the like; these are like the cloud to the disciples, as we
enter them; but what gracious events have we found folded up in them,
and when opened to our view, how much of Jesus's love, and grace, and
glory, have come out of them, which, but for the dispensation, we must
have lost. And recollect, my, soul, as thou lookest back, and tracest
the divine hand leading thee through dark and trying providences, in how
many cases, and in how many instances, though the cloud was frowning as
thou didst enter, the most blessed sunshine soon after broke in upon
thee. Precious Jesus! choose for me in every circumstance yet remaining
to be accomplished. I know not what is in thy sovereign appointments
concerning me; but sure I am that both love and wisdom are at the bottom
of all. Give me grace to enter the cloud, be it what it may, without
fear, because I know Jesus is with me; and though, in this my day, it be
neither clear nor dark, yet well I know all shall be well in thee and
from thee; "and at evening-time it shall be light."</p>

<p>Mark, my soul, the character of God's Israel, and remember that they
are the same in all ages. Distinguishing mercies are sweet mercies.
God's people dwell alone, in the everlasting appointment of the Father,
by whom they were set apart, and formed for his glory, and given to his
Son. They dwell alone, in being brought into the church of Jesus as the
redeemed and purchased by his blood. They dwell alone, under the sweet
influences of the Spirit, by whom they are known, distinguished,
regenerated, and sealed unto the day of redemption. Thus set apart, thus
formed, thus given, thus redeemed, thus purchased, thus sealed, surely
they, are not reckoned among the nations, but are supposed to shew forth
God's praises, who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous
light. My soul, what sayeth thy experience to these things? Oh how
different the state, the circumstances, the new birth, the fellowship,
pursuits, way, life, and work of God's people front the world! Blessed
Jesus, cause me to dwell alone from the nations around; but let me not
dwell a moment without thee; but do thou come with thy Father and the
Holy Spirit, according to thy sweet promises, and make constant abode
with me.</p>

<p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
in my name, he will give it you."—John xvi. 23.</p>
<p>My soul, do not fail to remark, in this blessed promise of thy Lord,
how be hath secured the accomplishment of it. Here is a double verily if
one will not do. And this is said by the faithful witness, and the amen
of heaven. Had Jesus said but the words themselves, without a single
verily, his bare word was enough to give confirmation to faith; but when
he says, "verily, verily," repeating it twice over, how gracious and
condescending, as well as comforting and confirming, ought it to be to
our dependance upon what he hath said. But the promise itself comes in
with a blessed shall and will; and that not to any limited request or
petition, but extended to a whatsoever; as if Jesus threw the reins of
government into his people's hand. In some parts of scripture we find a
may be for our encouragement. "It may be," said the prophet, "that the
Lord of Hosts will be gracious," Amos v. 15. and this ought to encourage
a child of God in the exercise of faith, under every trial. But when God
saith, "It shall be," and confirms it with a double asseveration of
"Verily, verily I say unto you;" this sums up, all in one, every
assurance that can be desired. Pause, my soul, over the subject, and
then say, what shall be thy requests to thy God and Father, in the name
of his dear Son? Nay, do not ask for small things, while the King of
heaven hath given thee two verilies, that whatsoever thou shalt ask
shall be granted. Jesus himself doth as it were put into thine hand a
blank paper for thee to fill in, having signed and set his own blessed
and holy name at the bottom. Now what wilt thou write down? Thou hast
nothing more to do, than to follow thy Lord's example, and as he hath
written his name in the promise, do thou also write Jesus, and Jesus
only, on the whole paper. Ask of God thy Father to give thee Jesus; for
in giving him, in him and with him, he giveth all things. Lord, I would
say, give me thine own dear Son, and I need nothing more; Christ is all,
and in all.</p>

Lord, how often do I now awake with thoughts of earth, and sin, and
trifles, and vanity How have I opened mine eyes this morning?—was it,
dearest Jesus, with thoughts of thee? In that solemn morning there will
be no longer dreams, as now, even in our waking hours—for all childish
imaginations, shadows, doubts, and fears, will be done away. Precious,
blessed Lord Jesus! cause me morning by morning, while upon earth, to
awaken with sweet thoughts of thee. Let the close of night, and the
opening of the day, be with thy dear name in my heart, on my thoughts,
and on my lips; and in that everlasting morning, after having dropped
asleep in Jesus, and in thy arms by faith, may I awake up in thy

<p>"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of
our God."—1 Cor. vi. 11.</p>
<p>It is profitable at times to see our mercies, and to trace them to
their source, by considering what we once were, the better to apprehend
what we now are. "Such," the apostle saith, when speaking of the vilest
of the vile, "were some of you:" dead in trespasses and sins, hateful,
and hating one another. But now, being washed from all your filthiness,
and from all your idols, there is a justification by Christ, and a
sanctification in Christ; and by the effectual work of God the Spirit in
the heart, the believer stands complete before God, in the name of the
Lord Jesus. This is a blessed testimony to the soul of the poor sinner,
whom the Holy Ghost hath convinced of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment. For God the Father gave the promise, in the old testament
scripture, that he would sprinkle clean water upon the people, and they
should be clean. And here, in the new testament dispensation, the
fountain is opened, by which it is to be accomplished, and they are said
to be clean; yea, "both washed, and justified, and sanctified, in the
name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." So that all the
persons of the Godhead are engaged in this glorious act, to render it
secure and certain to the believing soul. See to it then, my soul, that
this be thy privilege, and that from long-tried and approved experience
thou canst take home this sweet scripture to thyself, as both "washed,
justified, and sanctified," and set to thy seal that God is true. Oh!
for grace to live in the daily exercise of faith upon it, until faith be
swallowed up, and lost in sight, and amidst the throng of the redeemed
in glory, thou shalt live at the fountain-head of enjoyment, with those
that have "washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb!"</p>

10—Morning—Hebrews 7:26</h3>
<p>"For such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens."—Heb. vii.
26.</p>
<p>What a sweet thought! surely, as a poor sinner, I need an High Priest
to act for me. I cannot, I dare not, approach in myself, and with my
poor polluted offerings, without one. But he that intercedes for me must
be himself holy, free from sin; his sacrifice holy, his obedience holy,
and in all points suited to his office and my necessities. Cherish,
then, the thought, my soul—He that is thine High Priest is all this, and
infinitely more. So holy in himself, that not the shadow of sin was in
him. So harmless, that in his mouth was found no guile. So undefiled,
that though he took all the sins of his people upon him, yet in himself
he was free from all sin. So separate from sinners, that though he took
the nature of man, yet wholly underived from man. And so much higher
than the heavens, that his own personal holiness infinitely transcended
the holiness of angels; for, while they are said to be charged with
folly, Jesus is the Holy One in whom the Father declared himself well
pleased. Meditate, my soul, on these precious features in thy Jesus, at
all times, and upon all occasions; and more especially when thou drawest
nigh the throne of grace, in and through this glorious Mediator. And
moreover, for thy further comfort. and encouragement to come boldly to
the mercy-seat, forget not to recollect the still further blessed
thought, that this holiness of Jesus is the righteousness of all his
people; for be was made sin, when he knew no sin, that they might be
made the righteousness of God in him. And as if this was not enough,
Christ glorified not himself to be made thy High Priest, but was called
to it, as was Aaron. Go then, my soul, go to the precious, the holy, the
harmless, the undefiled High Priest, Christ Jesus, in whom, and in whose
righteousness and atoning blood thou mayest always have boldness to draw
nigh, to find grace and mercy to help in all time of need.</p>

10—Evening—Mark 9:25</h3>
<p>"Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter
no more into him."—Mark ix. 25.</p>
<p>Oh! that the Lord Jesus, in a spiritual healing, would frame my
powers anew in himself, that neither dumbness nor deafness might ever
more stop my voice of praise for the cure of my soul, as the Lord healed
the poor man's son in his body! One should suppose that after the song
of salvation had been once chanted in the renewed heart, that heart
would never more be out of tune, nor feel a dumbness or deafness in the
Lord's praise. But, alas! so much of unbelief lies lurking within, and
so much of exercises come from without, that the harp is often hanging
on the willow, and we seldom sing to the Lord's praise, or proclaim
abroad his glory. Whereas the promise of Jehovah, in allusion to
gospel-days, was, that his Israel should, even from the valley of Achor,
find a door of hope; and the Lord added, that he would cause his church
to sing there, "as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she
came up out of the land of Egypt," Hosea ii. 15. Surely God is glorified
when, from the depth of exercises, songs of redemption still go on, and
even in the fire the believer sings his morning and evening hymn to the
praise of Jesus. Say, my soul, hath Jesus cured thee of this dumb and
deaf spirit? Art thou daily shewing forth his praises, who hath called
thee out of darkness into his marvellous light? Dost thou delight
thyself in the Lord, and delight to sing in the ways of the Lord; that
"great is the glory of the Lord?" See to it, that this be among the
evidences of a spiritual healing; for the Lord promised, in allusion to
Israel's recovery, that the ears of the deaf should be unstopped, and
the tongue of the dumb should sing. Hence all the way through the
pilgrimage state, the song of salvation should be heard from the mouth
of Zion's travellers, until they arrive in glory, where "songs of
everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, and sorrow and sighing be
done away for ever."</p>

<p>Jesus is both the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and
MORNING star; and therefore, is not this the day, the very day, the
joyful day, in which he who was set up, as God the Father's ensign from
everlasting, for salvation in the council of peace? And was he not
brought forth, and set up, and proclaimed as God's salvation to us poor
gentiles in the fulness of time, as well as the light of his people
Israel? Surely it can have reference to no other. Precious Jesus, I do
indeed behold thee as set up from everlasting. Thou wert so exhibited in
the council of peace, and thy goings forth were, from everlasting, when
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people. In the bible thou
art the great promise; and the whole of the promises. Thou art the whole
of the law and the prophets. Both the old testament dispensation, and
the new testament grace, all pointed to thee, and in thee they had their
completion. Thou art the Father's ensign of redemption, the signal of
war with sin, with Satan, and all the powers of hell and corruption.
Lord, to thee do I seek; under thy banner, and in thy strength, would I
enjoy a rest which indeed must be glorious. And Oh thou blessed Spirit
of all truth! when at any time the enemy cometh in like a flood, do thou
lift up thy ensign, even Jesus, as a standard against him.</p>

<p>"And his commandments are not grievous."—1 John v. 3.</p>
<p>Is it so, my soul, that the commandments of thy Lord are not grievous
unto thee? Surely it is; for though thou carriest about with thee a body
of sin and death, which is everlastingly harassing thee, yet thou canst,
and dost say, "I delight in the law of God after the inward man:" yea,
in the very moment that thine old unrenewed nature, when evil is present
with thee, is tempting thee to break through the hedge of divine
precepts, in thy regenerated part thou truly lovest and delightest in
the holiness of thy Lord's commandments. And are there not seasons in
thine experience, when, in spite of sin, and Satan, and the world, thou
canst adopt the language of one of old, and say, "Oh, how I love thy
law; it is my meditation all the day!" And is it not joy to thy heart,
and a blessed part of thy faith, that the law of thy God was so pure and
so strict, that rather than a jot of it should pass unfulfilled, or the
smallest breach of it go unatoned for, Jesus must and did die? And is it
not one of the sweetest and most satisfying principles to thee in the
gospel, that Jehovah did not, and would not clear the guilty, but by an
equivalent; so that, both in obedience and by sacrifice, the law is
magnified by thy great Surety, and made honourable? Precious Jesus! it
is wholly by thee, and in thee, that my soul finds the commandments of
my God to be not grievous. By faith I behold them all fulfilled in thee,
as my glorious Head; and by virtue of my union with thee, I feel the
gracious principle of thy quickening Spirit inclining my soul both to
love thy commandments, and most earnestly desiring to fulfil them.
"Lord! enable me to run the way of thy commandments, now thou hast set

<p>"And they shall come which were ready to perish."—Isa. xxvii. 13.</p>
<p>What a blessed promise is this to a poor sinner, that is conscious of
his being in perishing circumstances? My soul, pause over it this
morning. Art thou not, if considered out of Christ, in perishing
circumstances, by reason of the captivity of sin? Art thou not perishing
under the sentence of God's broken law; under the just judgment of God,
the alarms of thine own guilty conscience, the accusations of Satan, the
fear of death, and the prospect of judgment and eternity? And doth this
sweet scripture hold forth a provision for such perishing circumstances?
Doth it really say that such shall come; nay, that they shall come,
whatever obstructions, either from within or without, shall block up the
way? Will the Lord enable them, lead them, help them; nay, constrain
them to come, in defiance of all impediments? Oh precious, precious
Jesus! may the blessing of him that is ready to perish come upon thee;
for thou dost indeed make the widowed heart, and the sorrowful heart, to
sing for joy. Blessed be thy name, for that thou hast made me willing in
the day of thy power.</p>

<p>"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and
he shall say, here I am!"—Isa. Iviii. 9.</p>
<p>Mark the graciousness of thy God, my soul, in the readiness of his
answers to thy cries. He hath said, indeed, in another sweet promise,
"It shall come to pass, that before my people call, I will answer; and
while they are yet speaking, I will hear," Isa. lxv. 24. But in addition
to this, Jesus here throws in another precious assurance; for when we
call, he will not only answer, but to our cry, he will say, "Here I am!"
As if, and which is indeed really the case, the Lord would have his
children know, that he is always present with them; nearer to support,
than any of their foes can be to hurt. Now, my soul, I charge it upon
thee, this evening, that this view, and the recollection of the
everlasting presence of thy Lord, be never more from thy thoughts. How
full to the same purport is that blessed scripture: "As the mountains
are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from
henceforth even for ever," Ps. cxxv. 2. And if Jesus encircle them in
his arms, what power shall break through to wound? If Jesus himself be
their shield, what weapon shall penetrate through him to come at them?
Lie down, my soul; this night, and for ever, under these blessed
impressions. Jesus doth by thee as one whom his mother comforteth. When
the timid child is put to bed, the tender parent will sit by her darling
until he is gone to sleep. But if the child be fearful that the mother
hath left the room, frequently the child sends forth a cry, until by her
voice she quiets him again. Jesus doth this, and more: for when new
fears arise, and darkness adds to the distress, "Then shalt thou call,
(saith he,) and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say,
here I am." Oh! how blessed is the thought! I AM is always I AM; and
always here!</p>

<p>"Christ hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to

<p>If, when Noah offered by faith his sacrifice at the coming forth from
the ark, the Lord smelled a sweet savour in it, because both the ark and
sacrifice were a type of his dear Son, how fragrant and acceptable must
have been the substance, when Jesus offered himself without spot to God?
Behold him by faith, my soul, in that hour, in the full incense of his
own merit, the censer of his own offering, and the golden altar of his
own nature. And while God, even the everlasting Father, accepts Jesus as
thy Surety, in the fragrancy of his offering, wilt thou not by faith so
apprehend the sweet influence of his person, work, and righteousness, as
to rejoice before God in the sure acceptance of thyself and all thy poor
offerings in the Beloved? Oh let a throne of grace be a daily, hourly,
testimony for thee, that all thy approaches here are under the incense
and intercession of Jesus; and all thine hopes and expectations of glory
hereafter, are all founded in him and his finished salvation. Yes, thou
Lamb of God! let all witness for me, that thou and thou alone, art the
Lord my righteousness, and that I seek salvation in no other; most
perfectly assured from thine own Spirit's teaching, that there is no
other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved.

13—Evening—Psalm 34:8</h3>
<p>"O taste and see that the Lord is good!"—Ps. xxxiv. 8.</p>
<p>Those views of Jesus are blessed, which not only take in his
loveliness, but his usefulness; which tend both to commend him to our
regard, as fair and .beautiful, and at the same time full and bountiful;
that, like some rich and wide-spreading tree, yea, like the tree of life
in the paradise of God, is at once both for shelter and fruit. My soul,
look at thy Jesus thus, and thou wilt then enter into the sense of this
delightful verse of scripture: "O taste and see that the Lord is good!"
In this experience of Christ consists the proper knowledge and
apprehension of him. An hearsay account of Jesus is but a poor account.
By hearing sermons, reading the scriptures, attending ordinances, and
the like, men may acquire some knowledge of him; but until the Holy
Ghost form him in the heart, "The hope of glory," we never taste and see
that the Lord is good. It was this which distinguished the church's
enjoyment of her Lord, and which enabled her to make a suitable answer
to that question of the daughters of Jerusalem: "What is thy beloved
more than another beloved?" For when we can say, "Of his fulness have
all we received, and grace for grace;" then, and not before, can we say
also, as he did from whom this testimony was given, "I saw and bare
record, that this is the Son of God." My soul, see to it, that in your
commendation of Jesus, you can add to the account your own personal
enjoyment of him. And think what a blessedness must accompany that
recommendation of the Lord, when, like the beloved apostle, you can hold
forth Christ upon the same principles, and for the same cause as he did:
"That (said he) which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
have handled of the word of life-declare we unto you; that ye also may
have fellowship with as and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his "Son Jesus Christ," 1 John i. 1, 3.</p>

soul! Surely every poor sinner, like me, that knows his own leanness and
poverty, will feel the blessedness of it; for whether it be in the
sapless state of unawakened nature, or whether in a scorched or
languishing state from the want of the renewings of grace, nothing can
be more refreshing than such a promise. Precious Jesus, do thou revive
the languishing frame of thy people; do thou "pour water upon him that
is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground." Oh what a fulness, blessed
Lord, there is in thyself to supply all. Surely thou art, as the church
said, "A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
Lebanon." Do thou then, Oh Lord, send forth this day, this blessed day,
such copious streams from thyself, as may cleanse, revive, comfort,
satisfy, and strengthen all thy churches. Lord, cause me to drink of the
rivers of thy pleasure; for with thee is the fountain of life.</p>

14—Evening—1 John 5:6</h3>
<p>"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
water only, but by water and blood."—1 John v. 6.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder this weighty scripture well. There is much in it.
When the soldier pierced the sacred side of Jesus, John recorded the act
and its effects, as most significant and important. That it penetrated
the heart, is most evident, because from no other part of the body could
blood and water, in a full stream, flow together: and as both, in the
purposes of redemption, strikingly set forth the great object of
Christ's mission; so John is here impressing the great truth on the
minds of the church, as a matter most essentially necessary to be
regarded. He repeats it, that it might not be overlooked or forgotten.
It was not by water only, that Christ came, but by water and blood. Both
represented the necessity of that redemption our nature universally
required for the purpose of salvation, and therefore Christ came by
both. The water administered by the various washings under the law, and
the blood shed in the innumerable sacrifices; as Jesus came to sum up
and fulfil all in one, it was needful that he should come with both. And
hence, as by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost, shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, the Lord
accomplisheth that which the typical representations of the law set
forth; so by his blood he completes that also in the full price of
redemption which the numberless sacrifices on the Jewish altar were
uniformly intended to shadow. Behold, my soul, the vast and infinite
importance of the thing itself, and look, this evening, with an eye of
faith unto Jesus, who thus came, until by faith thou also not only enter
into a full apprehension of the great design of his coming, but art
perfectly assured that thou hast a personal interest therein, and that
Jesus hath presented thee, among his redeemed, to himself, a glorious
church, "not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that thou
shouldest be without blame before him in love."</p>

<p>"At our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I
have laid up for thee, Oh my beloved."—Song vii. 13.</p>
<p>Yes, blessed Jesus! at the gates of ordinances, and the word of thy
gospel, all the pleasant and precious fruits of the Spirit, which come
in new and in fresh supplies from thee, are indeed laid up. And Oh how
sweet and refreshing are they brought home and laid up in my heart by
thy divine power, when thou enablest me by faith, and in thy leadings
and strength, to go forth and bring them home, and to live upon them,
and feed upon them from day to day! And shall I not then, blessed Jesus,
by the endearing name of my Beloved, call upon thee to command the north
wind and the south wind to blow upon thy garden in my heart and in my
soul, that the spices may flow; and that then my Beloved may come into
his garden, and eat of his own pleasant fruits which his grace alone
planted, and which his Spirit bringeth forth and ripens?.</p>

15—Evening—Acts 20:35</h3>
<p>"To remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, it is more
blessed to give than to receive."—Acts xx. 35.</p>
<p>My soul, do not forget these words of thy Lord, after the Holy Ghost
had been pleased thus sweetly to give them to the church. It is
extremely probable, that Jesus had more than once expressed himself in
those gracious words to his disciples, though none of the evangelists
have recorded them. But God the Holy Ghost would have them communicated
to the church, and therefore the apostle Paul folds up his parting
sermon to the church at Ephesus with them. And blessed be that eternal
Spirit for this, among a thousand other instances of glorifying the Lord
Jesus! And now, my soul, do not forget the words of thy Lord, but bind
them as frontlets between thine eyes, and beg of the Holy Ghost to
engrave them on thine heart. Is it, my Lord, more blessed to give than
to receive? With Jesus, indeed, it hath been for ever thus: for thou
canst receive nothing but broken hearts; and we have nothing else to
give thee. Hast thou found it so, my Lord, that it is more blessed to
give than to receive? And doth thy blessedness consist in giving instead
of receiving? Yea, Lord, it is indeed thy blessedness, thy glory, thy
joy, to give pardon to guilty sinners, and grace to needy sinners. Thou
art most blessed in this barter, in giving out of thy fulness, to supply
the emptiness of thy poor pensioners, and to shed thy blood on purpose
that there might be an open and everlasting fountain for sin and for
uncleanness. Lord! may I always remember this, and so remember it as to
see, that while it is thy blessedness to give and not to receive, it is
my blessedness to have to do with One who cannot receive, but hath all
to give. Yea, thou ever blessed, ever lovely, ever gracious Jesus! let
me so remember those sweet words of thine, that I may see that it is
part of the blessedness of my Lord to give to his poor creature, and
that Jesus is made blessed and glorious by laying out his grace upon
such a poor worm as I am. Let me say, and let my faith be strengthened
while I say it, through thy grace teaching me; my God, my Saviour, my
Lord Jesus will get glory in the everlasting praises of heaven, from my
poor soul, and from every poor sinner whom he hath saved like me, in
having laid out the riches of his grace, and in saving, by his blood and
righteousness, souls that were dead in trespasses and sins: Henceforth
may I always remember the words of my Lord. It is Jesus that hath found
it "more blessed to give than to receive.".</p>

16—Morning—Isaiah 30:19</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt weep no more; he will be very gracious unto thee, at the
voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee."—Isaiah
xxx. 19.</p>
<p>Listen to this, my soul. Ponder over every precious word in it. Are
not all tears dried from thine eyes, when beholding that complete
salvation in which thou art interested in Christ Jesus? Believers are
commanded to sorrow no more, as others without hope. And doth Jesus
indeed wait to be gracious, nay, very gracious? Is it possible to
consider that He, who hath all power in heaven and in earth, waits upon
a poor worm of the dust, and this in order to be gracious? Come then, my
soul, unto the mercy-seat. Do thou wait for him, who thus waits for
thee. And as soon as thy Lord hath heard, and answered one prayer, do
thou follow it up with another. Remember that he waits to be gracious;
and Jesus is glorified, in giving out of his fulness to supply the wants
of his people. And what petitions, my soul, hast thou now before the
throne? What mercies art thou waiting for? Lord, help me to know my
need, and thy fulness to supply. Help me to be for ever bartering my
poverty for thy riches, and my sins for thy righteousness; that while
thou art coming forth to me in mercy, my soul may be going forth to meet
thee in prayer; and while Jesus is loading me with benefits, my poor
heart may for ever be proclaiming his praise.</p>

16—Evening—Isaiah 66:9</h3>
<p>"Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the
Lord. Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy
God."—Isa. lxvi. 9.</p>
<p>Observe, my soul, not only how readily the Lord undertakes to bless
his people, and mates good his promises, but the gracious manner in
which he confirms his word unto his servants, "wherein he causeth them
to hope." All the promises of God in Christ Jesus are sweet, and sure,
and amen; but methinks there is a double blessedness in those, which,
from their seeming to come to us with difficulty, the Lord recommends
yet more by bringing in the sovereignty of his power to their
accomplishment. It is as if the Lord said by every one, "Because it be
marvellous in your eyes, should it be also marvellous in mine eyes?
saith the Lord of Hosts," Zech. viii. 6. My soul, if thou wilt read once
more, this blessed evening, the gracious verse of the prophet in this
view, the beauty and glory of it will more abundantly appear. Did God
ever, in nature or in grace, fill the womb with expectation, and in the
end cause a disappointment? Look through the whole compass of creation,
and observe the appointed weeks through all his works. And will he
restrain in the new creation? Is he not pledged in covenant engagements
to people Zion with men as a flock? Is not the travail of the Redeemer's
soul to be as incalculable as the dew-drops of the morning? And shall
Jehovah cease to be Jehovah here? Shall he bring to the birth, and not
cause to bring forth? Shall he restrain or shut the womb? saith thy God.
My soul, while thou art looking at the divine faithfulness, and the
divine power, as the everlasting security for the fulfilment of all the
promises of God in Christ to Zion at large, take home the same strength
of argument (for it is the same) to thine; own security in particular.
Hath the Lord thy God brought forth to thy new birth in Jesus, all the
blessed hopes of salvation in his blood and righteousness; and will he
not go on to the accomplishment of every thing needful in grace here,
and glory hereafter to all eternity? Is any thing too hard for God?
Shall thy cold and unbelieving heart make the word of God, and the oath
of his promise of none effect? Dost thou not see that all thy security
is in God's faithfulness, and not dependent upon man's improvement? Oh,
the blessedness of ceasing from man, and resting upon God. Give me,
blessed Jesus, give me grace to look off from myself, and to be wholly
looking to thee; to live off from myself, and to live wholly upon thy
fulness!</p>

17—Morning—Revelation 19:13</h3>
<p>"And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood."—Rev. xix.
13.</p>
<p>Oh thou bleeding Lamb of God! didst thou thus appear to thy servant
John, to tell him, and the church through him, that thy priesthood and
thy sacrifice are of the same everlasting nature and efficacy as thy
person and thy finished work—"the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
ever?" And didst thou thus manifest thyself by way of assuring thy poor
needy followers that thou delightest in thine office, and lovest to be
employed? Was it not, dearest Jesus, to this end, and as much in effect,
as if thou hadst said, see, I wear these priestly garments: behold my
vesture still fresh with the blood which I offered in the day of my
sacrifice on the cross, for my redeemed, and for whom I still appear in
the bloody robe, as a proof of the everlasting efficacy. For whom, but
for my people, do I wear this vesture? "My soul, art thou looking now,
with an eye of faith, within the veil? Hast thou a blessing to ask at
the court of heaven, this day? Fly then to Jesus. Behold him still, as
John beheld him, and hear what he saith. Remember, his blood speaks; for
so the Holy Ghost declares"—it speaks better things than that of Abel;"
for Abel's blood cried for vengeance. Jesus pleads for mercy. And doth
it not speak to God for pardon, and from God in covenant promises of
pardon? Oh the blessedness to behold Jesus clothed with a vesture dipped
in blood, in confirmation that "we have redemption through his blood,
the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace."</p>

17—Evening—Psalm 63:6</h3>
<p>"The night-watches."—Psalm lxiii. 6.</p>
<p>The night-watches afford blessed seasons to the soul, when those who
know Jesus, and can and do enjoy him, wait more for his coming than they
that wait for the dawn of the morning. My soul, what saith thine
experience to the visits of Jesus in the night-watches? Hast thou ever
known any thing like the Bethel visit of Jacob, in those silent hours of
the night? When no eye hath seen thee but his, that seeth in secret, and
no ear heard but his, that wakeneth thee morning by morning; canst thou
say what hath passed between thy Lord and thee, giving refreshments of
soul, infinitely more satisfying than all the sleep of the body? Hast
thou known somewhat of these inexpressibly sweet visits of thy Lord?
Hath Jesus at times manifested himself in those hallowed hours,
otherwise than he doth to the world? Yea, hath he not sometimes awakened
thee to the call of his visit, and graciously prepared thee to the
enjoyment; and hath he not come in the communication by his word and
grace in such a way and manner, that, like the patriarch, thou hast been
constrained to consider it as the very gate of heaven? These visits of
Jesus are blessed visits. Many a child of God is so straitened in the
necessary and unavoidable labours of the day, that the cares and
concerns of himself, and perhaps of a family, or of service, too much
interrupt the life of communion with God in the soul but the
night-watches afford many an hour, when no interruption can arise, for
the enjoyment of fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
Christ. My soul, be always on the look-out for a visit from thy Lord in
the night-watches. If thou art listening, thou wilt hear his voice, as
the church of old did, saying, "Open to me! for my head is filled with
dew, and my locks with the drops of the night;" Song v. 2. And Oh! with
what refreshing dews of grace, and love, and favour doth—he come! All
the drops of the night, and the dew of the morning, are not so grateful
to the thirsty earth, as the visits of Jesus, when coming as rain upon
the mown grass, to the languishing souls of his people. Come, Lord! and
visit my soul in the night-watches; and do thou tarry with me until the
break of day, and make thyself known unto me, as thou didst to thy
disciples, while talking of thyself, and opening to me thy
scriptures!</p>

18—Morning—Proverbs 25:25</h3>
<p>"Good news from a far country."—Prov. xxv. 25.</p>
<p>From a far country, indeed; for it is no less distance than from
heaven to earth, and from beings as opposite as holiness and sin could
make-even from God to man, from a rich Saviour to poor sinners! And so
remote that had not this good news been sent, heaven must have remained
at an eternal distance, as an inaccessible region! And what is the good
news itself? The angels who were first sent to proclaim it, called it
glad tidings of good things, of great joy to all people. And indeed,
such glad tidings it contains, as language fails to describe. It is
pardon, mercy, and peace to poor rebels. It holds forth joy, happiness,
and everlasting felicity to poor sinners, enemies, and the fallen race
of men. God revealed; sin atoned; Satan conquered; death destroyed; hell
vanquished; heaven opened! And these not all. This good news informs
also of the stupendous way by which the blessings are given, and
everlasting happiness secured. Jesus, the Son of God, the author, the
finisher, the source, cause, sum, substance, beginning, end, and portion
of all his people. These, among an infinite and endless volume of
mercies, are contained in the good news from a far country: but we must
enter upon that country, to which indeed we are invited by the
proclamation of the gospel, before that we shall fully know, or even
conceive, the thousandth part of what God hath laid up for them that
love him. My soul, hast thou heard this good news? Dost thou know the
joyful sound? Art thou truly alive to the blessed things contained in
it, and anxious to be interested therein? Oh then, meditate upon them;
give thyself wholly to them. And while men of the world, from the world
are seeking their chief good, and asking one another, what news? do thou
turn a deaf ear to every other relation of a dying world, from which
thou art dying daily, and let thy meditation be all the day, and let
thine eyes prevent the night-watches to dwell upon this good news, and
this only, which cometh from a far country.</p>

18—Evening—2 Kings 7:2</h3>
<p>"Then a lord, on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God,
and said, behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this
thing be? And he said, behold; thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but
thou shalt not eat thereof."—2 Kings vii. 2.</p>
<p>My soul, do not fail to remark, from the numberless instances given
upon record in scripture, how the sin of unbelief is bound up in our
very nature. Every man is of himself disposed to it. The subtilty of
Satan induced this among the master-pieces of his devilish art. Hence
nothing but an act of sovereign grace can bring a cure. What the prophet
promised, in the midst of dearth, of so sudden and so great a supply of
bread, appeared so incredible to human reason, that this unbelieving
lord, on whose hand the king of Israel leaned, and perhaps in whose
judgment he had great confidence, brake out into the indecent
expression, that nothing less than the Lord's making windows in heaven
could accomplish it. But the event, to Israel's joy, and his punishment,
literally took place: and such was the pressure of the people for bread,
at the gate of the city, that the unbelieving lord was trodden to death.
And what is thine instruction, my soul, in the spiritual illustration of
this scripture history? The Lord need not make windows in heaven, to
rain down the bread of life for the famine of thy soul. Jesus himself,
the true bread of God, is come down, that "whosoever believeth on him
may eat and live for ever." Oh! for faith to give credit to God's
testimony of his dear Son: and both to see, and to eat of him, and to
live for ever. Lord! I would say, "Evermore give me this bread!"</p>

<p>"The strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God which giveth us
the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ."—1 Cor. xv. 56, 57.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this solemn, but yet sweet verse. "The strength
of sin is the law." Doth sin derive strength from the law? Yes, for the
motions of sin, which is in our members, gather strength from the
precepts in God's holy law, just as pent-up waters, that are increasing
from various sources, will swell and rage the more because they are
restrained. And this is what the apostle means, when he saith, "Sin,
taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
concupiscence." For the mass of indwelling corruption is stirred up, and
excited into action by the law. The Lord, in rich mercy, teaching us by
this very process; that so totally corrupt is our nature, that we do not
know the whole workings of sin, until, by the holiness of his
commandment, we are led to see, and feel a disposition to break it; like
the first transgressors in the garden of Eden, who lusted to eat of the
forbidden fruit, because it was forbidden, so that the very precepts of
God, by the sin of our nature, become the means of giving strength to
that sin of our nature. The law of God, in this instance, acts upon the
heart, as when the gardener's spade uncovers the surface of the earth,
and the worms, which before lay concealed, appear. The worms were there
before; but. they did not appear before. In like manner, the law turns
up the heart, and then appears the sin which, though there before, lay
undiscovered. Is this thy case, my soul? And dost thou still carry,
about with thee such a body of sin and death-! Well might Paul call it
the mystery of iniquity; and well might Paul, from his deeper knowledge
in the anatomy of the heart, cry out so greatly under the burden of it.
Oh precious, precious, precious Lamb of God! how little understood, and
less regarded, even by those that know somewhat of thee in the riches
and greatness of thy salvation, is it considered, in ten thousand
instances which pass away in the gulph of forgetfulness over our
unthinking minds. Lord, give me to see and feel, yet more and more, that
in myself I am virtually all sin. And, Oh Lord, give me to see and feel,
yet more and more, that thou, and thou alone, art my righteousness. And
let the apostle's hymn of praise be henceforth daily and hourly mine"
Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ"</p>

<p>"The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou givest them their meat in
due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfieth the desire of every
living thing."—Psalm cxlv. 15, 16.</p>
<p>What a full and comprehensive scripture is here! and what a view doth
it open to the mind in the contemplation of God, in all his works of
nature, providence, and grace! Pause over it, my soul, and as thou
meditatest, apply it to the several circumstances of thine own wants,
and the wants of Jesus's church in Zion: Remember, that as all eyes of
the redeemed wait upon thy God, as well as thine; so it is Jesus, and
Jesus only, that can satisfy the desire of all. Figure to thyself, at
this moment, the court of Jesus thronged with waiting petitioners! and
behold Jesus coming forth to supply, and answer all, and every one.
Think, how many, how great, how diversified their cases. And then behold
Jesus as not only having the suited blessing for all; but that when the
desire of every living thing, is satisfied, Jesus is no less full than
before; neither is an atom of the riches of his grace abated. Oh! could
this great truth but be once thoroughly impressed upon the minds of
sinners, yea, not only the needy, but wretched, worthless sinners, how
would the heavenly court be crowded day and night to watch for, and to
partake of his bounty. My soul, hasten with thy petition, for the King
is on his throne, and waiting to be gracious. And as thou goest, invite
every poor creature whom thou seest, to go with thee. Tell him there is
enough for thee, enough for him, enough for all. And tell him to
accompany thee with full confidence: for however ready and earnest his
soul is to seek, Jesus is infinitely more ready to bestow. Tell him,
moreover, that while Jesus will be making him blessed in receiving,
Jesus himself will be abundantly more glorious in giving: for it is on
such poor sinners that he makes his grace to shine. Say, dear Lord! art
thou not more blessed to the view and love of thy church in proportion
as they receive of thy grace? and the happier thy people are made in
thee, the more glorious art thou in them. And whence all this, thou
dearest Lord, but because thou art, hast been, and will be, from
everlasting to everlasting, Jesus?</p>

<p>"Christ the wisdom of God."—l Cor. i. 29.</p>
<p>Think, my soul, what wisdom is contained in that one word, and that
one person, Christ. An whole eternity will not be sufficient to read
over the immense volume. Wisdom in planning, wisdom in executing, wisdom
in completing the great salvation. And what a world of wisdom, in the
two natures united in one person-the God-man, the Glory-man, the
Wisdomman, Christ Jesus! And Oh what wisdom, in making sin, which
strikes at God's sovereignty, the very means of manifesting God's power
and love. Such is the wisdom of God in Christ, that sin, which in its
nature becomes productive of the greatest dishonour to God, should be
rendered subservient to produce the greatest glory. My soul, ponder
these things; then ask thyself, is there not a wisdom in this vast
subject, as far as it concerns thee, yet more wonderful than all? Yes,
for surely the greatest of all mysteries in this wonderful volume, to
thy view, is, that thou, even thou, shouldest be made the subject for
the exercise of such wisdom, as Christ, the wisdom of God, and the power
of God, for thy salvation. And all this even against thy determined
resolution to ruin thyself. Well mayest thou join the apostle in his
overwhelming song of praise, and cry out, "Oh the depth of the riches,
both of the wisdom and goodness of God."</p>

<p>"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said
unto him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide
at thine house."—Luke xix. 5.</p>
<p>Precious Jesus! what an instance is here of the freeness, fulness,
and sovereignty of thy grace! And was there "a needs be," O Lord, that
thou shouldest go to the place where this publican was? "a needs be" to
look up and see him? "a needs be" to call him? and "a needs be" to abide
at his house? Is this thy manner, O Lord, in calling sinners? So then it
was not Zaccheus seeking Jesus, but Jesus seeking Zaccheus. His
curiosity, as he thought, led him thither; but it was the prevenient
grace of Jesus in the poor man's heart, that first awakened that
curiosity in him. And did Jesus seek Zaccheus, call Zaccheus, incline
Zaccheus to receive him, and bring salvation to his heart and house that
blessed day? Oh! then for grace to see, and enjoy Jesus in all. Yea, I
see, Lord, now, plain enough, that all is thine; and of thine own, all
we give is from thee. When first my heart felt inclined to seek Jesus,
it was Jesus who inclined my heart to this Christ seeking. Never should
I have looked on thee, nor felt an inclination to see thee, hadst thou
not first looked on me, and given me that desire. And what it was first,
so is it now, in all the after enjoyments of thy sight and of thy
presence. If I am at any time looking after thee, I may cry out with
Abraham's handmaid, "Thou, Lord, seest me," and art looking after me.
For never, even after all my knowledge of thee, should I look to thee
with an eye of desire, except the eye of Jesus glance on me, as it did
on Peter, in quickening and awakening grace. Oh! then, thou dear Lord!
let me daily, hourly, hear thy voice calling me down from all creature
concerns, and creature confidences, to receive my Lord; and be thou
constrained by thy love to come, not as the wayfaring man, to tarry but
for the night, but to abide, and dwell, and never more depart from me.
Be thou my God, and make me thy servant for ever.</p>

21—Morning—Isaiah 11:5</h3>
<p>"And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of his reins."—Isaiah xi. 5.</p>
<p>Mark these expressions, my soul, concerning thy covenant God in
Christ. The Lord condescends by them to represent both his righteousness
and faithfulness, as they are engaged to make good the purposes of
redemption, in the Father and the Son. Jehovah's righteousness, and
Jehovah's faithfulness, are blessed securities for this purpose; for so
saith the Holy Ghost. "God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins."
Wherefore? Because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness. to
every one that believeth." And do not overlook the striking figure of
the girdle, which is chosen to represent it by; for as a man binds on
the girdle round his loins, as a strengthener; so Jehovah takes to
himself the righteousness of his dear Son. "Let him take hold," saith
Jehovah, "of my strength, to make peace with me, and he shall make peace
with me," Isaiah xxvii. 5. This is the girdle of Jehovah, which
compasseth him about, and cleaveth to him all around; so that his
people, whether they are behind or before, may lay hold of the girdle of
his perfections, and hang upon them, and depend upon them, and even when
God's providences seem to frown, or the Lord seemeth to have turned his
back upon them. Oh for grace and faith both in Jehovah's covenant
faithfulness, and Christ's righteousness, thus to trust, and thus to
stay; for he is faithful that hath promised.</p>

21—Evening—Song of Solomon 1:2</h3>
<p>"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy love is better
than wine."—Song i. 2.</p>
<p>And what are the kisses of Jesus, but the manifestation of himself to
his people? Old testament saints longed for this blessing; and new
testament believers live by the same faith in the enjoyment of it. The
cause is most evident indeed; for the love of Jesus passeth knowledge.
Nothing of the nether-springs in comforts can even describe the
blessedness of it; for corn, and wine, and oil, when they increase,
cannot satisfy those desires, which Jesus in himself and his
upper-spring mercies, can alone fulfil. Wine indeed may act as a
temporary cordial to the body's weakness, and it may for the moment
relieve worldly sorrow; but in both cases, the maladies will return,
sometimes with double violence, and baffle all its powers; nay, if wine
be used too freely, so far from affording relief, it will add
drunkenness to thirst. But thy love, blessed Jesus, never fails of its
gracious end and design. Its power and efficacy is not confined to the
relief of bodily distresses, but extends to those of the soul; yea, it
raiseth the sinner, who is dead in trespasses and sins, and infallibly
saves him from the second death. And such is its cordial and refreshing
nature, that it not only gives the body ease, but cheers and gladdens
the soul; and, unlike the juice of the grape, where large draughts
injure both; he that drinks deepest into thy love, thou blessed Jesus,
can never find an excess of injury, but delight. Every one that hath
only tasted of thy love, is constrained to cry out with the church:
"Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love,"
Song ii. 5. Shall I not then join in this sweet scripture, and say, as
she did "Let Jesus kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy love is
better than wine!"</p>

22—Morning—Isaiah 55:1</h3>
<p>"Come, buy wine and milk, without money, and without price."—Isa. lv.
1.</p>
<p>Surely, no man can plead poverty as an excuse for not buying, when
the things sold are not only without money, but without even the
proposals for money; not only without ready money, but without any
money. Here is not even a price given. My soul, remember this. The
poorer the wretch, the more welcome to this market. But what are the
things sold? Both wine and milk. A blessed variety in the gospel
feast—wine to cheer, and milk to nourish. Yes, blessed Jesus, thy love
is better than wine, and thy salvation more healing than milk: Besides,
it comes free, it comes pure, it comes in plenty. And it far, very far,
exceeds the strongest wine, and the richest milk. For though wine may
remove a temporary heaviness, yet was it never known to raise the dead;
but thy love, blessed Jesus, hath raised, and will keep alive for ever,
sinners dead in trespasses and sins, and preserve the languishing graces
of thy saints. Come then, my soul, obey the gospel invitation of this
day, and every day; come, buy these precious things without money, and
without price. Come, ye poor, needy, perishing, sinners; come, every one
of you, and buy, there is enough in Jesus for us all; and depend upon
it, not one of you will be sent empty away, if you come empty to be
filled, and hungry to be satisfied. This is the only mark and evidence
of every real purchaser. If Jesus, with all his blessings, be welcome to
your heart, you are welcome to take of his free salvation. Lord, I am
come this day, and every day. Now let me hear thy voice; "Eat, O
friends; yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."</p>

22—Evening—1 Corinthians 7:22</h3>
<p>"The Lord's free-man."—I Cor. vii. 22.</p>
<p>And who is the Lord's free-man? Jesus himself hath given a decided
answer to this enquiry. "Whosoever committeth sin (saith Jesus) is the
servant of sin." Now as by nature we were all born in this state of
bondage to sin, and by practice have fully manifested the stock of
servitude to which by nature we belong; we are Vassals and slaves to
sin, and in bondage to all the dreadful consequences. "But (saith Jesus)
if the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed!" John viii.
34-36. Hence then; my soul, learn what it is to be the Lord's free-man,
and the blessed effects resulting from this freedom. If this be thy
portion thou art no longer in bondage to "the curse of God's broken
law." Jesus hath freed thee from this; having "redeemed thee from the
curse of the law, in being made himself a curse." Thou art no longer
under "the penalty of sin:" Jesus delivered thee from the wrath to come,
when "He, who knew no sin, became sin for his people, that they might be
made the righteousness of God in him." Thou art no longer under "the
dominion of Sin:" Jesus hath taken away this power also; for '° the law
of the Spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus, hath made his people
free from the law of sin and death." Thou art loosed from "the yoke of
Satan:" for by the conquest of Christ on the cross, thou art "delivered
from the power of darkness, and translated into the kingdom of God's
dear Son." Thou art freed from "the slavish fears of death:" for through
death Jesus hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the
devil, and hath delivered them, "who, through fear of death, were all
their life-time subject to bondage." Are these among the privileges of
the Lord's free-man? Is it thus to be a citizen of the Jerusalem above,
which is free, and the mother of us all? Hail then, thou almighty Lord
of thy people! It is thou who hast redeemed them to God by thy blood!
And therefore to thee we wave the palm of victory, ascribing all our
salvation to God and the Lamb!</p>

<p>"If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a
burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands; neither would he have
shewed us all these things."—Judges xiii. 23.</p>
<p>Precious faith this of the wife of Manoah, and sound and conclusive
reasoning. My soul, hath the Father, who gave thee Jesus for a Saviour,
accepted thee in Jesus? Hath the Father, who sent his dear Son to be the
Saviour of the world, accepted Jesus for thy, Saviour? Hath the Holy
Ghost shewed thee the glorious things of redemption in his blood, the
forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace? And hath he
given thee to believe in the record that "God hath given eternal life,
and that this life is in his Son?" Oh then say, with the wife of Manoah,
surely the Lord would never have done all this, neither would be have
sheered me all these things, had be not intended my salvation Treasure
up, then, these past tokens of favour: consider present evidences of
mercy; and say, is not Jesus still precious? Are not my desires after
him? And small as you sometimes think your hope, yet would you, my soul,
relinquish it for a thousand worlds? Oh then, my soul, hang upon Jesus,
cleave to Jesus, hold fast on Jesus. Never would the Lord have shewed me
the beauty, glory, fulness, suitableness, and all-sufficiency of Jesus,
nor enabled my soul to hold up Jesus in the arms of my faith for
acceptance, if the Lord had been pleased to kill me.</p>

23—Evening—2 Corinthians 4:18</h3>
<p>"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not-seen."—2 Cor. iv. 18.</p>
<p>his was the blessed plan of old testament believers, under present
exercises—; to look off from the objects of sight, and to substantiate
and realize the objects of faith. They saw "the day of Christ afar off;"
and in that view, "rejoiced and were glad." By this means they brought
into present enjoyment things which—were distant; their faith acting
like those glasses which magnify and bring home whatever is remote, as
though it were nigh. Now, my soul, take instruction from those eminent
worthies of the old testament school, that "through patience and comfort
of the scriptures, thou also mayest have hope." By virtue of thine
interest in Jesus, thou hast a large property in the world to come. If
Christ be thine, all is throe. And certainly it is an extensive domain
which thou hast in Christ's bond promises, and God's covenant
securities: yea, thy right is confirmed beyond all earthly charters
whatever. God thy Father hath promised and confirmed the whole with an
oath; Jesus hath written, as well as bought it with his blood; and God
the Holy Ghost, hath sealed it with the great seal of heaven. Now
whenever thou art at any time put to it, by reason of difficulties and
exercises below; look off from all those things which are but temporal,
and take a view of those which are eternal. And while thou lookest upon
them as thine own, with a sure right of a reversionary interest after
the death of an old life, which is consuming daily, enter by faith upon
the enjoyment of them now. Do as men of the world do by their estates
and their property: the husbandman values his crops; and counts up what
the harvest, when it comes, will bring in; whereas he may be
disappointed with a blasting, or mildew, or storms, or canker-worms: but
no such events can happen to thee. The merchantman will borrow money
upon the credit of his ships returning from a foreign market;
notwithstanding many peradventures are between him and his vessels'
return but this is not thy case. Thine inheritance is certain, perfect,
sure. Hence, therefore, live by present faith upon the enjoyment of it,
and thou wilt find that this is the grand secret of all the happiness of
life. This is what the apostle declared to be the profitableness of
being godly; for it "hath the promise of the life that now is, and of
that which is to cone." So that if men oppress thee, devils tempt thee,
the plague of thine own heart be daily making thy pilgrimage
troublesome; turn from the things which are seen, and feast upon those
to which thou art hastening, which are not seen and, like those valiant
heroes gone before, "take joyfully the spoiling of thy goods, knowing
that in heaven thou hast a better and an enduring substance." For if the
Lord break up thine housekeeping, and remove thy furniture from thee, he
will shortly take thee home to his own house: and if he cause thy bed to
be taken from under thee, it will be no loss to exchange it for Jesus's
bosom. This is the cause why the old saints fainted not. Lord Jesus!
give me the same Spirit!.</p>

bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey
his voice, for my Name is in him."—Exod. xxiii. 20, 21.</p>
<p>Who can this be, my soul, but Jesus? He, and He only, who is the
whole of the covenant, is also the Messenger and the Angel of the
covenant. Jehovah hath never put his name in any other; neither given
his honour to any other. But in Jesus he is eternally well pleased, and
hath given all things into his hand. Pause then, my soul, and
contemplate this holy, this blessed, this only-begotten of the Father,
full of grace and truth. I see in Him all the glory, the sovereignty,
the wisdom, grace and goodness of the Father, and he is Jehovah's
salvation to the ends of the earth. And wilt thou then, my gracious God
and Father, send Jesus before me in all my way, to keep me, to guide me,
and to bring me in, to behold thy glory in the face of Jesus Christ, and
to dwell with thee for ever? Oh Lord Jesus! I would desire grace so to
beware of thee, so to love thee, so to obey thee, so to adore thee, so
to make thee my all in all, my life, my love, my joy, my present, my
everlasting hope and portion, that in life and death, in time and to all

<p>"But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and, how am I straitened
till it be accomplished!"—Luke xii. 50.</p>
<p>My soul, look at Jesus under his straitenings, and thou wilt find it
the best support and encouragement under thine. He had in view, when he
thus expressed himself, the water-spouts, and the billows of divine
wrath against sin, which, as the sinner's. surety, were to be poured
upon him. Jesus calls it a baptism. I cannot sufficiently admire the
word, because it is my Lord's, and because it is so applicable.
Afflictions, then, are baptisms to his people, when commissioned by his
grace, and when blessed by his Holy Spirit. Never lose sight of them, my
soul, in this view; they will be always sacred: and from the
straitenings of Jesus, until his were accomplished, do thou at all
times. fetch relief and encouragement under thine. He that felt
straitening for himself, well knew how to enlarge thine heart: and he
that knew the baptism he had to go through, knows, and hath laid in all
proper enlargements and support for thine. One look at Jesus in the
priestly vestment which he still wears, will give more comfort to thine
heart under all straitenings, be they what they may, than all thine own
laboured attempts; that without an eye to Jesus, thou canst set up: and
surely, He, who in the days of his flesh felt straitenings, will not
forget thine. Lord! bring my poor soul under the continual baptisms of
thy Spirit.</p>

<p>"Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto
David."—Psalm lxxxix. 35.</p>
<p>Wonderful condescension! Was it not enough, that Jehovah gave his Son
to poor sinners; gave his word, his promise, that all that believe in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life? But, as if consulting
the weakness of our faith, confirmed it with an oath; pledged his
holiness to Jesus, and to poor sinners in Jesus, for the sure
accomplishment of all covenant engagements, in the blood and
righteousness of his dear Son. Oh my soul, never, never more call in
question the truth of thy gracious God. Say with Job, "Though he slay
me; yet will I trust in him." What are afflictions, trials, darkness,
poverty? These are in me, and about me, but no obstructions to the
efficacy of Jesus's righteousness, or the Father's faithfulness. Read
under every one of them the charter of rich sovereign grace; hear what
God hath said, what God hath sworn: and believe the record that God hath
given of his dear Son:—"Men shall be blessed in him." Jesus shall see
the travail of his soul, and be satisfied. Here then rest, my soul. God
hath sworn once by his holiness: Jesus hath once died, the Just for the
unjust, to bring sinners unto God. Return to thy rest; the Lord hath
dealt, my soul, bountifully by thee.</p>

<p>"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it
be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God
and prayer."—1 Tim. iv. 4, 5.</p>
<p>I have often thought that there is somewhat in our ordinary meals,
and especially the evening meal, which hath a tendency to call up the
exercise of grace. Surely our family refreshments should remind us of
the Lord's family; and our own supper, of the Lord's supper. The thing
itself might well be supposed to call up our attention, and to create
holy conversation concerning Him and his table, and of that supper of
the Lamb in heaven, at which believers hope very shortly to meet as one
family, to rise up no more for ever. And, as at the Lord's table, so at
our own; every thing is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. My
soul, mark what this scripture saith, concerning our food; "Every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if received with
thanksgiving, and sanctified." God's word over it, and the prayer of the
faithful offered up with it, gives a sanctified use to all our comforts,
and brings with them a double sweetness: And, if, while receiving them,
we look to him; so that while the body feeds on his bounties, the soul
is fed on his grace; surely the heart feeds with thanksgiving, and every
creature is good. Many a poor man, by these means, hath found more of
Jesus at his own table, than thousands who perceive not Jesus, do at the
Lord's. And to be thus feasted night and morning, every service becomes
sacramental; for Christ is still the passover. Lord, make my whole use
of the creatures of thy bounty thus sanctified to me, that I may behold
and enjoy Jesus in every one!</p>

<p>Listen to this promise, my soul, and make it the subject of this
morning's meditation, of this day, and every day. See how rich, how
extensive it is in the life-promising power. And the river of life in
Jesus possesseth all these blessed effects. To every poor sinner,
brought into this rich stream, it gives life, spiritual life, eternal
life. And who shall describe the length, the breadth, the heights, the
depths of it? Not only extending over all the continent of the earth,
but from the borders of hell to heaven, and from one eternity to
another. And its sovereignty is such that it bears down all before
it—washing away sin, and guilt, and misery; diffusing streams of life,
and grace, and mercy; opening sources of joy, and peace, and happiness,
for ever and for ever. Oh precious, precious Jesus, make glad my soul
with the streams of this river; be thou the fountain of all my
happiness, and let all my springs be in thee.</p>

26—Evening—Psalm 45:13</h3>
<p>"The King's daughter is all glorious within."—Psalm xlv. 13.</p>
<p>As the Redeemer is known to his church under a great variety of names
and characters, and is blessed to the church in every one, whether of
brother, or husband, or friend; so Jesus condescends to call his church
by a variety of names also, all descriptive of the unbounded love he
bears towards her. She is his fair one, his spouse, his chosen, his
sister; and in this song of loves, she is called "the King's daughter."
But it is most blessed to observe that by whatever name she is known, it
is all in allusion to Jesus, for from him, and in him, she derives the
whole of her beauty and excellency. Her glory is in her Lord, and she is
wholly spiritual, all derived, like the shining of the moon, from the
sun. If the church be comely, it is from the comeliness the Lord Jesus
hath put upon her. For as the whole perfection of beauty is in Christ,
as a rich and complete constellation, so every perfection in his people
is from their union with him. It is Jesus who gives a loveliness to
every object that is lovely. My soul, what saith thy experience to this
statement? Thou art indeed "all glorious within," if Christ be formed
there "the hope of glory." And if thy God be thy glory, then wilt thou
feel what the church felt, and, taking tip her language, thou wilt say,
"I am black as the tents of Kedar but comely as the curtains of
Solomon," Song i. 5. Oh! the felicity of knowing the total unworthiness
of the human heart, which, like the spots and swarthiness of the
Ethiopian, makes the church truly black and deformed: and Oh! the
felicity also of knowing our comeliness, from the beauty Christ hath put
upon us, and the sanctifying and regenerating influences of the Holy
Spirit. Precious Lord Jesus! be it my portion always to appear in the
spotless robe of thy righteousness, and then shall I be indeed "all
glorious within!"</p>

<p>Blessed promise to my poor soul; sifted, blown about by temptation.
Look then to Jesus with it, and plead it under every new sifting time.
Corn must be sifted, for it is much covered at times with tares and
chaff. And so must the seed—of Jesus, that the precious may be known and
separated; "for what is the chaff to the wheat?" saith the Lord. Oh
Lord, if it please thee, for thou knowest the necessity of it, sift me,
try me, separate me, not only from the ungodly, with whom I am
constrained to dwell, but from myself, from my own trifling, vain
conversation, from the corruption of indwelling sin in my fallen nature,
from the vain thoughts which lodge within me. Yes, precious Jesus; sift
all, and every thing which is unsuitable to thee, and let the whole fall
through the sieve, that thou alone mayest remain with me, for sure I
know my God hath said, though his Israel be sifted, yet not the least
grain of the true wheat shall be lost.</p>

<p>"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."—Luke
vii. 5.</p>
<p>What a very interesting character is given, though but in few words,
of this honest centurion. Though unconnected with Israel, and a Gentile,
yet he loved the Jews. Was he, like another Rahab, partaker of the
faith, and though unconscious of it, had a part in Jesus? It is most
blessed to behold such rich provisions in grace, making way for the
calling of the people, both Jew and Gentile, in that plan of redemption,
"given in Christ Jesus before the world began!" But we must not stop
here, in our view of the centurion. He not only loved the Jewish nation,
but gave proofs of that love in building them a synagogue. Surely
nothing short of grace in the heart could have wrought such acts of love
and affection to Israel, and to Israel's God, in a Gentile mind! But,
while admiring this gracious conduct in the centurion, and admiring
still more the blessed author and giver of that grace which wrought it
in his mind; is it possible not to have the affections instantly and
irresistibly directed to thee, thou blessed Lord Jesus, who, as far as
light transcends darkness, or the heaven is higher than the earth,
surpassest every other pattern of excelling charity? Of thee, thou dear
Redeemer, it must be truly said, "thou lovest our nation," and hast
built us indeed, not a synagogue only, but art thyself our
dwelling-place for ever! For thy love brought thee from heaven, prompted
thee to live for us, to die for us, to rise again for us, and to take
possession for us of the glorious tabernacle, not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens. Yea, Lord Jesus, thou so lovedst us, as to
accomplish this vast, this wonderful, this never before heard of
undertaking, and never more to be undertaken, of laying the foundation
in thy blood!. My soul, what wilt thou render to the Lord for all his
benefits? Oh take the cup of salvation, and call upon his name. Tell the
whole world how he hath loved, and how he hath founded Zion, and is and
will be her King for ever!</p>

<p>My soul fold up this sweet and precious scripture, and carry it about
with thee in thy bosom, and in thine heart, that it may help thee on at
any time, and at all times, when thy strength seems gone, and there is
no power left. Was it not when the whole nature of man was without
strength, that Christ was given of the Father? And was it not equally
so, when Christ came to seek and save that which was lost? And was it
not in due time when Christ died for the ungodly; due time in his
resurrection, due time in his ascension, "when he ascended up on high,
led captivity captive, and received gifts for men, yea, even for the
rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them?" Go further yet,
my soul, as it concerns thyself was it not due time indeed, when Jesus
passed by and saw thee in thy loathsome state of sin, cast out to
perish, and when no eye pitied thee, that then his eye compassioned
thee, and bid thee live? Who more ungodly than thee? Who more weak? Who
more undeserving? Did Jesus then look upon thee, call thee, strengthen
thee when thou wast without strength, and hath helped thee to this hour?
Oh then, trust him now, trust him for ever. "His strength is made
perfect in thy weakness." And depend upon it, when thou art most weak in
thyself, then is the hour to be most strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might. He that in due time died for the ungodly, will be
thy strength in due time of need.</p>

thy grace, I have eaten them, and they are as honey and the honey-comb
to my soul. In them I find my God and Father in his covenant
engagements, all pledged in faithfulness to his dear Son, to be the
everlasting and unchanging portion of his redeemed. Oh! what unknown,
what unspeakable blessedness do I find in that one promise; "I will be
their God, and they shall be my people!" Here also I find Christ and his
fulness; the Holy Ghost and his graces; the whole covenant and its rich
promises: all, all secured, made over, and co-operating to the assurance
of salvation! And how then can thy word, Lord, wherein thou hast caused
me to hope, be otherwise than "the joy and rejoicing of mine heart?" I
have Jesus in all, and his promises in all, and therefore can never fail
of all that is here engaged, since all the promises of God in Christ
"are yea and amen!" Oh then, let thy word continue "as a lamp unto my
feet, and a light unto my path;" which will shine all the way through,

poor sinner that is awakened, until the day of glory breaks in with an
everlasting light upon him, get away to the gospel mountain, where the
odour of Jesus's incense, and the savour of his blood and righteousness,
become sweeter than myrrh, and more fragrant than frankincense. Here,
Lord, cause me to get away from all surrounding impediments, and to be
constantly found waiting, that my soul may drink in the fresh, reviving,

my soul, to lead me home to his everlasting glory, in his bosom for

29—Evening—Mark 8:24</h3>
<p>"And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking."—Mark viii.
24.</p>
<p>I have often considered the case of this man as holding forth a sweet
and comfortable lesson of instruction, to the small attainments of the
followers of Jesus. Perhaps our gracious Lord, in the method he was
pleased to adopt, in the opening of this man's eyes by gradual means,
intended so to instruct his people. My soul, look at it in this point of
view; it may be profitable to thee. When the Son of God, who came to
give light to the spiritually blind, as well as to restore vision to the
eye of the body, first touched this poor man's eyes, the effect was that
when he looked up, the men he saw were only like "trees, walking;" the
sight was imperfect, and the objects obscure. And such is it very
frequently in our apprehension of spiritual things; but then it should
be remembered, and remembered with great thankfulness, that this
imperfection of our sight differs altogether from total darkness.
Objects we certainly see, though we do not clearly see them as we
desire. If I see "men as trees, walking," it is past a doubt that men I
see; and by a parity of reasoning, if, in a spiritual sense, I see Jesus
in his suitableness, fulness, and all-sufficiency, for a poor sinner;
though I long to see more of him, and to see him more plainly, yet the
sight I now have is blessed, and being wrought by his own gracious
hands, it begets a lively hope that he who hath begun the cure will
perfect it. The way to ascertain the reality of spiritual life, is not
unsimilar to what is done in doubtful cases in respect to animal life.
It is a sure sign of life if the body feel, however the other symptoms
of health may be suspended. There is a vast difference between deadness
and death. If a man cannot speak, yet is he conscious of what others
say? If he cannot make signs, yet can he take food? If he cannot take
food, doth he move? If he doth not move, doth he breathe? Still then
there is life. And, in like manner, the soul that is breathing after
Jesus, though he doth not move, hath life. He is looking up, like this
poor creature, and all he seeth is imperfect. But Jesus will do by him
as by this blind man; he will put his hand upon him again, and at length
he will make him to behold every object clearly. Lord, give me grace to
bless thee for all attainments, and never "to despise the day of small
things!"</p>

<p>Solemn consideration! What time is it with thee, my soul? Let me ask,
with the prophet, "Watchman, what of the night? The morning cometh, and
also the night." Perhaps there may be but a step between me and death.
Am I really awakened from the sleep of carnal security? Am I alive from
spiritual death? Am I dead to the world, but alive unto God through
Jesus Christ our Lord? Oh Lord Jesus, impress these solemn enquiries
upon my soul yet more and more, since everlasting happiness, or
everlasting misery hangs upon the decision. My beating pulse is
hastening to fulfil the appointed number. Even while I think of these
things the account is increased. Every fleeting breath is one the less
to take. Lord, make me wise to remember my latter end!</p>

30—Evening—Psalm 97:2</h3>
<p>"Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment
are the habitation of his throne."—Psalm xcvii. 2.</p>
<p>What a blessed scripture is here! And what a satisfying answer is
given in it to the endless questions which are for ever arising in the
human mind, for explaining the ways and works of God towards his
creatures! The words are as if the sacred writer had been answering such
inquiries, and had therefore made this conclusion; there must be much
darkness, which the dim view of short-sighted creatures cannot see
through, in carrying on the purposes of Jehovah: but here is an
everlasting rule to go by; righteousness and judgment are the habitation
of his throne, who is "wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working."
Oh, my soul! couldest thou call to remembrance this blessed scripture
every day, and all the day, in the several exercises of thy warfare, how
many anxieties would it save thee? I know as well as can be, in the
perfect and clear conviction of my heart, the blessed truth; but when it
comes to be put into practice, I am for ever calling it in question. I
know that Jesus is pleased very frequently to work by contrary means; it
is his province and his prerogative to quicken the dead, and to call
"things that are not, as though they were:" his strength is perfected in
weakness; and he sometimes kills to make alive, and wounds in order to
heal. But in a killing time, I am so apt to reason with flesh and blood,
that I forget the quickening time; and when the wounds are bleeding, so
that life seems running out of them, I judge it impossible that they
ever can again be healed; and hastily conclude, with the church, "My
strength and my hope is perished from the Lord;" Lament. iii. 18. Oh!
for grace to view the righteousness and judgment of my God and Saviour
as the habitation of his throne, and to rest for ever unshaken and fixed
in this most perfect assurance! Jesus cannot mistake in ordering what
shall be for my welfare; neither can he appoint any thing but what
carries the mark of his love upon it. Let me, thou dear Lord! let me
hear thy sweet voice through all the clouds and darkness which are round
about thy dispensations, and whisper to me, as thou didst to thine
astonished apostle, and then in every one, how mysterious soever it may
be, it will silence my fears: "What I do thou knowest not now, but thou
shalt know hereafter."</p>

1—Morning—Psalm 65:1</h3>
<p>"Praise waiteth for thee, Oh God, in Zion."—Psalm lxv. 1.</p>
<p>Is this the language of my heart? Am I indeed waiting until that
Jesus be ready to receive my poor praise? Hath God the Holy Ghost
prepared my heart? Oh then, hasten to him, my soul, with thy morning
offerings, poor as they are; for sure I am, Jesus is waiting to be
gracious. God will accept both thee and thy offering in him the Beloved.
Go forth to meet him as early and as often as thine heart can wish:
depend upon it, thy Redeemer will be beforehand with thee, and is
waiting thy coming. Neither thy praise nor thy prayer can outrun his
love; for both are the blessed effects of his grace, and of his own
quickenings. Precious Jesus, grant me to come as often as I need thee.
And, Lord, if thou wilt grant me this blessing, I shall never be from
thee, for I need thee every moment.</p>

1—Evening—Acts 2:46, 47</h3>
<p>"And they continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness,
and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the
people."—Acts ii. 46, 47.</p>
<p>What a beautiful picture is here given of the primitive church! My
soul, think of the happiness of the saints of God in those days, when,
instead of that idle and unprofitable conversation, which, for the most
part, fills up the employment of christians professing godliness in the
present day, believers never met without celebrating the Lord's supper
(for so the expression of eating bread from house to house means); and
their ordinary meals were conducted with a single eye to God's glory!
What a sad change hath taken place in the circumstances of christians!
"They were daily with one accord in the temple:" and thousands who would
be very highly offended, were their religious profession to be called in
question, think one part of the Lord's day sufficient to be found there.
They conversed "from house to house" of the great things of salvation:
but what parlour, what place of meeting, what house or family must we go
into, to hear of Jesus and his gospel? They were daily setting forth the
broken body of Christ, in the action "of breaking of bread and of
prayer:—" but how many are there, who think the observance of monthly
communions of Christ's body and blood too frequent, and only attend now
and then, lest the frequency of the service should lessen the reverence
due to it! My soul, look to it, that thy life be upon the plan of those
venerable followers of the Lord! Oh! for grace to make every day a
sabhath day; and every table the Lord's table! Precious Jesus! I would
pray to keep up a constant remembrance of thee, that "whether I eat or
drink, or whatever I do, I may do all to the glory of God!"</p>

<p>"It is written in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of God.
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,
cometh unto me."—John vi. 45.</p>
<p>Mark, my soul, these precious words of thy Jesus. It was one of the
old testament promises, that all God's children should be taught of him.
And as this condescension of God, in teaching, implied the Father, so
the blessed consequence and effect of it should be, that every one thus
taught proved his being a child, and inclined his heart to come to God
in Christ as a Father. My soul, art thou come? Art thou looking to,
leaning upon, trusting in, walking with, and seeking for Jesus? Is he
the Lord thy righteousness, thine only righteousness, thine only hope,
thine only confidence? Dost thou, like the apostle, count all things
else but dung and dross to win Christ, and to be found in him? Courage
then, my soul! These are blessed tokens of thine adoption character.
None but God the Father, by his Holy Spirit, could have taught thee
these things. None but He, that revealed his Son in the heart of the
apostle, could have been thy teacher. Thou hast both heard and learned
of the Father, and in proof thereof thou art come to Christ for life and
salvation. Fold up then this precious scripture in thy bosom for thy
daily use, and examine thine interest in Christ continually, by a mark
so sure and infallible. And remember what the Lord Jesus hath said, as a
collateral testimony to the same blessed truth: "All that the Father
giveth me (saith Jesus) shall come to me: and him that cometh I will in
no wise cast out."</p>

2—Evening—Song of Solomon 5:2</h3>
<p>"I sleep, but my heart waketh."—Song v. 2.</p>
<p>My soul, behold the church fallen into a sleepy state, after having
been at the banquet of her Lord; and view in her the resemblance of
thyself. How often art thou in this cold and lifeless situation; and
instead of seeking increasing communion and fellowship with Jesus,
falling asleep, as one insensible to past enjoyments and present need!
It is not indeed the sleep of death; for, through the sovereignty of
almighty grace, thou hast been quickened to a new and spiritual life in
Christ Jesus; and thine heart waketh to the knowledge of thy Lord. But
how unsuitable and unbecoming is it, for one who hath tasted that the
Lord is gracious, to be indifferent to the farther enjoyment of him!
Time was, when, if thou didst miss Jesus in the ordinance, or hadst not
a visit from thy Lord for a short space, thou wert on the wing of love,
going forth in every way, and in every direction, in the inquiry, "Saw
ye him whom my soul loveth?" And canst thou, my soul, be contented to
live in this sleepy frame, and without the visits of thy Lord? Look up
to Jesus, he is near at hand, and waiting to be gracious! Listen to his
voice, in his word, in his ordinances, in all the means of his grace;
hasten to the awakening ministry of some one of his faithful servants.
These methods the Lord will bless. Jesus will come again: he will do by
thee, as he did by the church, "He will put in his hand by the hole of
the door, until that thy bowels are moved for him." Precious Lord Jesus!
keep from me all sleepy lifeless frames! Give me day by day, to be
pressing after some renewed tokens of thy love; and let each mercy
quicken my poor soul to desire farther manifestations that in greater
degrees, and more frequent enjoyment of thee, I may, like, thy servant
the apostle, "forget those things which are behind, and, reaching forth
unto those which are before, press toward the mark for the prize of the
high calling of God in Christ Jesus?" Amen.</p>

3—Morning—2 Corinthians 8:23</h3>
<p>"Whether our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the
churches, and the glory of Christ."—2 Cor. viii. 23.</p>
<p>What a blessed account is here given of the children of God to all
inquiries concerning them. See, my soul, whether thy experience
corresponds to it, and mark their character. They are not only brethren
to one another, but to Christ also; for we are told that he is not
ashamed to call them brethren. Precious condescending, Saviour!
Moreover, they are the messengers of the churches. What is that? A
messenger, in scripture, is called also an angel. And if the brethren of
Jesus do know, and can speak of him as his people should, then are they
like angels come down from the court of heaven, to relate what they have
seen and known, of the King in his beauty, and their hearts glow with a
warmth of earnestness to proclaim his glory, and his love to poor sinful
creatures here below. Neither is this all. For they are the glory of
Christ. Mark this, my soul, and dwell with rapture upon it. A true
believer in Jesus is the glory of Jesus. Not only because he gives glory
to the Redeemer for his grace; but because Jesus derives glory from his
redemption. Not only because the poor sinner hath everlasting happiness
from Jesus; but Jesus hath everlasting glory from that poor sinner's
salvation. Never lose sight of this, my soul, when thou goest to Jesus.
Indeed, indeed, Jesus is glorified in receiving thee, in pardoning thee,
in blessing thee, in giving to thee of his fulness. And the Father is
glorified in this great salvation by his Son. Oh what encouragement is
this to faith; what inducement to come to Jesus! Lord, how ought I to
blush when I think how little glory I give to thee in not seeing that
thy church and thy people are thy glory, in being saved and redeemed by
thee.</p>

3—Evening—1 Kings 19:7, 8</h3>
<p>"And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched
him, and said, arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.
And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that
meat forty days and forty nights, unto Horeb the mount of God."—1 Kings
xix. 7, 8.</p>
<p>How blessed is it to observe, in the several instances of God's
people, that the Lord measures out strength in proportion to their
wants, and fits every back for the burden. The prophet was obliged to
flee from the king's court, but the King of kings will give him a table
in the wilderness. Elijah shall be taught at one time, how to live by
faith, when fed by ravens; and at another, how to go forty days and
forty nights without food, when sustained by grace in going to Horeb. My
soul, canst not thou find in thy experience, similar exercises of faith;
if not so splendid, yet at least no less profitable? Hath not Jesus many
a time fed thee at his banqueting house, and made thy cup run over, when
telling thee, in some sweet communion visit, either at his table or
thine own, either in the church or in the closet, how suited his grace
is for thee, and that his strength is perfected in thy weakness? And
hath not Jesus, as in the instance of Elijah, touched thee a second
time, yea, and a third, and many a time; and laid in refreshments for
thee, against the coming hour of trial, when the journey of spiritual
exercises, that were to follow, would otherwise have been too great for
thee? Knowest thou nothing of these things? Surely, in such trainings as
these, the Lord is as much leading on his people now, as he did of old.
Doth he come in a full tide of glory, and shew himself to be Jesus, and
open to our spiritual sight his pierced hands, and his side? Doth he
come into the soul as the King of glory, openly manifesting his
refreshing, his comforting, his strengthening, his loving presence; and
at the same time, opening our eyes and hearts to receive him; so that
the soul is made joyful, and brought as into the very suburbs of
heaven?—Mark what follows: perhaps, as in the case of the prophet, a
long abstinence is to follow. Jesus hath therefore laid in a store of
comforts. He hath victualled the ship. He hath fortified the garrison.
"The just shall live by faith." Precious Jesus! give me to live on thee,
when all outward comforts fail. In fulness or in famine, in life or
death, if I have thee, I have enough to live upon, and in thy strength
to go forty days and forty nights; yea, for ever, to the mount of God in
glory!</p>

<p>"Come, see the place where the Lord lay."—Matt. xxviii. 6.</p>
<p>Lord, I would desire grace to accept the call, for it is always
profitable to have faith in lively exercise: I would pray that my
meditation might frequently take wing, and view the memorable sepulchre
of my Lord. Did Jesus once lay in the grave? Surely death never had such
a prisoner before! But did Jesus lay so low for me? Am I shortly to lay
there? Sweet consoling thought! The grave is now softened, and the
chambers of death are perfumed with the fragrancy contracted from his
holy incorruptible body. But is there not another place where the Lord
lay? And doth not the angel invite his people to see him there also?
Yes, Jesus lay in the bosom of the Father from all eternity. And doth he
not lay there now, and will he not through all eternity? But can I see
him there? Yes;—for if by faith I behold Jesus as the Christ, the Sent,
the Sealed of the Father; in seeing him, I see the Father also. He saith
this himself, John xiv. 9. And again, John xiv. 20. "At that day ye
shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you." Blessed
assurance! Jesus is one with the Father, and all his people one with
him. And as he is in the bosom of the Father, so are they in his, and
there shall dwell for ever and ever. Hallelujah. Amen.</p>

4—Evening—Isaiah 24:15</h3>
<p>"Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires, even the name of the
Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea."—Isa. xxiv. 15.</p>
<p>My soul, hast thou ever considered, in how many ways, and by what a
variety of means, every poor sinner called by grace, is furnished with
ability to glorify God in Christ? It is blessed to see this, and doubly
blessed to be employed in such a service. The poor sinner not only
glorifies Jesus, actively, when he is praising him; but passively also,
when his wants and necessities afford occasion for Jesus to be glorified
in giving out of his fulness to his relief. And how is the Lord
glorified in the fires? Evidently when in the furnace of affliction, or
in the fire of temptation, the poor exercised soul glories in his
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon him! when he can,
and when he doth receive all, and take all, and feel happy under all,
from the consciousness that the Lord's hand is in it, and the Lord's
blessing will be upon it. "I was dumb, (said one of old) and opened not
my mouth, for it was thy doing." And another ancient sufferer cried out,
"Why should a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his
sins?" Oh! it is most blessed to see a child of God, thus engaged for
God, when matters are most dark and discouraging! It is easy,
comparatively speaking, for a man to praise and give glory to the Lord,
when all things around him are gay and smiling: but when songs are heard
from the fires, and when the soul feels its own wretchedness, and cries
out under it, "My leanness, my leanness!" and is looking to a God in
Christ; here is a flame of mind suited to the divine glory. My soul, see
that all try glory be centered in Jesus, and on God in Jesus, as the
name of the Lord God of Israel. And Oh! for grace to give him both the
praises and the glory, in whom "all the seed of Israel shall be
justified, and shall glory!"</p>

5—Morning—Isaiah 53:10</h3>
<p>"It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief."—Isa.
liii. 10.</p>
<p>The depths of wisdom were explored to furnish redemption, and to find
a person competent to accomplish it; and when found, the depths of love
were broken up, to make it complete. My soul, read over the mysterious
volume which the Lord hath in part opened before thee. It cost the
Father his thoughts from ail eternity, to appoint a plan, by which,
consistently with leis holiness and his justice, thou mightest be saved.
It cost the Father his Son, his dear Son, his only Son, before that thou
couldest be redeemed. Jesus must die ere thou canst live. Pause over the
subject as it is here expressed. "It pleased the Father to bruise him."
Jesus, who was in himself holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
sinners, and made higher than the heavens; he, who knew no sin, must be
made sin; he who never merited wrath, must be made a curse. Read on;
Jesus must die! and by whom? Not by Jews, nor Gentiles only; not simply
by high priests and governors among men; but by God the Father. He must
bruise him, and put hint to grief; for though Jesus was taken, and by
wicked hands crucified and stain, yet all this, we are told, was "by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God." And is there yet another
chapter of wonders in this mysterious volume? Yes; what can it be?
Namely, that all this was for sinners, for rebels, for enemies; nay, my
soul, for thee. Wonder, O heavens, and be astonished, O earth! Had our
whole nature been bruised to all eternity in the mortar of divine wrath,
for the sin of our nature; what would all this have been to the
sufferings, agonies, and death of the Lamb of God? And didst thou die
for me, O thou unequalled pattern of love and mercy, and by try stripes
is my soul healed? Precious Jesus!</p>

5—Evening—Psalm 30:5</h3>
<p>"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."—Ps.
xxx. 5.</p>
<p>It is most profitable, yea, blessed, to have right conceptions of the
Lord's dealings with his people. Jesus' is everlastingly pursuing one
plan of love; and never, in a single instance, departs from it. But as
we see only part of his ways, until the result come, exercises by the
way much perplex our poor short-sighted view of things. Jesus, for the
most part, brings his people into the wilderness, in order to speak
comfortably to them there. But while in the wilderness, we are at a loss
to trace the footsteps of his love. And when, after some sweet
love-tokens of his favour, new trials arise, though Jesus, it should
seem, designed by the mercy to prepare for trouble, yet, by our false
interpretation of it, we aggravate the trouble, and make it greater. My
soul, do learn from the precious thoughts suggested by the scripture of
the evening, to form a right estimate of the Lord's dealings with thee.
"Weeping may endure for a night." It may appear a long night, a
wearisome night: but, remember, it is but a night. Every hour, yea,
every moment is shortening it, and when the morning comes, joy will come
with it. And in proportion to the darkness or the sorrow of the ,night,
the daylight will be more delightful. The most blessed discoveries Jesus
makes of himself, are generally those after a sorrowful night. Precious
Lord! be thou thyself the "day-dawn, and the day-star" to my soul, after
a night of painful exercise; yea, be thou "the Bun of righteousness"
with baling in try wings! And then neither the night of sleep, nor the
night of death will be more than the passing hour. And, Lord, "When I
awake up from both; I shall be still with thee!"</p>

<p>Is it so, blessed Jesus, that if I go to the Father in thy precious
name; my petitions shall be certainly heard, and answered? Lo, then, I
come. I feel my faith and confidence emboldened in this gracious
assurance. And as thou knowest, Lord, this day, what is most suited for
me, let thy wisdom choose, and let thy love bestow, that very grace and
mercy, be it what it may. And let a throne of grace witness for me, that
I seek it wholly on Christ's account. I consider it as good as given,
from the high love my God and Father bears towards his dear Son, as my
Surety and Saviour. And although in the moment that I ask with this
boldness of faith, I see and knoll—in myself, that I have nothing to
recommend me to thy favour, as in the least meriting that favour, but
much, very much, to make me an object in meriting thy displeasure; yet
looking up in Jesus, depending upon his blood and righteousness, and
wholly asking in his name, and for his righteousness sake only, I am
encouraged to hope that I shall not ask in vain. Oh then, Lord, hear for
Jesus's sake, and let my petition and prayer be answered, that the
Father may be glorified in his Son.</p>

<p>"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a Watcher,
and an Holy One came down from heaven."—Dan. iv. 13.</p>
<p>See my soul, that which terrified the impious monarch in his visions
of the night, ought to be to thee a subject of holy joy! When Jesus
proclaims " the day of vengeance which is in his heart;" he adds also,
"the year of my redeemed is come!" A day is enough for destruction; a
year, yea, an everlasting year, will not be too long to make his people
happy. But what a striking character is this of "a Watcher, and an Holy
One!" To whom but to Jesus can it possibly refer? Jesus, at the call of
God his Father, stood up from everlasting, to watch over his church, to
water it every moment; yea, to keep it night and day least any hurt it.
And who shall describe in how many ways the Lord Jesus is for ever
performing this blessed office, and hath been, and will be to all
eternity? Is he not for ever in the midst of them, to do all that is
needful for them: to protect, to comfort, to lead out, to bring home,
until he brings in and houseth them in his temple for ever? Yea, he
saith himself, "I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
plant them in this land, assuredly with my whole heart, and with my
whole soul," Jer. xxvii. 41. But Oh! ye despisers of my God! tremble at
the approach of this almighty Watcher, this Holy One coming down from
heaven! For he comes, armed with zeal and with wrath, "To take vengeance
on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ." Oh! kiss
the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
kindled but a little. "Blessed are they that put their trust in
him!"</p>

<p>"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us."—1 John
iv. 16.</p>
<p>Who hath known, and believed, in terms equal to the greatness of the
mercy itself, the love of God to the poor sinner! God's love must be an
infinite love, and consequently the display of it must be infinite also.
God, we are told, " Commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us." Had God loved and delighted in saints that
loved him, this would have been love. Had God taken the holy angels into
a nearer acquaintance with him, this would have been love. But when he
raised beggars from the dunghill, and took rebels from the prison to sit
upon his throne, and at a time when his justice would have been
magnified in their destruction; to prefer sinners, haters of God, and
despisers of his grace; to bring them into the closest and nearest
connection with him, in the person of his dear Son; and all this by such
a wonderful plan of mercy, as the incarnation and death of Jesus; who
hath ever calculated the extent of such grace? Who hath thoroughly known
or considered, or believed, in any degree proportioned to the
unspeakableness of the salvation, the love that God hath to us? Oh Lord,
add one blessing more. Cause my cold heart to grow warm in the
contemplation of it; and let it be my happiness to be daily studying the
breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of God,
which passeth knowledge, that I may be filled with all the fulness of
God.</p>

<p>Sweet thought! Blessed promise of a covenant promiser, whose name is
I AM! Indeed, the whole covenant of grace is made up of God's wills, and
his engaging for our shalls: and the whole is founded in the purposes of
God's love, and faithfulness, and immutability; secured in the blood and
righteousness of Christ; and stamped with the broad seal of heaven, by
God the Holy Ghost. Hence, therefore, the covenant runs, "I WILL be
their God, and they SHALL be my people." Hence, also, Jesus with all his
fulness is in the covenant. And hence, also, the Holy Ghost is engaged
to abide with them for ever, to lead them into all truth, and to glorify
the Lord Christ in their hearts. How is it possible for them to do
otherwise than rejoice, and boldly to say, "the Lord is my helper!" for
the fear of man is driven out by the fear of God? My soul! what saith
thine experience to this? Surely, thou wilt take up the same confident
language, and from the same cause, as the church. If the Lord hath said
it, he will confirm it: he will never leave, neither forsake the
redeemed of Jesus. So that I never shall be left hopeless, helpless,
comfortless! Precious Jesus! in thee I set up the Ebenezer afresh this
evening: thou, Lord, art my helper: "I will not fear what man shall do

<p>"Gad, a troop shall overcome him; but he shall overcome at the
last."—Gen. xlix. 19.</p>
<p>Is there nothing, my soul, in this sweet promise, that suits thy case
and circumstances? Was not Gad one of the children of Israel? And are
not all the seed of Israel interested in the promises? Was the tribe of
Gad for a time brought down, and brought under, by a troop of foes? And
are not all the seed of Israel oppressed and brought into subjection?
Was not that glorious Israelite, the great Captain of our salvation,
made perfect through suffering? Think, my soul, what troops of hell
assaulted him. But was the issue of the battle with him doubtful?
Neither is it now. In his blood and righteousness all the seed of Israel
shall be justified and overcome by the blood of the Lamb. What then,
though there be troops of lusts within, and legions of foes without?
Troops from earth, and troops from hell, may, and will, assault thee;
but look unto Jesus. It is said of his people of old, that they had an
eye unto him, and were enlightened, and their faces were not ashamed. So
now, Jesus undertakes for thee, and for thy faith, He saith, I will be
an enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thine adversaries. God the
Father is looking on: angels are beholding; all heaven is interested.
Nay, hadst thou but eyes to see, thou wouldest behold, like the
prophet's servant, mountains around, thee, full of horses and chariots
of fire, all engaged for thy defence. Shout, then, for the battle is
already obtained by Jesus for all his people. Though a troop may
overcome the Gadites of the Lord, yet shall they overcome at the last.
"Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

<p>"Thus shalt thou say unto him, the Lord saith thus, behold, that
which I have built, will I break down; and that which I have planted, I
will pluck up."—Jer. xlv. 4.</p>
<p>My soul, ponder well these words; and when thou hast duly meditated,
behold and see, in the instance of the church at large, and in thine own
circumstances in particular, whether the powerful operations of the
Lord's grace be not thus frequently carried on, by seemingly opposite
means? Doth not the Lord appear to be often breaking down what his own
right hand hath built, and withering what he hath planted, when
providences appear to run counter to his promises, and the way to their
accomplishment seems impossible? Thus the gourd of Jonah was blasted
when the prophet needed most a covering: thus the poor man's child, in
the gospel, when in the view of Christ, was thrown down by the devil,
and torn more than ever he had been before; Mark ix. 26. thus the
children of Israel felt Pharaoh's oppression the more called forth,
because "the Lord had promised them deliverance;" Exod. v. 22, 23. Look
at home, my soul, and see how matters are there. Since the Lord called
thee by his grace, to reveal his Son in thee, hadst thou conferred with
flesh and blood, how often to thy view would it have appeared, that
things were worse with thee than before? Surely thy corruptions never
strove for the mastery with equal strength, as since grace put a
restraint upon them: like the swelling waters, which become more violent
in proportion as the bank is thrown up to keep them back. Never did
Satan so rage in his temptations, as since Jesus blessed thee with the
visits of his love. And how often, when the enemies of thy salvation
have for a season seemed to prevail, hath it appeared to thy view, as if
the Lord had broken down that which he had built, and plucked up that
which he had planted? And how often, in the distress of soul occasioned
by it, hast thou cried out, "Hath the Lord forgotten to be gracious: and
will he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure?" Precious Jesus! how
infinitely precious, in these instances, as in every other, is the view
of thee, and of the ways of thy grace! I see, Lord, by this process of
thine, that both building and planting, both beginning and ending, are
of the Lord. That sweet scripture is confirmed: "The hands of Zerubbabel
have laid the foundation of this house: his hands shall also finish it,"
Zech. iv. 9. In thee, and upon thee, O Lord, is all founded. It is
Jehovah hath said it, and Jehovah will confirm it: "I have said, (saith
the Lord) mercy shall be built up for ever!" Ps. lxxxix. 2.</p>

<p>"For he said, surely they are my people, children that will not lie:
so he was their Saviour."—Isa. lxiii. 8.</p>
<p>Oh what a tenderness of expression is contained in these words! Jesus
not only takes his people into relationship with him, but undertakes for
their faithfulness. In the birth of God's everlasting purpose, this was
done from everlasting; so that in one and the same moment, we are his
people, his children, his brethren, his wife, his redeemed, his fair
one, made comely in his comeliness, and in his blood cleansed, and in
his righteousness justified before God. And observe, my soul, the
grounds of this relationship: surely, he saith, they are my people. Not
only as God's workmanship and property, but as his purchase. Not only in
first giving them being, but in giving them new being in Christ Jesus.
The Lord hath taken them into covenant with him in Christ, and granted
them a charter of grace and salvation in Jesus. Sweet and precious
thought. God the Father, whose right they are by creation, hath given
them to his Son. And Jesus hath made them his, both by his own purchase,
and the conquests of his grace therefore he hath an interest in them,
and in all that concerns them. Surely, saith Jesus, they are my people,
my jewels, my treasure, my hidden one. And observe further, how he
speaks for them as well as of them they will not lie. How is this? Why,
they are children of the covenant. And because he hath undertaken for
them, therefore he was their Saviour. Oh the preciousness of such a
Saviour, to every circumstance, to every state, in every way, and upon
every occasion in life, in death, in time, and to all eternity. Jesus,
thou art indeed a Saviour, thou art truly called Jesus, for thou hast
saved, and thou wilt save, thy people from their sins.</p>

9—Evening—Romans 14:23</h3>
<p>"For whatsoever is not of faith, is sin."—Rom. xiv. 23.</p>
<p>My soul, thou last long known, and I hope in a great measure felt,
the vast importance of that blessed principle, faith, without the
possession of which, "it is impossible to please God." But last thou
also considered what the Holy Ghost here saith, by the apostle, that
"whatsoever is not of faith, is sin? Pause over the expression:
"whatsoever is not of faith, is sin!" Why then it will follow, that
whatever is undertaken without an eye to God in Christ, and for God's
glory in Christ, is sin. All the acts of creatures, as sinful creatures,
must partake of sin. It is by faith in Christ, that the iniquity of our
most holy things is taken away. Hence, love to our neighbour, is no
love, unless it be a stream from the love of God: for what doth not
begin in God, will never end in God. Such views of faith are striking;
and this portion of God's word certainly opens to them, and the reason
is obvious: it is by faith only that we hear what God saith, or regard
what God appoints. We never can glorify God, till we hear and believe in
God. All God's promises are in Christ: but without faith in Christ,
there can be no belief in the promises of God in Christ. My soul, this
is a striking view of faith, and serves to shew its vast and infinite
importance. If all I undertake, all I say, all I do, the whole, without
an eye to God in Christ, partake of sin; it is high time to see that I
make Jesus the bottom, the cementing principle, and the top-stone of the
whole building. And as "whatsoever is not of faith, is sin," so the
humble offerings in faith, humble and poor as they are in themselves, if
offered in and through Jesus, come up with acceptance upon that altar
which sancifieth both gift and giver. Hence saving faith gives glory to
God, because it brings nothing, it offers nothing, but seeks all from
God in Christ, and desires that God in all things may be glorified in
Christ. Oh! for the continual outpourings of the blessed Spirit, to be
strong in this grace which is in Christ Jesus. "Lord! increase our
faith!"</p>

<p>"But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers
and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant
ships pass thereby."—Isa. xxxiii. 21.</p>
<p>See, my soul, how thy God condescends to represent himself to thee as
thy God, under various similitudes, so as to strengthen thy faith and
thy confidence in him. He that is thy gracious Lord, is also thy
glorious Lord; for he is both a sun and a shield; and he that gives
grace, will give glory; one is the earnest of the other. Well, then,
this glorious Lord will be there. Where? Why in Jesus, in thy Jesus, God
in covenant with him. "He will be unto thee a place of broad rivers and
streams." What is that? Why as Jerusalem had no navigable rivers, or
seas, to defend her from the approach of enemies all around; so God's
people are unprotected by nature, or by art, and lie open to their foes.
But what they want in nature; shall be abundantly made up to them in
grace. And as they have no art nor contrivance in themselves, God's
wisdom and love will provide true counsel for them. Since they have no
sea for their frontier, God in covenant love will himself be their sea,
their ocean, their bulwark. And what galley or ship shall pass God to
attack his people? Surely none can. And observe, my soul, as God himself
will be rivers, and broad rivers too, to defend, so will he be streams
to provide, and full streams to provide plentifully all possible
blessings. Hallelujah. Shout, my soul, as the church of old, and say, "A
fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon,
is my Beloved."</p>

10—Evening—Isaiah 40:10</h3>
<p>"Behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him."—Isa. xl.
10.</p>
<p>The whole scope of prophecy, as referring to the person and offices
of Christ, was comprised in the two great branches of "the sufferings of
Christ, and the glory that should follow." From everlasting, the work of
Jesus was before him. To his infinite and comprehensive mind, all that
he had to do and to suffer for his church, was always in his view. He
saw his church in all the glory and beauty that, in his comeliness, he
would one day put upon her; he saw this before creation took place, when
"his delights were with the sons of men;" and he saw his church also, in
all the depths of guilt and pollution, into which, by apostacy, she
would fall, and from whence he undertook to redeem her with his blood.
Hence, "for the joy that was set before him," it is said, "he endured
the cross, and despised the shame;" and having, as well by his active as
his passive obedience, both by doing and dying, finished the work in the
fulness of time, which the Father gave him to do, Jesus entered upon his
reward. But who shall describe it, or what heart fully conceive it? Who
shall say, what is the reward of Jesus in our nature, united to the
Godhead, in beholding his Father's holy law thus magnified and honoured;
the robbery done to God's honour completely restored; the loss man had
sustained, more than repaired; and salvation bestowed upon millions of
souls, by virtue of his blood and righteousness? Who shall describe it,
in beholding the human nature of Jesus advanced above all created
intelligence, either of angels or of powers? Who shall speak of the
reward of Jesus, in giving out, day by day, grace to the infinite cases
and wants of his church here below, and of glory, in all its varieties,
to the church above? Precious Jesus! let such views ever encourage my
poor soul to come to thee for all I need; since it is thy glory, and a
part of thy reward, thou dearest Lord, to give out of thy fulness, as
the blessed Head of thy church, to the wants of thy people; and thou
wilt be more glorious to my view, the more thou givest, and the more I
receive from thee. Jesus, I will say, loveth to give; may my soul
delight to receive; that while I am receiving everlasting life from
thee, the Lord Jesus may be everlastingly glorified by me, and both
Father and Son glorified in my salvation!</p>

11—Morning—Malachi 3:3</h3>
<p>"And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. And he shall
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness."—Malachi iii.
3.</p>
<p>My soul, contemplate this gracious office of thy Jesus, and then see,
whether he hath as graciously wrought it on thee. Jesus found our whole
nature, when he came to save it, wanting refining and purifying indeed.
By the operation of his holy word, and by the influences of his blessed
spirit, he brings the souls of his people into the furnace of
purification. By the fire of troubles, of afflictions, of persecutions,
he melts down their stubborn nature there. By the Spirit of judgment,
and by the Spirit of burning, he purgeth their dross, taketh away their
tin, and forms all his people into vessels of mercy and sanctification;
that he may at length present them unto himself, a glorious church, not
having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that they may be without
blame before him in love. And what endears him to his people under this
blessed character as their Refiner is this, that all the while the
process is going on, Jesus sits by, watches over them, tempers the fire
in exact proportion to what it should be, and suffers not the enemy to
fan it a jot more than his love and wisdom see it fit to be. Is this the
case, my soul, with thee? Are all the fiery trials thou hast gone
through, regulated, kept under, and blessed, by thy Jesus, to so much
good? Oh my foolish heart, how have I repined in my affliction, because
I saw not Jesus's hand in the appointment, nor discerned his love
carrying me through it. Blessed Refiner, henceforth give the to see
thee. And do thou sit in this most needful office over my soul, that as
all true believers are of the royal priesthood, being sons of Levi, and
made kings and priests to God and the Father, never may my soul come out
of the furnace of thy purification, until that I am enabled, by thy
grace, to offer to the Lord an offering in the blood and righteousness
of Jesus, whereby alone I can find acceptance with God in grace here,
and glory hereafter.</p>

<p>"If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren, within any
of thy gates, in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt
not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother; but
thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him
sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth."—Deut. xv. 7, 8.</p>
<p>How is it possible, dearest Lord Jesus, that I can read this
scripture, and call to mind thy obedience for me, in fulfilling the
whole law, without connecting with it all the blessedness of looking up
to thee under every circumstance, and in every case, for thy favour and
thy love? When Jesus became circumcised for his people, he made himself
a debtor to the whole law. And is not this delightful precept of my
evening meditation a part of it? Surely, Lord, this precept speaks to
thee. Not that my glorious Surety needed a command to the love of any of
his poor brethren; for, blessed Jesus, thy love brought thee down from
heaven, and it was thine own free voluntary love that, at the call of
God thy Father, prompted thine infinite mind to stand up as thy
brethren's law-fulfiller from all eternity. But though thou needest not.
to be put in mind of mercy to any poor brother of thine, yet is it
precious to my soul to see that this command of God my Father forms a
part in the obedience of Jesus to the whole law; and doubly blessed is
it to my soul to see, that in all the blessings wherewith Jesus, the
Head of his body the church, blesseth his people, the hand of God my
Father is in it. How hath God the Father manifested his love to his
church in the gift of his dear son, and in all those blessed commands
given to Jesus for the church's welfare! And how hath Jesus manifested
his love in giving himself, yea, and becoming sin and a curse for his
church, that all his redeemed might be made the righteousness of God in
him.! Look up then, my soul, to thy Jesus, thy Brother, thy
Law-fulfiller! He will not overlook, nor forget this sweet precept. Thou
art waxen poor indeed, but Jesus knoweth all thy poverty and all thy
need; and though thou hast been a transgressor from the womb, and hast
forgotten, times without number, thy relationship, Jesus will never
forget his. He hath so loved thee as to die for thee; so loved thee as
to shed his blood for thee; so loved thee as to plead for thee, and is
for ever appearing in the presence of God for thee. And therefore, he
will never harden his heart against thee, nor shut up his hand, nor his
heart, nor his loving-kindness, in displeasure. Precious Lord! thou art
indeed a brother born for adversity, and one that loveth at all times;
yea, "thou stickest closer than a brother."</p>

<p>Precious Lord, such was thine unbounded love to thy people that thou
gavest all to them! And, dearest Jesus, what didst thou reserve for
thyself? And how wisely was thy love manifested! To every one grace
according to the measure of the gift of Christ; for the purchase of
redemption, in the case of all, cost thee the same. If, indeed, a lamb
of thine be weak, or diseased, or torn, or scattered, thou wilt take it
to thy bosom, while thou wilt gently lead those that are with young. But
every one, and all, shall have thy care; all, as their several wants may
be. Here then, Lord, to thy table I would come. Thy death hath confirmed
all thy purchased blessings. And in the holy supper I would seek grace,
that my right may be confirmed in them. Before God, and angels, and men,
I would take the seal of thy gift. In thy blood thou hast signed them:
in the word of thy gospel thou hast recorded them: in the ordinances of
thy church they are published and brought forth: and by thy Spirit thou
givest the tokens and the pledges of them to thy redeemed. Witness for
me, then, ye angels of light, that I accept of all in Jesus and in his
free gift, the purchase of his blood, and the tokens of his love.
Sweeter are they to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb. Blessed
Jesus, thy love is better than wine.</p>

12—Evening—Isaiah 52:3</h3>
<p>"For thus saith the Lord, ye have sold yourselves for nought: and ye
shall be redeemed without money."—Isaiah lii. 3.</p>
<p>Sweet thought, arising from this gracious promise of a most gracious
covenant God in Christ! It is indeed for nought that every poor sinner
hath sold himself, and mortgaged his inheritance; for sin produceth no
wages but death, and Satan gives nothing but misery to his captives. The
world holds out great promises indeed, but never fulfils them. Vanity
and vexation of spirit are all that we receive in the close of the
account. So that what Jehovah saith, every man finds to be true; we have
sold ourselves for nought. But, blessed Lord! when at any time, for our
sin and rebellion, thou sufferest our enemies to lead us captive, what
profit doth our Lord gain by it? May we not say, in the language of the
church, "Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
wealth by thy price?" Psalm xliv. 12. If, Lord, it would be to thy
glory, that our shame, and the triumph of our enemies ministered to thy
praise, it would be enough to make thy church say, "Let us suffer, so
Jesus be but glorified." But, Lord, this is so far froth being the case,
that when Jesus's members suffer, the glorious Head is injured, and the
triumph of the foe becomes an insult to our God. How very blessed is it
then to know, that though we are soul destroyers by ministering to our
own ruin, Jesus is our soul restorer by redeeming us without money. Oh!
for grace to keep in view the vast, the immense price Jesus hath given
for our redemption! Oh! for grace to give him all the glory of our
recovery, who alone hath accomplished it! And, Lord! I would pray, that
as "the redemption of the soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever," my
soul may everlastingly rejoice in the assurance, that being bought with
such a price, not of silver and gold, but by thy blood, I may henceforth
glorify God in my body and in my spirit, which are his! Remember, my
soul, it is the Lord that saith this: "Ye have sold yourselves for
nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money!"</p>

<p>"The tree of life."—Rev. xxii. 2.</p>
<p>Lead me, O Holy Ghost, by the hand of faith, this morning, into the
paradise of God, and cause me to sit down under the tree of life; and
for a while, before the world breaks in upon me, enable me to meditate
on its beauties, its loveliness, and its fruit. Is it not Jesus which I
behold in this charming similitude? Surely Jesus is to me the tree of
life, for I have no life but in him! And it is not only he which gave me
life at the first, but preserves it, maintains it, and will preserve it
for ever. He saith himself, "Because I live, ye shall live also." And as
he is himself the life of my soul, so every thing in him is the promoter
of my life. His fruit also is all my sustenance, all I want, all I
desire, all I can truly enjoy. .He bears twelve manner of fruits. Yes,
for there is in him both fulness and variety: pardon, mercy, and peace,
in the blood of his cross; favour with God, affection with men; the
Spirit's gifts, graces, influences; comfort in this life, happiness and
joy in that which is to come. And every month these fruits abound. Yes,
he saith himself, "fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold: and
my revenue than choice silver." "I will cause them that love me to
inherit substance; yea, I will fill all their treasures." Nay, the very
leaves of this tree of life are for the healing of the nations. And how
healing indeed is Jesus, in his word, his ordinances, his providences,
his promises, his dispensations! Neither is this all: the tree of life
grows in the midst of the street, and is open in every gospel ordinance;
both to Jews and Gentiles, both to bond and free. He is also on either
side the river. The church above, though sitting under the full
enjoyment of him, doth not keep him wholly to herself. Blessed be his
name, he is as much for the glory and happiness of his church here
below, on this side the river of death. And is this tree of life, this
Jesus, mine? Oh the vast privilege! I bless thee, Oh thou Holy Spirit,
for giving me the knowledge of him now by faith: and ere long, I hope to
sit down for ever in the paradise of God, in the unceasing enjoyment of
him, from whence I shall arise no more, but dwell under his branches for
ever.</p>

<p>When Jesus, the bridegroom of his church, first came, it was in a
moment sudden and unexpected, like the surprise at a midnight hour. And
when Jesus cometh to any of his people, it is unlooked for. Indeed, it
is always midnight in the soul of a sinner, when the cry is made! But
how blessed is the cry, when a poor lost perishing sinner is advanced to
the midnight of death, on the verge of an approaching eternity, and in
that season hears the voice of the Son of God, and lives! How many, like
the thief on the cross, or like the jailor at Philippi, have been
surprised into grace at such seasons, by the sovereignty of Him, "who
calleth things that are not, as though they were?" Precious Jesus! in
all the circumstances of life, in the midnight of nature, the midnight
of carnal security, the midnight of sleep, in which even thy dear
children are so liable to be found; Oh! that we may hear thy voice, and
go forth to meet thee! And, Lord! let the going forth of thy redeemed
be, not with the lamp of a profession, but with the enlightened oil of
grace, that we may meet thee with all our affections alive, to hail and
welcome thy coming; so that "at midnight, or cock-crowing, or in the

<p>"Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make
his mighty power to be known."—Psalm cvi. 8.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, over this verse, and observe how thy gracious God
took occasion, from the misery of Israel, and even from their
unworthiness, to magnify the riches of his grace. Israel had highly
sinned: they had provoked the Lord; and their provocations were
aggravated, from the spot where they were committed, for it was at the
sea, even at the Red Sea, that memorable sea where the Lord had made a
path for their deliverance. And wherefore, then, did he save them?
Wherefore did not the Lord drown them in the depths of the sea, for
their unbelief and hardness of heart? This sweet scripture gives the
reason. "He saved them for his name's sake." His name was engaged in
covenant promises, and his glory was magnified in making good his
engagements, notwithstanding all their undeservings. And what saith this
doctrine to thee, my soul? There is a nevertheless with thee also, from
God's covenant engagement in Christ and to Christ, thy glorious covenant
head, notwithstanding all thy unworthiness and provocations. Though I
fail in all, God's covenant fails in none. Though my unbelief breaks out
like Israel's, even at the red sea of Christ's blood; yet the efficacy
of that blood is still the same, and the Father's engagement to his dear
Son, by virtue of it, never can fail. His own love is the standard of
his grace, and not my deservings; his name's sake, and not my merit, the
rule of his favour towards his people; and all in Jesus. Fold up, then,
this blessed scripture, my soul, for thy daily meditation, and learn to
bless the freeness of that grace which hath for its object the glory of
God's name, and no motive for thy salvation, but God's glory in Christ
Jesus.</p>

blessing his people when they follow him, but he will bless them by
recovering them when they halt. And of all the tokens of grace, that is
the most endearing which is manifested over the aboundings of
transgression. We have a passage similar to this in the writings of
Isaiah, in which the Lord complains of the baseness of his people: "But
thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O
Israel. Thou hast made me to server with thy sins, and thou hast wearied
me with thine iniquities." One might suppose, after such a charge, and
such instances of ingratitude, that the next account would be, that the
Lord had given up Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches: but, no!
what saith the Lord? "I, even I, am lie that blotteth out thy
transgressions, for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins;"
Isaiah xliii. 22, &amp;c. How doubly refreshing is grace, when it comes
over all our unworthiness, rebellions, and sins! See, my soul, how the
Lord graciously overrules thine haltings, and makes a falling time to
become a rising time, to his praise, and to thy comfort! Lord! confirm
thy word unto thy servant, wherein thou hast caused me to hope! Do thou,
Lord, in this day, thine own day, the gospel day, fulfil thy promise,
and let all our haltings be healed, and "give us to run the way of thy
commandments, when thou hast set our souls at liberty."</p>

<p>Have former trials been blessed to thee, my soul? Why then depend
upon it, this, be it what it may, will be also. The covenant love and
faithfulness of God in Christ are both the same now, as they ever were.
If the Lord hath hitherto been making all things work together for good,
so will he now. Only pause and consider why it must be so. Thy God is
the same God as ever is he not? And his love to thee the same, because
it is in Jesus; his covenant the same, his promises the same; the blood
and righteousness of the Lord Jesus in efficacy the same. Well then, as
all the perfections of God are engaged for God's people, certain it is,
that no trial to his people can arise which he knew not, nay, which he
appointed not, and for which he hath not made a suitable provision. Well
then, what trouble of thine can be so great, as to counteract and
overcome divine strength? What burden so heavy that Jesus cannot bear?
What afflictions so painful that Jesus cannot soften? What grief so
scorching as to dry up the streams of God's love? Hear then his words:
"In your patience possess ye your souls." My soul, rest in this. Let
past experience bring thee present confidence. See that all the fresh
springs of patience flow from Jesus. Wait patiently for the Lord, by
believing in him; and, depend upon it, thy present tribulation, of what

figures. The feeding of the church in the wilderness with manna forty
years, was a standing miracle, and, as such, became a most suitable type
of Jesus. My soul, look at it, this evening, in this point of view, and
behold what the Spirit holds forth in it, concerning the Lord Jesus. The
continuance of this supply from heaven became a beautiful resemblance of
the state of believers in all ages. The rebellion of Israel occasioned
not any suspension of the mercy; for though they murmured and rebelled,
the manna was sent the same, "new and pure every morning." Sweet thought
to the poor timid believer! Though we fail in our duty, Jesus will not
diminish in his love.; and though we neglect him, yet will he not forget
us. Moreover, morning by morning, the blessing came; not a day, not an
hour omitted. Jesus is all this, and more: "For it shall come to pass,
that before my people call, (saith Jehovah) I will answer; and while
they are speaking, I will hear;" Isaiah lxv. 24. There is another
precious thought suggested in the view of the type, and the thing
signified; all the people partook of the rich mercy. There was enough
manna for every one; for each and for all. Such is Jesus to his people.
Every state and every circumstance he is able to supply, and he doth and
will supply; and therefore, between the old church of the old testament
believers, and the new church of new testament saints, there is a great
analogy and agreement. Christ is the sum and substance of all and every
one of the people. One thing more: As Israel had no other sustenance
until they came to the borders of Canaan, so the people of God now have
no other, yea, they desire no other, until they come to the Canaan
above. In Jesus there is a fulness of grace, and life, and glory. Hail,
thou heavenly bread! thou word of God! Be thou my portion, the bread of
life, until I am brought down to the waters of Jordan. Help me, Lord, by
faith, to feed on thee and on thy great salvation; and "may my
meditation of thee be sweet!"</p>

<p>"He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that
hateth suretyship is sure,"—Prov. xi. 15.</p>
<p>Blessed Jesus, well is it for me that thou didst not hate to become a
Surety; for hadst thou so done, and refused the vast undertaking, I must
have perished for ever. And hadst thou consented to have become a Surety
only for friends, and those only that loved thee, still here again I
should have been lost: but when thou condescendedst to become Surety for
me, Oh Lord, it was not simply for a stranger, but for a rebel, a hater
and despiser of thee, and of try great salvation. Oh the love of God
that passeth knowledge! And how, blessed Jesus, didst thou indeed smart,
and wert crushed and broken, when for my dreadful debt of sin, which
surpassed all the angels of light to pay, it pleased the Father to
bruise thee, and to put thee to grief. Oh matchless love of a most
compassionate Saviour! Me. thinks I still see thee taking my place under
the angry eye of God's broken law. Methinks I see thee striking my
worthless name out of the bond of the covenant of the law of works, and
putting thine own in. Methinks I still hear thee, like another Judah,
who in this was evidently try type, saying to God and the Father, "I
will be Surety for him: at my hands thou shalt require him." Oh Lamb of
God! I bless thee as my Surety. I acknowledge thee as my glorious
Sponsor. I was a stranger, indeed, and thou hast owned me, and brought
me home. I was in debt and insolvent, and thou hast cancelled the whole
in the blood of try cross. "I was naked, and thou hast clothed me; sick,
and in prison, and thou hast visited, healed me, and brought me out." I
was lost, and thou hast redeemed and saved me. "Oh what shall I render
unto the Lord for all the benefits he hath done unto me? Bless the Lord,
Oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name."</p>

<p>"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem."—Gen. ix. 27.</p>
<p>None but God himself could do either. Who but God could enlarge the
one, or persuade and overrule the other? Of Japheth came the Gentiles,
Gen. x. 5; and Shem is the father of Israel. But Jesus, and Jesus only,
can bring both Jew and Gentile into one fold, under one Shepherd. And
when the fulness of the Gentiles shall be completed, then shall all
Israel be saved. Then will the Deliverer arise out of Zion, to turn away
ungodliness from Jacob. My soul, art thou, night by night, and morning
by morning, besieging a throne of grace, that the Lord would hasten the
latter day of glory? Surely, if _thou feelest due concern for the
Redeemer's glory, this must form a part in try daily petition. Who
indeed can be indifferent to the interests of Christ's kingdom? "In the
multitude of the people," saith Solomon, "is the king's honour;" Prov.
xiv. 28; and in the multitude of redeemed souls, is the glory of Christ
Jesus. Lord! I would pray, fulfil this blessed promise. Enlarge Japheth,
and cause him to dwell in the tents Of Shem. Let the heathen be given to
our God and Saviour for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the
earth for his possession. "Oh! that the salvation were given unto Israel
out of Zion! Oh! that the Lord would deliver his people out of
captivity! then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad!"</p>

<p>"Fear not: I have the keys of hell and of death."—Rev. i. 17, 18.</p>
<p>Is it Jesus, all precious, all lovely, all powerful Jesus, that saith
this? He who hath redeemed my soul from hell, mine eyes from tears, and
my feet from falling? And hath Jesus, my Husband, my Brother, my
Redeemer, the keys both of hell and of death? Why then it is impossible
for any to open death's door one moment before that he gives the
appointment. And doth he command me to fear not? Oh then, my soul,
dismiss all anxiety about thy departure. Thy time is in Jesus's hands;
the keys are hanging at thy Redeemer's girdle. Never fear, neither to
die as thou hast lived, and art living, in a believing frame in Jesus.
This is as much suited to a dying time, as it is to a living time; for
with this thou mayest go out of the world, as safe as living in it. "To
live is Christ, and to die is gain." God's covenant love, and God's
covenant promises in Jesus, are the same. They are, both in death and
life, fixed and sure. When Jesus therefore comes, when the Master calls
for thee, wilt thou feel reluctant? What, reluctant to go to Jesus? Is
this thy love, thy kindness to thy friend? Forbid it, dearest Lord! No,
my precious, blessed Jesus, open the gate of death to me when thou
pleasest, where thou pleasest, and how thou pleasest. Sure I am thou
wilt be present, and that is enough for me; and when the ground of all
sensible comforts is sinking under me, Oh for a vigorous effort of faith
communicated by thee, that I may drop the body, and leap at once into
thy arms, with the last cry of faith, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,
for thou hast redeemed me, Oh Lord, thou God of truth."</p>

17—Evening—Psalm 87:7</h3>
<p>"All my springs are in thee."—Psalm lxxxvii. 7.</p>
<p>Sweet thought! And this, as Solomon saith upon another occasion,
forms the conclusion of the whole matter. Jesus is the source, the
fountain, the author, the finisher of all our mercies; for every thing
of life and salvation, of grace and glory, flow from him, centre in him;
and therefore in him and from him, as the source of blessedness, all our
springs must flow. In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily
.All glories are in him: the glory of the church above; the glory of the
church below; yea, the glory of angels and of God himself; for the
Father hath given all his glory into his almighty hands. Hence, my soul,
from whom should thy springs flow, but from Jesus? If all divine
attributes, all divine perfections are in him; if grace be no where but
in Jesus; no blessing, no redemption but in his blood; if all gifts, and
graces flow from him, and can no where else be found, to whom shall the
gathering of the people be, or from whom shall all blessings come? And
what a refreshing consideration is this, under all the barren, dry, and
withering frames of the believer's heart. See to it, my soul, that thou
art coming- to Jesus, day by day, for suitable supplies; and let not
thine emptiness discourage thee, or keep thee away, but rather let a
sense of thy poverty endear to thee Jesus's riches. Thou art as exactly
suited for him, as he is suited to thee; and as much as thou needest his
fulness, Jesus no less needs vessels to fill into, and to pour out upon,
of his blessings. Precious Lord Jesus! behold then I am come to thee; I
find, in every thing beside thee, sin, death, and misery. Oh, the
rapturous thought! "All my springs are in thee!"</p>

<p>Who would have thought that so short a verse should contain so much
sweetness? And who would have conceived that in it the gracious offices
of all the Persons of the Godhead, as they are mercifully exercised
towards a poor sinner; are described? Is not the access to a throne of
grace the work, the leading of God the Holy Ghost? Surely, he is the
Spirit here spoken of. And through whom can a poor sinner have access to
the mercy-seat but in him, and by him, and through him, whom the Father
heareth always? And of whom should the regenerated, adopted child of God
have access, but unto his God and Father in Christ Jesus? Are then all
the glorious persons of the Godhead thus revealed, as engaged in every
poor sinner's approach to the heavenly throne? Oh for grace to give to
each, and to all, the praise, and glory, and love, due to such
transcendent mercy; and in a conscious sense of being interested in this
great salvation, to cry out with the apostle: "Now thanks be unto God,
who always causeth us to triumph in Christ."</p>

18—Evening—Song of Solomon 6:9</h3>
<p>"The daughters saw her, and blessed her."—Song vi. 9.</p>
<p>These are the words of Jesus, in commendation of his church. He holds
her forth as lovely not only in his view, but in the eyes of others. The
daughters probably, mean true believers, in whose esteem Christ and his
church are most engaging; and it is more than probable that by
daughters, young believers are particularly meant, whose first love,
like the blossom of the apple-tree, is most beautiful in its first
opening. Pause, my soul, and behold, from what Jesus himself saith of
his church, how truly lovely she must be in the Redeemer's view; and
indeed without a proper apprehension of the infinite value of the human
soul, it is not possible to conceive of the exalted light wherein the
church must appear to Jesus. We may form some faint idea of its value,
from the vast price it cost Jesus in the redemption. None but the Son of
God could make the purchase; and even Jesus only by blood. Who shall say
how infinitely precious then must the church at large, composed of an
innumerable host of redeemed souls as it is, appear in Jesuss eyes? The
soul washed in his blood, and clothed in his spotless robe of
righteousness, must be lovely indeed! And in that day, when Jesus brings
the church home finally and fully, to present her to himself and Father,
a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and
when the church shall appear amidst a congregated world of men and
angels, the purchase of Jesus's blood, the gift of his Father's grace,
and the conquest of the Holy Ghost; how will the daughters who see her,
then bless her, and bless him, who is the author of all her unspeakable
glory and felicity! Precious Lord Jesus! if such be the beauty of thy
church, what must thy glory be, in whose comeliness alone she is made
lovely? Oh! for grace to view Jesus in all, and to love Jesus in all!
Thou, Lord, art the source and fountain of blessedness to thy church and
people, for grace here, and glory to all eternity.</p>

<p>"God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord."—1 Cor. i. 9.</p>
<p>Think, my soul, what a dignity believers in Jesus are called unto,
when brought into a nearness of communion with their glorious head, in
any exercise of trial or affliction for his sake. God is. faithful in
the appointment. How? In that it proves God's fulfilment of his covenant
promises, when Jesus and his members are considered by him as one. God
is faithful in manifesting this oneness and fellowship, in making the
members conformable to their glorious head, by trials or sufferings. God
is faithful in sending the affliction. And God manifests his
faithfulness in guiding through it, and supporting under it. The trial
itself, be it what it may, is a discovery of the covenant love and
faithfulness of Jehovah. Nay, God would not have manifested his
faithfulness to a believer without it. What a sweet consoling thought
this is to the afflicted exercised followers of the Lamb under their
trials! My soul, do thou look at the subject, and learn from it to
consider all tribulations in this view; and what a blessedness will pour
in upon thee from so doing. Hath the Lord called thee to exercises? Hath
the progress of them led thee more to Jesus? Hath the issue of them
tended to endear Jesus?—Oh then, proclaim God's faithfulness. I know,
Lord, said one of old under trials, "that thy judgments are right, and
that thou in very faithfulness hast afflicted me." Precious Jesus, what
a dignified path is tribulation, when we are enabled to see thy
footsteps going before marked with blood.</p>

19—Evening—Revelation 22:4</h3>
<p>"And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their
foreheads."—Rev. xxii. 4.</p>
<p>My soul, thy morning thoughts were directed to the sweet subject of
being called to fellowship with thy Lord Jesus Christ in grace. Do thou,
this evening, beg of God the Holy Ghost to enable thee to connect with
it the transporting subject of the everlasting enjoyment of Jesus in
glory This is the great end and final consummation of all. This blessed
scripture leads immediateIy to the contemplation: "They shall see his
face;" and on "their foreheads shall be his name:" that is, the token of
their oneness, union, and relationship in and with Jesus; so that he
will be their glory, their supreme happiness and joy; and thus he will
never cease to be the immediate head of all his body, the church, "the
fulness that filleth all in all;" yea, the only and everlasting medium
of communication in glory, as he is of grace in this life. Pause, my
soul, over this vast thought! when soul and body, after the long
separation by death, shall be again united, and both, as the redeemed of
the Lord, be formed one in him in glory; both then equally made capable
of enjoying Christ, and both equally disposed for that enjoyment; then
will the blessedness of seeing his face be complete. No doubt but that
at death the sight and enjoyment of Jesus will be a joy unspeakable and
full of glory; but the full, complete, and eternal enjoyment of God in
Christ must be reserved to the consummation of all things, when the Lord
hath brought home all his redeemed, and the mediatorial kingdom of Jesus
in grace here is swallowed up in glory, and God, in his threefold
character of person, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, shall be "all in all!"
Pause, again, my soul, over the vast thought! The glorious head of his
church will then have brought home every individual of his body! He will
fill all his members with glory. All their glory shall be in God in
Christ! And God in Christ will be the life, the light, the everlasting
happiness, and glory in them all. Ponder well the glorious thought! Take
it with thee to thy chamber! Drop asleep with it! And, Oh! may it be the
sweet thought in death, when thou droppest asleep in Jesus; then may
Jesus be the last of thy dying thoughts, and the first of thy
everlasting enjoyment, when, waking from the sleep of death, thou shalt
open thine eyes to the glories of eternity, "to see his face, and his
name in thy forehead!"</p>

<p>"The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sin."—1
John i. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, sit down for a while, by this crimson fountain, and duly
ponder over this glorious property of thy Redeemer's blood. Oh the
sovereign efficacy of it! For it not only cleanseth sin, but all sin:
not only other's sins, but our sins: not only the present evil of sin,
but the everlasting evil of it: not only now, but for ever. It cleanseth
from all sin. Pause, my soul. Is there any other laver to wash away sin;
can prayers, or tears, or repentance, or ordinances, or communions, or
duties, or alms? Oh no. We must say of every thing, and of all things,
out of Christ, and void of Christ, as Job did concerning his friends,
"Miserable comforters are ye all; physicians of no value." Here then, my
soul, seek thy cleansing, and here only. And while to this fountain thou
art daily brought by the Holy Ghost, look up and behold the whole
assembly of the redeemed above, who are now standing around the throne,
owing their bliss and their cleansing to the same source. Listen to
their songs of joy, and catch the notes, to sing even now the same song
of rejoicing. "They have washed their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb." And therefore it is, and for no other cause, that
they are now before the throne, and serve the Lord in his temple day and
night.</p>

20—Evening—1 Thessalonians 4:14</h3>
<p>"Them also which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him."—1 Thess.
iv. 14.</p>
<p>My soul, thy last night's thoughts, with which thou fell asleep, were
upon a subject so truly connected with Jesus, that I hope thou couldest
and didst say, "My meditation of him was sweet!" There is another
blessed thought, connected both with Jesus and it, that may be, proper
to take along with it. Seek of God the Spirit to unfold its beauties in
Jesus to thy view, this evening, and lead thee with it to fall asleep,
this night, as on the former, in the Lord. The apostle opens it to thy
meditation in these words; "They which sleep in Jesus, God will bring
with him." The bodies, as well as the souls of the redeemed, are alike
the purchase of Christ's blood, and Jesus will have them all with him.
They are his jewels, his treasure, his segullah. He suffers them to lie
among the dust, it is true; but he saith himself, though they have so
lain, yet shall they be "as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and
her feathers with yellow gold," Ps. lxviii. 13. How will Jesus
accomplish this at the last day? He explains it himself; "And I, if I be
lifted up, will draw all unto me;" John xii. 32. And if the magnetic
powers of the loadstone be such that it will separate the smallest
particles of steel from every thing of earth or dust around, so that
they shall fly to the touch of the loadstone in every direction; can his
powers be doubted, who Hath constituted such principles in nature so to
act and so to be governed? Oh, my soul, how sure is it, that Jesus will
at the last day open the graves of his people, and cause them to come up
out of them! Heaven would not be complete without this; neither the Lord
Jesus fully rewarded, to see "the travail of his soul." This final
consummation of all things, is the blessedness Paul speaks of, when, "in
the dispensation of the fulness of time, Jehovah might gather together
in one, all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on
earth, even in him," Eph. i. 10. Sweet thought; my soul, take it with
thee to thy bed. This glory, this triumph of thy Jesus, as Mediator, the
head of his body the church, remains to be accomplished; neither will it
be accomplished until "the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed!" The patriarchs, the
prophets, and holy saints of God, who died in Christ, before his
incarnation, felt, no doubt, an accession to their glory and happiness,
and joy in their souls, when the Son of God, after he had finished
redemption-work, returned to heaven. The sight they had of Christ in his
human nature opened a new source of joy unspeakable. Oh, the unknown
rapture of feasting their eyes upon him. And "the spirits of just men
made perfect (some of whom, my soul, thou hast seen, and known, and
enjoyed sweet communion with in the church below) who are now before the
throne, and serve him in his temple night and day: "they are at the
fountainhead of bliss, in "seeing Jesus as he is, and knowing, even as
they are known." Nevertheless, their present enjoyments are the
enjoyments of the soul only; their felicity is not complete, until, at
the restitution of all things, their bodies shall be raised to the
triumphs of eternity. Take, my soul, these thoughts with thee to bed;
and be as ready to give thy body to thy Jesus for the grave, that he, in
his own time, which is the best time, may undress thee for it, as thou
takest off thy garments for nightly rest; for most certain it is, that
as "Jesus died and rose again, even them also which sleep in Jesus, will
God bring with him."</p>

21—Morning—Psalm 69:4</h3>
<p>"Then I restored that which I took not away."—Psalm lxix. 4.</p>
<p>Whose words are these? They can be none but the words of Jesus; for
none ever made restoration but he; and none but he could say, I took
nothing away. And what was taken away? God's glory was taken away by
sin; and consequently, man's happiness also. For when Adam sinned, he
robbed God of his glory, and robbed himself and all his posterity of
God's image, and with it all happiness. Nay, my soul, thou hast done the
same, in every renewed act of disobedience. And in breaking the divine
law thou hast justly lost the divine favour. And hath Jesus, all
precious Jesus, restored all these? Yes, blessings on his name, he hath!
And what renders it ten-fold more gracious, he hath so done it as never
to be lost any more. By his finished work of salvation he hath restored
to God his glory. And by his obedience and death, as our Surety, he hath
restored to man his happiness. The favour of God we lost by sin; Jesus
hath restored it, by justifying us in his righteousness. The image of
God we lost by rebellion; Jesus hath restored to us this image, in
sanctifying us by his holiness. So that every way, and in all things,
Jesus hath made up the breach; and the poor sinner who is led by grace
to believe in Jesus, stands more complete and secure now; than before
the fall. For if Adam had never sinned, nor his children in him, yet,
after all, their righteousness before God would have been but the
righteousness of creatures. Whereas now, in Jesus, the believer stands
accepted and secured in the righteousness of the Creator. Hail, then,
thou Almighty Restorer of our fallen nature! In thee, Lord, would my
poor soul triumphantly say, "have I righteousness and strength; even to
thee shall men come; and all that believe in thee shall never be ashamed
nor confounded, world without end."</p>

<p>"Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"—1 Cor. ix.
7.</p>
<p>Surely Jesus will not! Is not Jesus's church his vineyard? Did he not
purchase it with his blood; and does he not water it every moment with
the same? And will he not eat of the fruit of his own vine, of his own
planting, and what cost him so dear? Or doth Jesus buy a flock; daily,
hourly, feed his flock; carry the lambs in his arms, and cause them to
lie down in his bosom; and will he not eat of the milk of his flock?
Lord Jesus, when I contemplate thy love to our poor nature; when I
behold all things, by thine ordination, ministering to our nature; when
I see such a profusion of grace, and love, and mercy bestowed for our
accommodation; all things prepared for man; both worlds engaged for him;
yea, man himself as if a world in himself, and another prepared for him;
the sacred word designed wholly for him; angels, ministering spirits
sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation; God, his Father;
Jesus, his Brother, Surety, Redeemer; the Holy Ghost, his Comforter!
When I look around, above, below, in every way, and in every direction,
and behold man like some palace, built by thee, O Lord, the great
architect! surely; I cry out, Jesus would never have prepared such a
temple but for his own glory! O come then, Lord; come and inhabit what
is thine own! Having created it, and by a new creation made it again
thine; bought it, washed it with thy blood, and prepared it by thy
Spirit; Oh come, and dwell in it, and take the full, the entire, the
everlasting possession of it. Lord, whoever planted a vineyard, and did
not eat of the fruit thereof? Who ever fed a flock, and did not eat of
the milk of the flock? Surely not Jesus!</p>

<p>"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his
good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself."—Eph. i. 9.</p>
<p>My soul, pause over these volumes of divine truth for they are not as
so many simple words, but contain vast volumes indeed, and such as a
whole eternity will not afford space to read over and finish. The first
is a large one indeed—even the mystery of God's will namely, the mystery
of redemption, originating in the divine mind, before all worlds. And
this is not the smallest part of it, that it should be made known in any
degree or measure to thee, my soul, a poor creature of a day, and that
day, a day of nothing but sin. The second volume in this vast subject is
another precious part of the same glorious truth; namely, that this
mercy of God in Christ is the sole result of God's good pleasure. No
foresight, no merit, no pretensions of thine, my soul; no, nor the
merits of arch-angels, becoming in the least the cause. For though a
gracious God hath taken occasion to make a glorious display of the
depths of his grace, from the depths of man's ruin; yet it was not our
state, but his good pleasure, which laid the foundation of our recovery
by Jesus Christ. And the third volume in this stupendous subject is,
that he that planned, executed and finished it. As none but infinite
wisdom could purpose, so none but infinite power could accomplish.
Pause, my soul, and contemplate the vast mercy! It comes from God in
Christ, as the first cause; and reverts back again to God in Christ, as
the final end. Hallelujah.</p>

soul; "life in Christ Jesus," and "the promise of life in Christ Jesus."
What wouldest thou have more? Nay, what canst thou have more? Life, with
all its eventful consequences; grace here, and glory to all eternity, in
Christ, as thine head, everlastingly secured by God the Father's promise
in Christ. So that as God the Father is the almighty promiser, and
Christ comprehensively so in himself, and all his fulness the promise;
so the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of promise, in all his manifold
influences, confirms and seals the same to the heart of all true
believers, in a life of grace, leading to a life of glory. Say, my soul,

Jesus, when I consider the many precious instances of thy coming, set up
from everlasting in thy goings forth for the salvation of thy chosen,
thy anticipation, in thy visits before the season of thy tabernacling in
our flesh; thy visits to the patriarchs and prophets; thy manifestation
openly to the people; thy secret, sweet, and inexpressibly gracious
visits now, and thy promised return in the clouds at the final
consummation of all things; Oh Lamb of God, dost thou say, "Lo, I come?"
Oh for the earnestness of faith, in all her devout longings, to cry out
with the church of old, and say, "Make haste, my Beloved, and come! Oh
come quickly, Lord Jesus!"</p>

23—Evening—Luke 1:78</h3>
<p>"The day-spring from on high."—Luke i. 78.</p>
<p>Truly it was so when Jesus came; for a long night of Jewish darkness
and ignorance had covered the earth, and gross darkness the people.
Look, my soul, at Jesus under this blessed similitude. Though it be
evening with' thee, this day-spring will give light, and the promise
will be fulfilled, "at even-time it shall be light." Jesus was the
day-spring in the everlasting council and purpose of Jehovah, when he
stood up the light of his people from all eternity. And when, in the
fulness of time, he came, it was to fulfil all the shadows of ordinances
concerning him. And what is it now, in every individual instance of his
visiting his people, but as "the day-spring" on their souls? When first,
from a state of nature, he calls them to a state of grace, is it not
"the day-spring from on high?" And in all the after-stages, during a
life of grace leading, to glory, is not every renewed manifestation of
his love as the day-spring from on high?" And what will it be after the
night of death, when Jesus shall come "to be glorified in his saints,
and admired in all that believe," but the same? Jesus will then be "the
day-spring," and "the morning-star" of that everlasting day, whose sun
shall go down no more. Precious day-spring of my God! arise daily on my
poor soul, and fill my heart with light and glory.</p>

24—Morning—Galatians 4:4</h3>
<p>"God sent forth his Son, made of a woman."—Gal. iv. 4.</p>
<p>How little did Adam suppose, when he charged God foolishly, as by the
way it may be observed all sinners do by this plan, in attempting to
palm off his sin upon God, that the Lord in after ages would put
distinguishing honour upon the woman, in which the man should bear no
part. "The woman," said Adam, "whom thou gavest to be with me, she
tempted me, and I did eat." Thus endeavouring to throw the whole blame
of his transgression upon his gracious Benefactor. It is as if he had
said, hadst thou not given me this woman, I should not have disobeyed
thy command. Now observe, my soul, God's benignity and grace upon this
occasion. "The seed of the woman," said God, "shall bruise the serpent's
head." Not the seed of the man, but of the woman. And when the fulness
of the time was come for this promise to be accomplished, "God sent
forth his Son made of a woman," without the intervention of an human
father, but by the miraculous impregnation only of the Holy Ghost, as if
to honour the weaker vessel, and to open a source of peculiar comfort in
the female breast. As if God had said, in answer to Adam's daring
impiety, though all the redeemed among men shall partake in this great
salvation, yet the woman shall have in it an eminent token of divine
favour. And as the accursed enemy of God and man did first beguile the
woman; from the woman shall arise him that shall destroy the devil. The
blessings of redemption shall begin with the woman, to her peculiar
honour, and to the serpent's everlasting shame. For he that in after
ages shall do away more than all the evil of sin and the fall, by the
sacrifice of himself, shall be born of a woman. And thus the Lord
manifested forth his grace in silencing Adam's unbecoming expostulation.
Oh the wonderful way and method of our wonder-working God!</p>

24—Evening—Luke 2:8</h3>
<p>"Shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by
night."—Luke ii. 8.</p>
<p>My soul, think what a memorable night was that, which ushered in the
wondrous day, the most momentous ever marked in the annals of time,
since reckoning of days or years was made. The unconscious shepherds in
the fields had no other thought but of their flock. But what a morning
did the angels call them to celebrate! Now, my, soul, sit down and take
a leisurely survey, of the wonderful story of Jesus's birth. Mark the
several volumes in it; for a night, yea, for a whole eternity must end
before the subject of God incarnate can be exhausted in the meditation.
Let thy evening thoughts on this, be followed by the night
contemplation; and let thy midnight only be broken in upon, by the same
call that the heavenly host gave to the shepherds. Arise but to sing as
they sang, and to go in quest of Jesus, as they went. God and mall in
one person, one Christ; and God in Christ coming for the purposes of
salvation, will furnish out an hymn, which, though begun in life, will
never end in eternity; "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will towards men!"</p>

<p>"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."—John i. 14.</p>
<p>Turn aside, my soul, this day, from every vain and worldly thought,
as Moses did at the bush, and behold by faith the accomplishment of what
he then saw in type and figure, of this great sight which the Lord hath
made known unto thee. The Word, the uncreated Word, even the eternal Son
of God, taking upon him the nature of man, and uniting both in one
Person, that by the union he might be a suitable Saviour for his people.
As God, he was mighty to save, and fully competent to the wonderful act.
As man; he was a suitable Saviour, for the right of redemption belonged
to him. And as both, he, and he alone, could become a proper Mediator,
to reconcile and bring together God and man, which by sin were at
variance. This was the glorious news angels posted down from heaven to
proclaim. This was the song of heaven, for which they sung "glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to men." My soul, canst
thou join in the song? Yes, if so be thou hast received Christ in those
glorious characters; if, as for this divine purpose he was born in our
streets, he is born in thy heart also, and formed there the hope of
glory. Oh it is a blessed thing to have true scriptural views of the
Lord Jesus, and so to receive him, as Jehovah hath sent him forth, the
Christ of God. Amen.</p>

25—Evening—1 Timothy 3:16</h3>
<p>"And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached
unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."—1
Tim. iii. 16.</p>
<p>My soul, sit down this memorable evening, and in commemorating the
great event of Christ's nativity, listen to what the Holy Ghost here
speaks, by his servant the apostle, concerning the mystery of godliness!
Here are so many wonders branched out into so many chapters: they hang
like a rich and full cluster upon the vine. Gather them one by one, mark
their beauties, and taste their sweetness. The first is, "God manifest
in the flesh:' here is a meditation for thee to live upon, and to feast
upon for ever. Thy God, thy Jesus, thy Holy One, the Son of God, was
made flesh! Go on to the second: He was "justified in the Spirit:" a
matter that would never have taken place, had he not fully, by his
righteousness. and death, satisfied his Father's law, and brought in an
everlasting righteousness for his people. Take down the third blessed
character: He was "seen of angels." Yes! they worshipped him also: for
angels, principalities, and powers, were made subject unto him. Look, my
soul, at thy Lord, under the fourth description which the Holy Ghost
hath here given of him: He was "preached unto the Gentiles:" and this
was as great a mystery to the Jewish church, as any; that God should"
grant to the Gentiles also, through Christ, repentance unto life." And
how dear this part of Jesus's character should be to thee, my soul, who
wast by nature a poor Gentile, an alien to the commonwealth of Israel,
having no hope, and without God in the world, thou needest not to be
told. Mark another, and the fifth, particularity of thy Jesus; he is
said to be "believed on in the world:" and how should this have been
done, even in a single instance, but for the sovereignty of God's grace?
Surely this is no less a mystery also. Remark, my soul, how great, how
very great in thy case. Lastly, the account closeth: "Jesus was received
up into glory:" and there, my soul, do thou, follow him, by faith, until
the Lord come to take thee home with him in absolute enjoyment, that
"where he is, there thou mayest be also." Amen.</p>

26—Morning—2 Timothy 2:8</h3>
<p>"Jesus Christ of the seed of David."—2 Tim. ii. 8.</p>
<p>Sweet thought! Jesus will have regard to both sexes in his
incarnation. He will be of the seed of the woman. He will be also truly
and properly man. As both the man and woman had sinned, so redemption
shall be for both. But in the holy nature, in which as Redeemer he will
come, he will partake of none of their sins. The man shall have no hand
in his generation. And the womb of the woman shall be but the deposit of
that holy thing so called, (Luke i. 35.) by the miraculous conception of
the Holy Ghost. So that the body which God the Father prepared him,
belonged to both, but was unconnected with either. He must be truly man;
for the law had said, "Every male that openeth the womb shall be called
holy unto the Lord." He must be a priest; and no woman could minister in
that office. He must be a prophet; and no woman could exercise that
province, for it is not permitted for a woman to speak in the church. He
must be a king; and the kingly office belongeth not to the weaker
vessel. But both sexes shall be equally at the same time concerned in
the blessed event of his incarnation. The woman is saved in the
child-bearing of this Redeemer, and the man brought into favour and
reconciliation; "for as by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead." So that, as the apostle strongly and
satisfactorily concludes, "there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, but ye are all
one in Christ Jesus."</p>

26—Evening—1 Peter 2:8</h3>
<p>"A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence."—1 Peter ii. 8.</p>
<p>O my Lord! how wonderful is it, that thy coming should have given
such offence to thy people? The prophet, indeed, said it should be so,
and thereby gave one among the many testimonies to thy character. "He,"
saith the prophet (Isaiah viii. 14.) "that shall be for a sanctuary,
shall be but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both
the houses of Israel." But what was there, my Lord, in thee, and the
gracious purpose for which thou came, that could have furnished occasion
for stumbling? Thy birth, indeed, was humble, thy life marked with
sorrow, thy death ignominious, and every thing about thee debased. But
under all these things, did not the Godhead burst forth in acts which
none but God could perform? And is the offence of the cross ceased in
the present hour? Alas! what multitudes of sinners now, as much as then,
still live to despise salvation by thy blood and righteousness? Precious
Jesus! who made me to differ from another? Why was I constrained to look
unto thee as the Rock of Ages, the precious stone that Jehovah hath laid
in Zion for salvation, while thousands refuse that thou shouldest reign
over them? Oh! for grace to praise thee, and to love thee! Now, Lord, do
I discover a preciousness in that divine scripture, and thank thee for
it as my own; "Blessed is he (thou hast said) whosoever is not offended
in thee!"</p>
<h3 class="s7"><span
id="chapter-4_split_008.xhtml#chapter-4-sh721"></span>December
27—Morning—Isaiah 54:10</h3>
<p>"For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed: but my
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my
peace be removed, saith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee."—Isaiah liv.
10.</p>
<p>What a rest is here for a poor redeemed sinner to stand firm upon, in
time, and to all eternity! Well may lie cry out concerning Jesus, and
his great salvation in him, "He is a rock, and his work is perfect."
Yes, yes, thou Lord God of my salvation: thou art my dwelling-place in
all generations. My soul, look all around thee, look within thee, look
every where about thee. Search, behold, examine diligently, what else
will or can afford thee any security. And think what a dying world it is
in which thou art dwelling, or rather travelling through. What friend,
what brother, what child, what relation, can give thee help of soul, or
even of body, when thou most shalt need it? Think what a day, a week, an
hour, may bring forth! Amidst all these changes, is Jesus thine? Doth he
tell thee, "that though mountains depart, and hills be removed, his
salvation and the Father's covenant of peace is the same?" Shout, shout,
my soul, and begin the song, which in a dying hour will only swell
louder, "Salvation to God and the Lamb!"</p>

27—Evening—Hebrews 4:10</h3>
<p>"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his
own works, as God did from his."—Hebrews iv. 10.</p>
<p>My soul, see to it, that among other blessed evidences of thine union
and rest in Christ, thou hast this also "We which have believed," the
apostle saith, "do enter into rest." Our dependence on, and knowledge of
Jesus, are such, that we really and truly enjoy the blessings of
redemption. And as God the Father, when he had finished creation, rested
from all his works which he had made; and as Jesus, when he had finished
redemption, entered into his glory; so true believers, when they have
once found Christ, and redemption in his blood, no longer weary
themselves in the works of sin, or the works of self-righteousness, by
way of justification before God; but cease from every thing in self, and
rest with complacency and delight in the rich, free, and full salvation
that is by Christ. My soul, what sayest thou to this blessed testimony
of thine interest in Jesus? Is Jesus to thee the resting-place from sin,
from sorrow, from guilt, and the wrath to come? As God the Father rests
in him, well pleased for his righteousness sake, dost thou rest in him?
Oh! the felicity of such a rest! Jesus is indeed the rest, wherewith the
Lord causeth the weary to rest: and this is the refreshing! "Return to
thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee!"</p>

<p>"The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning
of the year even unto the end of the year."—Deut. xi. 12.</p>
<p>Oh for grace, to live always under an abiding sense of this most
blessed truth. My soul, never forget it, if possible, but always possess
in recollection an abiding apprehension of Jesus's gracious presence.
And do thou, dearest Lord, when thou art coming forth in mercies, give
me grace to. be going forth to meet thee with praises: and while thou
art bartering thy riches for my poverty, let all thy bounties be doubly
sweetened in coming from thine own hand, and being sanctified by thy
blessing, that I may receive all to my soul's joy, and to the praise of
the Father's grace in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>"The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch
unto prayer."—1 Peter iv. 7.</p>
<p>My soul, how hath the year been hastening from thee, and thou
hastening in it from the world! Where are the days fled? They are gone
to be numbered with the years beyond the flood; and thou art now
standing as on the isthmus of time. "The end of all things is at hand."
Friends are dying around thee, thou art dying thyself; yea, the world is
dying: and the end of all things is at hand. In this state, my Lord,
well may I look up to thee! Circumstances so very solemn may well induce
soberness, and watchfulness unto prayer. Yes! blessed Jesus! I would
pray thee to induce in me every suited state, that every faculty may be
on the watch tower, waiting my Lord's coming. Thou hast said: "Yet a
little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry."
Oh! then for grace to live by faith on thee; and so to live, that when I
change worlds, I may not change my company. For if in time I live with
Christ, and enjoy Christ; I shall not live less with Christ, nor enjoy
Christ less, when I exchange time for eternity! Lord Jesus! be thou my
watchfulness unto prayer, and thou wilt be, both now and then, in life
and death, my portion for ever.</p>

29—Morning—Joshua 23:14</h3>
<p>"Not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your
God spake concerning you."—Joshua xxiii. 14.</p>
<p>Say, my soul, in looking back the past year, canst thou set thy seal
to this truth? Is there a promise which thy God hath not fulfilled? Is
there an instance in which God hath forfeited his word? Canst thou point
to the time, or place, in any one trial, or under any one affliction, in
which thou hast not found God faithful? Give then the Lord the honour
due unto his name. If not one thing hath failed, proclaim his glory, set
forth his praise, declare his truth, let the father to the children make
known that God is faithful. And Oh let thine heart bear testimony to
what must be said of all his Israel, in all ages, "What hath God
wrought."</p>

29—Evening—Genesis 47:9</h3>
<p>"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been."—Gen.
xlvii. 9.</p>
<p>My soul, in looking back upon thy life, mayest thou not well take up
the same language as the patriarch, and confess that "few and evil have
thy days been?" Surely the review appears like the heath of a desert,
"that knoweth not when good cometh!" Out of Jesus, and considered
without an eye to him, there is not a single circumstance of real merit,
or of real happiness to be seen. The whole of life, from the days of
childhood, through all its intermediate stages, presents but one view
"of vanity and vexation of spirit? Precious Jesus! what would the
arithmetic of life have been in the now departing year, or in the
departure of myself from the world, but for thee? Hadst thou not
graciously sought me, when I sought not thee: hadst thou not opened to
me" the good old way, trodden by the patriarchs, and guided and held up
my feet in following them; had not Jesus been my way, and truth, and
life; what a sad conclusion should I now have had to make of the "few
and evil days of my pilgrimage?" Blessed Lord I go before me all the
remainder of the untrodden paths, and be thou to me "the pillar of cloud
by day, and the pillar of fire by night." Bring me, Lord, to the inns of
thine ordinances, and to thine house of prayer, and cause me to drink
out of "the wells of salvation." Oh! for increasing knowledge of thee,
my Lord, and for the increasing enjoyment of thee, that I may "go from
strength to strength, until my pilgrimage be over, and I come to appear
before my God in Zion!"</p>

30—Morning—1 Samuel 7:12</h3>
<p>"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mispeh and Shen, and
called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, hitherto hath the Lord helped
us."—1 Sam. vii. 12</p>
<p>Did Samuel do this? Was that servant of the Lord, who lived not to
see Christ in the flesh, so full of faith in the coming Saviour, and in
the experience of Jehovah's faithfulness in what was past, that he set
up his Ebenezer? Surely, my soul, thou wilt blush to be outdone by the
prophet, when thou hast not only seen the day of the Son of man
completed, but felt his power. Oh my soul, let thine Ebenezer be Jesus!
Let the stone thou settest up, be indeed the Rock of Ages. Yes, my soul,
set up Jesus indeed, in all places, at all times, upon all occasions.
And Oh Lord, do thou by thy blessed Spirit set up thyself in my heart,
and enthrone thyself there, and reign and rule there for ever. Surely,
my soul, Jesus is thine every-day Ebenezer; for he not only hath
hitherto helped, but lie doth help, and will help, and be himself thine
help, thy God, thy Portion, thy Jesus, for evermore.</p>

<p>"A building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens."—2 Cor. v. 1.</p>
<p>My soul, after thy last evening's meditation on the shortness and
unsatisfying nature of life, let thy present thoughts be occupied in
beholding, with steady faith, the great contrast to it: and see whether
thy confidence be as strong, and well founded, as the apostle's. His was
not a mere hope only, but an assurance in Jesus. "We know, (saith he)
that if this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." Dost thou know this?
Is Jesus thy foundation? Hath God thy Father built for thee? And doth
the Holy Ghost set his almighty hand to the work, in sweetly witnessing
to the writings, and sealing the deed, that it is thine? Oh! the
blessedness to know this, to live already in the enjoyment of it; and
while the pins of thy earthly tabernacle are daily loosening, and taking
out, to be looking with full assurance of an entrance into this house
"not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!"</p>

31—Morning—Numbers 6:22-27</h3>
<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto Aaron, and unto
his sons, saying, on this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel,
saying unto them, the Lord bless thee, and keep thee. The Lord make his
face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his
countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name
upon the children of Israel, and i will bless them."—Numb. vi.
22—27.</p>
<p>Pause, my soul, and in these sweet words behold thine almighty Aaron,
even Jesus, in his everlasting priesthood, day by day, thus blessing his
people. Observe, the blessing in the name of the Lord Jehovah is thrice
pronounced, as if to teach the plurality of Persons in the Godhead. And
observe also, after this blessing thrice pronounced, Jehovah, as if to
intimate the unity of the divine essence, declares, I will bless them.
My soul, mark each. The first may be considered as the personal blessing
of God the Father, whose gracious office it is in the work of redemption
to bless and keep his people. The second is the peculiar mercy of Jesus,
whose face is always upon his people, and his grace their portion. And
the third is the work of God the Holy Ghost, when his blessed influences
are shed abroad upon the soul, in the light of his divine countenance.
And, my soul, observe further, how personally this blessing from the
Holy Three in One is, to each individual; it is to thee, even to thee.
And, my soul, do not forget nor overlook this vast privilege in the
blessing: Aaron, the great high priest of the church, could only pray
for the people that these mercies might be upon them; but thy great High
Priest, the Lord Jesus, confirms them. His language is, Father, I will.
And God having raised up his Son Jesus, hath sent him to bless us. Here
then, blessed, precious Jesus, thou great High Priest of my soul! close
the day, every day, close the year, close my life, whenever thou shalt
be pleased to call me home, in thus blessing me. Lord, put thy name upon
me, and upon all thy church and people, and we shall be most blessed
indeed, in life, in death, and for evermore. Amen. Hallelujah: Amen.</p>

<p>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."—2 Cor. xiii.
14.</p>
<p>Here, my soul, set up thy pillar. Baptised as thou hast been into the
joint name, love, praise, and adoration, of the Holy Three in One; and
blessed as thou hast been, and art, in their joint mercies, grace, and
favour; here every day, and all the day, seek thy portion and blessing,
as the united source of all thy salvation. End the year, and begin the
year, under those precious tokens of God in Christ; and daily keep up a
lively communion and friendship with each, as the blessed cause of all
thine happiness. Jehovah, in his threefold character of person, is
engaged to perfect what he hath begun: and it is, and should be thy
happiness to be for ever viewing the testimonies of it, in the holy
scriptures of truth. God thy Father hath so loved the church in Jesus,
as to give him to the church, and the church to him; and God the Son
hath so loved the church, as to give himself for it; zeal for his
Father's honour, and longing for the salvation of his people, led him
through all the work of redemption, and now engageth his heart, until he
hath brought home all his redeemed to glory: and God the Holy Ghost is
unceasingly engaged to render the whole effectual, by taking of the
things of Christ, and shewing them to his people. See to it then, my
soul, that every day, and all the day, thou hast the love-tokens of each
person of the Godhead; for this will make thee blessed upon earth, and
blessed to all eternity. Hail! holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
Bless both him that writes, and him that reads, with thy grace: and open
and close the year with grace, until grace be consummated in everlasting
glory. Amen and Amen.</p>
